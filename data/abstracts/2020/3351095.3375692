The FAT* conference has begun the necessary conversation on the
normative implications and ethical ramifications of sociotechnical
systems. However, many scholars have pointed to the limitations
in methodologies and scope of analysis (e.g. [8, 11]). In addition to
these critiques, we add in the fact that those who are most affected
by this technology do not have the skills, training, or technical
aptitude to participate in these conversations. With the exception
of the 2018 FAT* tutorial which featured Terrance Wilkerson (who
had been labeled as likely to highly recidivate by COMPAS) and
his partner, there has been silence from those most impacted by
algorithmic unfairness at FAT*. This silence has been deafening,
as FAT* conversations – with a few notable exceptions (e.g. [1, 4])
– have failed to discuss anti-racist politics, prison abolition, and
social justice.
In response to these well-founded critiques, we offer CtrlZ.AI,
zine fair focused on technology and AI. This event will center per-
spectives and methodologies often overlooked by the FAT* commu-
nity. By pairing CtrlZ.AI with FAT*, we hope to bring the academic
research community into conversation with artists, activists, and
diverse communities affected by algorithmic systems.
Zines are self-published, self-distributed, small-circulation mag-
azines. Both the creation and distribution of zines tends to operate
outside the bounds of mainstream commercial settings, providing
an accessible and liberating alternative to those who may be ex-
cluded from or constrained by traditional publishing options. Zine
culture also plays an important community building role through
person-to-person dissemination and an emphasis on knowledge
sharing and personal experiences.
Our CRAFT workshop will bring the FAT* community into con-
versation with artists, activists, and communities affected by these
technologies. We chose to place this engagement within the context
of a zine fair since zine culture embodies an alternative orienta-
tion and mindset. Specifically, zines represent an accessible and
community-oriented mode of creating and disseminating content.
Modern day zine culture has been embraced by many different
marginalized communities [2]; zines tend to center narrative con-
tent and lived experiences. For instance, Mimi Onuoha and Mother

Cyborg’s "A People’s Guide to AI" [10] connects AI to the ubiquity
of automated decision-making systems in everyday life and relates
AI development to issues of access, power, and speculative futures
(2018).
By centering the way in which diverse communities experience
technologies, we hope to bring fresh and important perspectives
into the FAT* community. In accordance with similar interventions,
such as theDesign Justice andOurData Bodies projects, we envision
an environment in which the knowledge and life experiences from
these communities are centered and taken seriously. As discussed
further below, we will provide a space for DIY creators to circulate
and showcase their work. Zines also play an important role in
subversive social movements and grassroots activism communities
[5–7]. FAT* has been criticized for its tendency to shy away from
justice oriented discourse and work [3]. We hope this zine fair with
provide an opportunity for data and tech justice advocates to come
into conversation with the FAT* community. We also recognize
zines as important knowledge-sharing and community-building
tools [9]. In addition to creating a platform for activists and artists
to showcase their work, we will also facilitate a session whereby
collective learnings and experiences can be distilled into a zine with
low barriers to both creation and readership.
The CtrlZ.AI zine and art fair will run for eight hours at an
external site and consist of four components. First, the fair itself
will be open to a set of contributing tablers who will present and
sell their own work. Second, we will feature a curated selection
of physical zines available from contributors who cannot be co-
present for the fair. Third, we will call for artifacts which may not
be full zines, but can be incorporated or fleshed out in the course of
the event. This can include images, quotes, or parts of zines which
are unfinished prior to the event. Lastly, we will hold three hours
of workshop sessions over the course of the event.
