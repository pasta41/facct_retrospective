ABSTRACT
There are gaps in understanding in and between those who design
systems of AI/ ML, those who critique them, and those positioned
between these discourses. This gap can be defined in multiple ways
- e.g. methodological, epistemological, linguistic, or cultural. To
bridge this gap requires a set of translations: the generation of
a collaborative space and a new set of shared sensibilities that
traverse disciplinary boundaries. This workshop aims to explore
translations across multiple fields, and translations between theory
and practice, as well as how interdisciplinary work could generate
new operationalizable approaches.
We define ‘knowledge’ as a social product (L. Code) which re-
quires fair and broad epistemic cooperation in its generation, devel-
opment, and dissemination. As a “marker for truth” (B. Williams)
and therefore a basis for action, knowledge circulation sustains the
systems of power which produce it in the first place (M. Foucault).
Enabled by epistemic credence, authority or knowledge, epistemic
power can be an important driver of, but also result from, other
(e.g. economic, political) powers.
To produce reliable output, our standards and methods should
serve us all and exclude no-one. Critical theorists have long revealed
failings of epistemic practices, resulting in the marginalization and
exclusion of some types of knowledge. How can we cultivate more
reflexive epistemic practices in the interdisciplinary research setting
of FAT*?
We frame this ideal as ‘epistemic justice’ (M. Geuskens), the pos-
itive of ‘epistemic injustice’, defined by M. Fricker as injustice that
exists when people are wronged as a knower or as an epistemic
subject. Epistemic justice is the proper use and allocation of epis-
temic power; the inclusion and balancing of all epistemic sources.

As S. Jasanoff reminds us, any authoritative way of seeing must be
legitimized in discourse and practice, showing that practices can be
developed to value and engage with other viewpoints and possibly
reshape our ways of knowing.
Our workshop aims to address the following questions: how
could critical theory or higher level critiques be translated into
and anchored in ML/AI design practices - and vice versa? What
kind of cartographies and methodologies are needed in order to
identify issues that can act as the basis of collaborative research and
design? How can we (un)learn our established ways of thinking for
such collaborative work to take place? During the workshop, par-
ticipants will create, share and explode prototypical workflows of
designing, researching and critiquing algorithmic systems. We will
identify moments in which translations and interdisciplinary inter-
ventions could or should happen in order to build actionable steps
and methodological frameworks that advance epistemic justice and
are conducive to future interdisciplinary collaboration.
