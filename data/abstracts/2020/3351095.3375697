ABSTRACT 
Whether one is speaking of barbed wire, the assembly line or 
computer operating systems, the history of coercive technologies 
for the automation of tasks has focused on optimization, 
determinate outcomes and an ongoing disciplining of components 
and bodies. Automated technologies of the present emerge and are 
marked by this lineage of coercive modes of implementation, 
whose scarred history of techniques of discrimination, 
exploitation and extraction point to an archive of automated 
injustices in computing, a history that continues to charge present 
paradigms and practices of computing.  
This workshop addresses the history of coercive technologies 
through attuning to how we perform speculation within practices 
of computing through a renewed attention to this history. We go 
backwards into the archive, rather than racing forward and 
proposing ever new speculative futures of automation. This is 
because speculative creative approaches are often conceived and 
positioned as methodological toolkits for addressing computing 
practices by imagining for/with others for a “future otherwise”. 
We argue that “speculation” as the easy-go-to of designers and 
artists trying to address automated injustices needs some undoing, 
as without work it will always be confined within ongoing 
legacies of coercive modes of computing practice. Instead of 
creating more just-worlds, the generation of ever-new futures by 
creative speculation often merely reinforces the project of 
coercive computing.  
For this workshop, drawing on queer approaches to resisting 
futures and informed by activist feminist engagements with 
archives, we invite participants to temporarily resist imagining 
futures and instead to speculate backwards. We speculate 
backwards to various moments, artefacts and practices within 
computing history. What does it mean to understand techniques of 
computing and automation as coercive infrastructures? How did 
so many of the dreams and seeming promises of computing turn 
into the coercive practices that we see today? Has computing as a 
practice become so imbued with coercive techniques that we find 
it hard to imagine otherwise? Together, we will build a 
speculative understanding and possible archive of non-coercive 
computing.  In the words of Alexis Pauline Gumbs, the emerging 
archive proposes "how did their dreams make rooms to dream 
in"... or not, in the case of coercive practices of computing. And 
"what if she changes her dream?" What if we reboot this dream?1
