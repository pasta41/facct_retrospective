ABSTRACT 
What are the core ways the field of data science can center 
community voice and power throughout all the processes involved 
in conceptualizing, creating, and disseminating technology?? What 
are the most possible and most urgent ways communities can shape 
the field of algorithmic decision-making to center community 
power in the next few years? 
This interactive workshop will highlight some of the following 
lessons learned through our combined experience engaging with 
communities challenging technology in Seattle and Philadelphia, 
cities in the United States. We will discuss the historical context of 
disproportionate impacts of technology on marginalized and 
vulnerable communities; case studies including criminal justice 
risk assessments, face surveillance technologies, and surveillance 
regulations; and work in small-group and break-out sessions to 
engage questions about when and where technologists hold power, 
serve as gatekeepers, and can work in accountable partnership with 
impacted communities.  
By the end of the session, we hope that participants will learn how 
to actively center diverse communities in creating technology by 
examining successes, challenges, and ongoing work in Seattle and 
Philadelphia, through the following lessons we have learned: 
• that communities, policy-makers, and technologists need to
work intimately together to lift up each other’s’ goals
• that communities need to gain data justice and data literacy to
understand and independently audit how a system is impacting
them
• that scientific analyses of algorithmic bias are powerful but
heard most clearly when lifted up by local community
members and stakeholders in decisions where algorithms
might be deployed
• that anecdotal stories of harm are most impactful on decision-
makers when tied to rigorous scientific analysis and examples
from other communities that amplify and ground those stories
• that communities and community goals and standards are
often not heard in conversations between data scientists and
people who deploy algorithms, as well as in decision-makers’
conversations about what policy should look like
• and that we need to begin to craft what it means for those with
the least power in conversations about algorithmic fairness -
those judged by those tools - to have far more, or even the
most power in the future of their design or implementation.
