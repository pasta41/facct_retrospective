ABSTRACT
Critiques of ‘algorithmic fairness’ have counseled against
a purely technical approach. Recent work from the FAT*
conference has warned specifically about abstracting away
the social context that these automated systems are operating
within and has suggested that "[fairness work] require[s]
technical researchers to learn new skills or partner with
social scientists" [Fairness and abstraction in sociotechnical
systems, Selbst et al. 2019, FAT* ’19]. That “social context”
includes groups outside the academy organizing for data
and/or tech justice (e.g., Allied Media Projects, Stop LAPD
Spying Coalition, data4blacklives, etc). These struggles have
deep historical roots but have become prominent in the past
several years alongside broader citizen-science efforts. In
this CRAFT session we as STEM researchers hope to initiate
conversation about methods used by community organizers
to analyze power relations present in that social context. We
will take this time to learn together and discuss if/how these
and other methods, collaborations and efforts can be used
to actualize oft-mentioned critiques of algorithmic fairness
and move toward a data justice-oriented approach.
Many scholars and activists have spoken on how to ap-
proach social context when discussing algorithmic fairness
interventions. Community organizing and attendant meth-
ods for power analysis present one such approach: docu-
menting all stakeholders and entities relevant to an issue
and the nature of the power differentials between them. The
facilitators for this session are not experts in community
organizing theory or practice. Instead, we will share what
we have learned from our readings of decades of rich work
and writings from community organizers. This session is a

collective, interdisciplinary learning experience, open to all
who see their interests as relevant to the conversation.
We will open with a discussion of community organizing
practice: What is community organizing, what are its goals,
methods, past and ongoing examples? What disciplines and
intellectual lineages does it draw from? We will incorpo-
rate key sources we have found helpful for synthesizing
this knowledge so that participants can continue exposing
themselves to the field after the conference. We will also
consider the concept of social power, including power that
the algorithmic fairness community holds. Noting that there
are many ways to theorize and understand power, we will
share the framings that have been most useful to us. We plan
to present different tools, models and procedures for doing
power analysis in various organizing settings.
We will propose to our group that we conduct a power
analysis of our own. We have prepared a hypothetical but
realistic scenario involving risk assessment in a hospital
setting as an example. However, we encourage participants
to bring their own experiences to the table, especially if
they pertain in any way to data injustice. We also invite
participants to bring examples of ongoing organizing efforts
with which algorithmic fairness researchers could act in
solidarity. Participants will walk away from this session with
1) an understanding of the key terms and sources necessary
to gain further exposure to these topics and 2) preliminary
experience analyzing power in realistic, grounded scenarios.
