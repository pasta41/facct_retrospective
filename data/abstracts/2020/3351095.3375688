ABSTRACT 
Research in fairness, accountability, and transparency (FAT) in 
socio-technical systems needs to take into account how practices 
of computing are entrenched with power relations in complex and 
multi-layered ways. Trying to disentangle the way in which 
structural discrimination and normative computational concepts 
and methods are intertwined, this frequently raises the question of 
WHO are the actors that shape technologies and research 
agendas—who gets to speak and to define bias, (un)fairness, and 
discrimination? “Deconstructing FAT” is a CRAFT workshop that 
aims at complicating this question by asking how “we” as 
researchers in FAT (often unknowingly) mobilize implicit 
assumptions, values and beliefs that reflect our own 
embeddedness in power relations, our disciplinary ways of 
thinking, and our historically, locally, and culturally-informed 
ways of solving computational problems or approaching our 
research. This is a vantage point to make visible and analyze the 
normativity of technical approaches, concepts and methods that 
are part of the repertoire of FAT research. Inspired by a previous 
international workshop [1], this CRAFT workshop engages an 
interdisciplinary panel of FAT researchers in a deconstruction 
exercise that traces the following issues: 
(1) FAT research frequently speaks of social bias that is amplified 
by algorithmic systems, of the problem of discriminatory 
consequences that is to be solved, and of underprivileged or 
vulnerable groups that need to be protected. What does this 
perspectivity imply in terms of the approaches, methods and 
metrics that are being applied? How do methods of debiasing and 
discrimination-awareness enact the epistemic power of a 
perspective of privilege as their norm? 
(2) FAT research has emphasized the need for multi- or 
interdisciplinary approaches to get a grip on the complex 
intertwining of social power relations and the normativity of 
computational methods, norms and practices. Clearly, multi- and 
interdisciplinary research includes different normative 
frameworks and ways of thinking that need to be negotiated. This 
is complicated by the fact that these frameworks are not fully 
transparent and ready for reflection. What are the normative 
implications of interdisciplinary collaboration in FAT research?  
(3) While many problems of discrimination, marginalization and 
exploitation can be similar across places, they can also have 
specific local shapes. How can FAT research e.g. consider 
historically grown specifics such as the effects of different 
colonial histories? If these specifics make patterns of 
discrimination have different and more nuanced dimensions than 
clear-cut ‘redlining’, what does this imply? 
To explore these questions, we use the method of ‘mind scripting’ 
which is based in theories of discourse, ideology, memory and 
affect and aims at investigating hidden patterns of meaning 
making in written memories of the panelists [2]. The workshop 
strives to challenge some of the implicit norms and tensions in 
FAT research and to trigger future directions.
