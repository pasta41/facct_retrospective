ABSTRACT 
This paper uses a theory of oppression to ground and extend 
algorithmic oppression. Algorithmic oppression is then situated 
through a Black feminist lens part of which entails highlighting 
the double bind of technology. To reconcile algorithmic 
oppression with respect to the fairness, accountability, and 
transparency community, I critique the language of the 
community. Lastly, I place algorithmic oppression in a broader 
conversation of feminist science, technology, and society studies 
to ground the discussion of ways forward through abolition and 
empowering marginalized communities.
