ABSTRACT
The University of California suspended through 2024 the require-
ment that applicants from California submit SAT scores, upending
the major role standardized testing has played in college admissions.
We study the impact of such decisions and its interplay with other
policies—such as affirmative action—on admitted class composition.
This paper considers a theoretical framework to study the effect
of requiring test scores on academic merit and diversity in college
admissions. The model has a college and set of potential students.
Each student has observed application components and group mem-
bership, as well as an unobserved noisy skill level generated from
an observed distribution. The college is Bayesian and maximizes
an objective that depends on both diversity and merit. It estimates
each applicant’s true skill level using the observed features and
potentially their group membership, and then admits students with
or without affirmative action.
We characterize the trade-off between the (potentially positive)
informational role of standardized testing in college admissions
and its (negative) exclusionary nature. Dropping test scores may
exacerbate disparities by decreasing the amount of information
available for each applicant, especially those from non-traditional
backgrounds. However, if there are substantial barriers to testing,
removing the test improves both academic merit and diversity by
increasing the size of the applicant pool.
Finally, using application and transcript data from the University
of Texas at Austin, we demonstrate how an admissions committee
could measure the trade-off in practice to better decide whether to
drop their test scores requirement.
