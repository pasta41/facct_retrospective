ABSTRACT
This paper examines the role of technology firms in computerizing
personality tests from the early 1960s to late 1980s. It focuses on the
National Computer Systems (NCS) and their development of an au-
tomated interpretation for the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
inventory (MMPI). NCS trumpeted their computerized interpreta-
tion as a way to free up clerical labor and mitigate human bias. Yet
psychologists cautioned that proprietary algorithms risked obscur-
ing decision rules. I show how clinics, courtrooms, and businesses
all had competing interests in the use of computerized personality
tests. As I argue, the development of computerized psychologi-
cal tests was shaped both by business concerns about intellectual
property and profits and psychologists’ concerns with validity and
access to algorithms. Across these domains, the common claim was
that computerized psychological testing could provide a techni-
cal fix for bias. This paper contributes to histories of computing
emphasizing the importance of IP, the relationship between labor,
technology, and expertise, and to histories of algorithms.
