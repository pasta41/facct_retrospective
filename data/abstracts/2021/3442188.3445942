ABSTRACT
Automated decision-making systems implemented in public life are
typically standardized. One algorithmic decision-making system
can replace thousands of human deciders. Each of the humans so
replaced had her own decision-making criteria: some good, some
bad, and some arbitrary. Is such arbitrariness of moral concern?
We argue that an isolated arbitrary decision need not morally
wrong the individual whom it misclassifies. However, if the same
algorithms are applied across a public sphere, such as hiring or lend-
ing, a person could be excluded from a large number of opportuni-
ties. This harm persists even when the automated decision-making
systems are “fair” on standard metrics of fairness. We argue that
such arbitrariness at scale is morally problematic and propose tech-
nically informed solutions that can lessen the impact of algorithms
at scale and so mitigate or avoid the moral harms we identify.
