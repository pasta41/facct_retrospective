ABSTRACT
Price discrimination – offering different prices to different cus-
tomers – has become common practice. While it allows sellers
to increase their profits, it also raises several concerns in terms
of fairness. This topic has received extensive attention from me-
dia, industry, and regulatory agencies. In this paper, we consider
the problem of setting prices for different groups under fairness
constraints.
In this paper, we propose a formal framework for pricing with
fairness, including several definitions of fairness and their potential
impact on consumers, sellers, and society at large. In a first step
towards the ambitious agenda of designing pricing strategies that
are fair, we consider the simplest scenario of a single-product seller
facing consumers who can be partitioned into two groups based
on a single, binary feature observable to the seller. For each group,
we assume that the seller knows the valuation distribution and the
population size. The seller’s goal is to maximize profit by optimally
selecting a price for each group, subject to a fairness constraint
which may be self-imposed or explicitly enforced by laws and
regulations.
We first propose four definitions: fairness in price, demand, con-
sumer surplus, and no-purchase valuation. With our model and
definitions in place, we first show that satisfying all four fairness
goals simultaneously is impossible unless the mean valuations are
the same for both groups. In fact, even achieving two fairness mea-
sures simultaneously cannot be done in basic settings. We then
consider the impact of imposing each fairness criterion separately,
and identify conditions under which the consumer surplus and the
social welfare increase or decrease. Under linear or exponential
demand, we show that imposing a small amount of fairness in price
or no-purchase valuation increases social welfare, whereas fairness
in demand or surplus reduces social welfare. We fully characterize
the impact of imposing different types of fairness for linear demand.
We discover that imposing too much price fairness may result in a
lower social welfare relative to imposing no price fairness. Imposing
demand and surplus fairness always decreases social welfare. How-
ever, imposing no-purchase valuation fairness always increases
social welfare. We also extend our results to the cases when there
are multiple groups or there is an unprotected feature.

Finally, we computationally show that most of our findings con-
tinue to hold for three common nonlinear demand models. Our
results and insights provide a first step in understanding the impact
of imposing fairness in the context of pricing.
