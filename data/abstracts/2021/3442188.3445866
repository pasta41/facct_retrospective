ABSTRACT
The societal and ethical implications of the use of opaque
artificial intelligence systems in consequential decisions, such
as welfare allocation and criminal justice, have generated a
lively debate among multiple stakeholders, including com-
puter scientists, ethicists, social scientists, policy makers, and
end users. However, the lack of a common language or a
multi-dimensional framework to appropriately bridge the
technical, epistemic, and normative aspects of this debate
nearly prevents the discussion from being as productive as
it could be. Drawing on the philosophical literature on the
nature and value of explanations, this paper offers a multi-
faceted framework that brings more conceptual precision to
the present debate by identifying the types of explanations
that are most pertinent to artificial intelligence predictions,
recognizing the relevance and importance of the social and
ethical values for the evaluation of these explanations, and
demonstrating the importance of these explanations for incor-
porating a diversified approach to improving the design of
truthful algorithmic ecosystems. The proposed philosophical
framework thus lays the groundwork for establishing a perti-
nent connection between the technical and ethical aspects of
artificial intelligence systems.
