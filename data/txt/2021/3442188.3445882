ABSTRACT
Consider a cost-sharing game with players of di￿erent costs: an
example might be an insurance company calculating premiums for
a population of mixed-risk individuals. Two natural and competing
notions of fairness might be to a) charge each individual the same or
b) charge each individual according to the cost that they bring to the
pool. In the insurance literature, these approaches are referred to
as “solidarity” and “actuarial fairness” and are commonly viewed as
opposites. However, in insurance (and many other natural settings),
the cost-sharing game also exhibits externalities of size: all else being
equal, larger groups have lower average cost. In the insurance case,
we analyze model where costs strictly decreases with pooling due to
a reduction in the variability of losses. In this paper, we explore how
this complicates traditional understandings of fairness, drawing on
literature in cooperative game theory.
First, we explore solidarity: we show that it is possible for both
groups (high risk and low risk) to strictly bene￿t by joining an
insurance pool where costs are evenly split, as opposed to being in
separate risk pools. We build on this by producing a pricing scheme
that maximally subsidizes the high risk group, while maintaining an
incentive for lower risk people to stay in the insurance pool. Next,
we demonstrate that with this new model, the price charged to each
individual has to depend on the risk of other participants, making
naive actuarial fairness ine￿cient. Furthermore, we prove that
stable pricing schemes must be ones where players have the anti-
social incentive desiring riskier partners, contradicting motivations
for using actuarial fairness. Finally, we describe how these results
relate to debates about fairness in machine learning and potential
avenues for future research.

1 INTRODUCTION
Imagine the following situation: an individual wishes to purchase
car insurance and goes to her local insurance company. The insur-
ance company combines her with other people insuring cars of
the same value. Within the insurance pool, some people are at low
risk of being in an accident and some people at a high risk. The
insurance company calculates a total amount of premiums that it
needs to collect from the entire set of people: higher risk individu-
als contribute more to this total than lower risk individuals. How
should total premiums be divided into prices for each individual?
One suggestion is to charge people proportional to their risk
level, requiring those who bring more cost to the insurance pool to
pay more. However, there may be reasons to avoid this approach:
what if individuals aren’t responsible for their risk status? Consider
a case where lower risk people live in suburbs with little tra￿c,
while higher risk people tend to live in dense urban areas — and
consider that these patterns may be due to economic inequality or
racial discrimination. In this case, there might be normative reasons
to favor dividing total premiums evenly among policy-holders.
The question of how to divide insurance premiums has been
debated extensively in the insurance literature, as we review in
Section 2. In general, this literature casts these two choices — pro-
portional pricing (related to the idea of actuarial fairness) or equal
pricing (related to the idea of solidarity) — as strict opposites. How-
ever, we show that this idea assumes a fairly simplistic form of
premium calculation. In this work, we will explore the impact of a
slightly more realistic model: one involving externalities of size.
Simply put, a model exhibits externalities of size when, all else
being equal, larger groups have lower average cost. For the insur-
ance example, we will demonstrate in Section 3 how insurance
pools help reduce variance and thereby bring down total costs in
ways that can bene￿t all members of the pool. However, our results
are not limited solely to the insurance case: all of theoretical proofs
are given for general cost functions and would apply to any systems
exhibiting similar properties.
Externalities of size complicate current debates in the Fairness,
Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) community: when an
individual can both be responsible for increasing costs (due to being
higher risk) and decreasing costs (due to externalities of size), how
should we reason about which price to charge her? Cooperative

game theory has analyzed this question, but from a di￿erent angle:
the questions there focus on how to charge more costly individuals
an appropriately greater amount, in keeping with actuarial fairness,
whereas the FAccT community is more interested in questions of
equity and equality, as championed by advocates of solidarity.
As mentioned before, our results hold for general cost-sharing
situations, but throughout this workwewill focus on the application
area of insurance. There are two main reasons for this focus: ￿rstly,
there is a rich literature in philosophy, law, sociology, and history
debating the meaning of fairness in insurance. We draw on this
literature to motivate our analysis and use our results to challenge
some of the entrenched thinking and suggest potential avenues of
future research. The second motivation for focusing on insurance
is that there already exists a natural model for premium calculation
with externalities of size. In Section 2, we describe this model and
discuss how it satis￿es our desired properties. In this work, we
will explicitly not analyze health insurance, which is so essential to
well-being that many societies treat it as a right.
In later sections, our analysis will show that, due to externalities
of size, the distinction between actuarial fairness and solidarity
quickly blurs. In Section 6, we are motivated by cases where exter-
nalities of size may make it easier to accomplish solidaristic goals.
First, we show that, for some situations, it is possible that evenly
splitting premiums ends up producing prices that are strictly lower
than what either the low or high risk participants would get in
homogeneous pools. We additionally de￿ne and analyze a pric-
ing method that allows us to maximally subisidize the higher risk
participants while still remaining stable against defections.
In Section 7, we turn to actuarial fairness. First, we show that
certain properties of actuarial fairness are impossible to simulta-
neously achieve with externalities of size. For example, a pricing
scheme that is indi￿erent to risk levels of other participants is also
one that is ine￿cient. Additionally, we show that a pricing scheme
that is both stable and e￿cient is one where players have the anti-
social incentive of wishing that other players have higher risk. We
discuss how these results might have implications for debates in
fairness within the insurance literature and more broadly.
2 MOTIVATING LITERATURE
2.1 Debates over fairness in insurance:
solidarity and actuarial fairness
The history of insurance and premium calculation in the West-
ern world is a surprisingly rich and fascinating one. Historically,
harmful events were not understood as chance occurrences; rather,
“accidents and diseases were seen as a punishment for objection-
able deeds, known only to God and the sinner” [5]. Spreading the
burdens of these misfortunes across a larger group of people made
no sense under this worldview, as someone’s chance of experienc-
ing a misfortune was thought to be entirely under their control
[6]. It was only during the industrial revolution that these views
started to change, as workplace accidents began to be seen as not
necessarily the fault of workers or managers, but as “inherent to
industrialization itself,” leading some to conclude “that the old rule
of responsibility was obsolete” [5].
Instead, insurance allowed multiple people to pool and manage
risks communally. A rare but disastrous accident, like a house ￿re,
could be insured against for a ￿xed sum, with the common result
that all participants bene￿ted. In this respect, Lehtonen and Liukko
[19] write that insurance should be understood as “a central yet
often inconspicuous infrastructure supporting the Western way of
life”. Horan [14] has likewise argued that insurance played a critical
role in helping reshape American life in the post-World War II era.
But if insurance increased welfare, it also raised questions of how
its costs should be divided into premiums.
The most natural choice might be to simply calculate the neces-
sary total amount of money required to insure a group of people
and then divide the cost evenly between them. But as actuarial
science grew more sophisticated, it became apparent that certain
individuals had a greater chance of su￿ering a loss than others. Is
it really right that they should pay the same amount?
Arrow [2] would answer “no”: this seminal work de￿ned actuar-
ially fair pricing as that in which each participant in the insurance
pool pays their expected costs. One motivation for using actuar-
ial fairness is that failing to do so could lead to adverse selection.
Adverse selection is the phenomenon where a pricing scheme that
charges high and low risk individuals the same amount ends up
incentivizing low risk individuals to leave, either forming their own
(cheaper) pool under a di￿erent insurance company or to leave the
insurance market altogether. The remaining insurance pool has
higher average risk and is thus more expensive, which may con-
vince the remaining lower risk individuals to leave as well, starting a
potential “death spiral.” (Empirically, adverse selection has proven a
less serious threat to insurance markets [24] than this theory would
suggest.) Beyond adverse selection, we may object to equal pricing
because it invites “moral hazard”: unless policyholders face some
￿nancial consequences for doing so, they may engage in needlessly
risky behavior. The concerns with moral hazard are both practical
and normative. Most immediately, the problem with such behavior
is that it raises the total cost that must be borne by the risk pool.
But it also provokes objections on the ground that it is nor fair for
an individual to saddle other people with the costs of their reckless
behavior [20]. For this reason, actuarial fairness is sometimes justi-
￿ed on the basis that “it is unfair for some individuals to bear costs
stemming from the actions of others” [18].
Of course, this view isn’t universally held: a di￿erent view is
solidarity, which holds that groups with di￿erent risks should nev-
ertheless still pay equal premiums. This view holds that charging
di￿erent premiums runs counter to the purpose of insurance, which
is to spread the costs of events outside an individual’s control across
the collective. In contrast, actuarial fairness is ultimately indi￿erent
to whether someone is responsible for their risk status: the dan-
ger of adverse selection would seem to compel insurers to charge
higher-risk policyholders a higher price even if they are at higher
relative risk for no fault of their own. A solidaristic view of insur-
ance holds that its function is to help to compensate those who
happen to experience misfortune, but also those who happen to
be at greater risk of misfortune for reasons outside their control.
For example, consider a person who can only a￿ord an older car
with a higher chance of being totalled in the event of an accident.
We may not wish to charge her a higher premium because the fact
that she happens to own an older car is explained by her income
and wealth, properties over which she may have limited control. In
contrast, we might feel justi￿ed in charging her a higher price if
186

her higher risk of totalling her car is the result of reckless driving,
an activity over which she does has control. In this sense, solidarity
is about helping individuals ￿nd ways to cover the costs of each
other’s misfortunes, including the misfortune of being at greater
risk for certain bad outcomes.
2.2 Game theory
Questions of how to divide costs among participants fall into the
realm of cooperative game theory. This area studies situations where
players form coalitions that produce bene￿t or cost which must
be divided among the participants. Key questions center on which
coalitions utility-maximizing players have incentives to join and
which coalitions are “stable” against defecting groups of players.
The seminal works of Shapley [23] and Bondareva [7] analyze
certain classes of cost functions and give guarantees for stable cost-
sharing schemes. Later works, such as Csóka and Pintér [9] and
Balog et al. [4], speci￿cally use cooperative game theory to analyze
situations where risk is shared among coalitions or groups of dif-
ferent actors. However, their work di￿ers from ours because we
are considering allocating cost, rather than risk: our cost function
is based o￿ of probabilistic factors like the risks {A8 }, but theirs is
a perfectly deterministic function. Closer works to ours include
Karsten et al. [16], which analyzes “elastic” cost functions, and Guo
et al. [11], an applied example around allocating resources across
call centers (which has a cost function structurally similar to ours).
Recent papers have similarly drawn connections between the
game theory and the FAccT communities. For example, Hu and
Chen [15] demonstrates that applying strict notions of fairness can
reduce the welfare of both relevant groups. Kasy and Abebe [17] ex-
amines similar tensions, showing multiple examples where changes
that increase fairness simultaneously decrease equity and welfare.
Finally, Finocchiaro et al. [10] provides an overview of points of
contact between the mechanism design and FAccT communities.
Part of this paper’s goal is translational: to use the tools de-
veloped in cooperative game theory to shed light on avenues of
research in the insurance and fairness literature that may not have
been considered otherwise. But part of our analysis is fundamentally
di￿erent from the goals most game theory focuses on. Speci￿cally,
much of game theory relies on the idea of “fairness” as meaning
people who bring more cost to the group should pay a larger share
of the total cost. For example, Karsten et al. [16] explores multiple
variants of pricing schemes that attempt to enforce higher prices
for those who contribute higher costs. However, as discussed in the
end of Section 2.1, in many realistic cases we might say that it is
“fair” to not charge a higher-risk person more. This type of analysis
is much less explored in the game theory literature.
3 EXTERNALITIES OF SIZE
In this section, we discuss our de￿nition of externalities of size. First,
we de￿ne the term and give examples of real-world phenomena
exhibiting it. Next, in the insurance case, we demonstrate that
the literature discussed in Section 2 assumes a simpler, somewhat
unrealistic model of insurance premium calculation. However, we
show that a more realistic model, called insolvency-based premium
calculation, exhibits externalities of size.
3.1 De￿nition and examples
In this paper, we consider cases where the total cost associated
with a group is a function of the identity of people in that group.
In this case, we can consider a set function 6(·) that takes in a set
of players ( and returns a real number. One very simple example
of a 6(·) function is a linear cost-sharing game where the cost of a
set of players ( is the sum of the costs of the individual players:
6(() =
’
82(
6({8})
In this work, we argue that, in many cases, this model is too simpli-
￿ed: it ignores the relevant concept of externalities of size. Speci￿-
cally, this means that the total costs involved in a set of players ( is
strictly less than the sum of the costs of each player:
6(() <
’
82(
6({8})
There are multiple examples of real-world phenomena exhibiting
externalities of size:
• A multi-state co￿ee chain is cheaper to operate, in aggregate,
than each of the separate locations would be to run individually.
• A restaurant can cook 50 dishes with greater ease and less ex-
pense than 50 separate cooks each making one dish.
• For delivery to a large, contiguous area, a single delivery service
can be operatedwith less total cost thanmultiple delivery services
within the same area.
Note that in the cases above, the total savings hold even if individual
elements are highly unequal in their contribution to total costs:
• For the co￿ee chain, it may be the case that stores in high-rent
cities are much more expensive to operate than ones in small
towns.
• Certain dishes may be much more expensive, in time and ingre-
dients, than other dishes.
• Deliveries to remote areas may be more time-consuming and
expensive than typical deliveries.
Besides these applied examples, there has also been theoretical work
analyzing cost-sharing in a situation with unequal costs but exter-
nalities of size. For example, Herzog et al. [13] analyzes cost-sharing
in computer networking. In this case, if multiple participants build
a network together, average costs per person shrink because users
can split costs for portions of the network that they share.
3.2 Insolvency-based premiums
Next, we will analyze the cost function used in insurance literature.
For simplicity, we will assume all insurance policies cover the same
value + with a binary loss of probability A8 for individual 8 .
Meyers and Van Hoyweghen [21] describes de￿nitions of actu-
arial fairness from multiple papers and textbooks, which generally
agree that “a fairly priced insurance policy is one in which the
insurance premium is equal to the expected value of the promised
insurance payment”. This implies that an actuarially fair pricing
scheme would collect total premiums ⇠ for a set of players ( ac-
cording to the equation below:
⇠ =
’
82(
+ · A8
187
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Donahue and Barocas
Those holding a solidaristic view of insurance would disagree on
how the total premiums should be divided, but would agree that ⇠
corresponds to the correct total value. This cost function is linear,
which means that there is a sharp tension between what di￿erent
people pay. If one person pays less than his expected cost, a di￿erent
person must pay more than her expected cost in order for the total
amount of premiums collected to sum up to the amount needed.
However, though it does not appear to be discussed in the fair-
ness in insurance literature, there does already exist a model of
insurance premiums that exhibits externalities of size: insolvency-
based premiums [22].
To motivate this model, it helps to consider what insurance rep-
resents. In exchange for paying premiums, a policyholders receives
a promise from the insurance company to repay the costs that she
su￿ers in the event of a loss. A bad situation would be if the total
value of claims in a given year exceeded the total value of premiums
paid. If a “shortfall” happens, some policyholders may go uncom-
pensated. What is the probability of a shortfall? Denote the random
variable describing the total value of claims in a year by - . Using
the pricing scheme referenced in the insurance literature above, a
shortfall occurs whenever - > E[- ], which for a symmetric dis-
tribution like our model occurs with 50% chance! This probability
might be unacceptably high — and another drawback is that it does
not depend on the size of an insurance pool: a large pool would be
as likely to experience a shortfall as a small one.
An alternate pricing scheme is called insolvency-based pricing.
In this model, a premium is collected so that the probability of a
shortfall is no more than some ￿xed ?:
% (- > ⇠? )  ?
The total amount of premiums ⇠? is a function of the probability
? , which could be viewed as an external requirement, potentially
imposed by a regulator, to require that the company maintains
some level of ￿nancial stability. In this way, multiple insurance
companies are assumed to share the same cost function and di￿er
only in their composition of policyholders.
3.3 Variance reduction
For the model of insurance losses we are considering, it is possible
to perfectly calculate ⇠? . First, we will assume that policyholders
come in two types: low risk and high risk. There are =! low risk
policyholders with risk A! , and =  high risk policyholders with risk
A  > A! . As before, each is insuring a good of value + .
The total number of claims coming from the low risk participants
is distributed according to a binomial distribution with parame-
ters =! and A! . It vastly simpli￿es our analysis to approximate this
distribution as a normal distribution with expected value =! · A!
and standard deviation
p
=! · A! · (1   A!): when the =! is fairly
large, which is common in insurance applications, this is a good
approximation. Similarly, we can approximate the distribution de-
scribing the number of claims from the high risk group as a normal
distribution with expected value =  · A  and standard deviationp
=  · A  · (1   A  ). The total number of claims in a combined in-
surance pool is then a normal distribution with mean=! ·A!+=  ·A 
and standard deviation
p
=! · A! · (1   A!) + =  · A  · (1   A  ). Be-
cause each claim has an identical value + , the total value of claims
simply scales the mean and standard deviation by + .
The bene￿t of using a normal approximation becomes clear:
it is extremely straightforward to calculate ⇠? . Given a normal
distribution with mean ` and standard deviation f , ⇠? in the form
` + 1? · f produces the desired premium, where 1? is a constant
that depends on ? but not ` or f values.
These results give the amount of money that insolvency-based
premium calculation would need to collect for given population:
6({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) =
+
⇣
A! · =! + A  · =  + 1? ·
p
=! · A! · (1   A!) + =  · A  · (1   A  )
⌘
We have slightly abused notation by allowing 6(·) to stand both for
the function on =!,=  and a set function.
Note that pooling always reduces costs:
6({=!, 0}, {A!, 0}) + 6({0,=  }, {0, A  }) > 6({=!,=  }, {A!, A  })
The expected value component+ (A! · =! + A  · =  ) is the same on
both sides. However, the pooled insurance group has lower cost
through reduced variance:
+ · 1?
⇣p
=! · A! · (1   A!) +
p
=  · A  · (1   A  )
⌘
> + · 1?
⇣p
=! · A! · (1   A!) + =  · A  · (1   A  )
⌘
The standard deviation shrinks, which reduces the total amount of
money that needs to be collected.
The next lemma strengthens and formalizes these results by
showing that the cost function is submodular.
Lemma 1. For insolvency-based premium calculation, the cost func-
tion 6(·) is submodular. That is, for all sets of players ( and ) ,
6(() + 6() )   6(( [) ) + 6(( \) )
The function is strictly submodular: that is, the inequality is strict
whenever it is the case that S is not a subset of T and T is not a subset
of S, so they both have non-overlapping portions.
This proof is given in Appendix A. This property is one we will
rely on in later sections to demonstrate overall cost-savings.
3.4 Model characteristics
This section contains some additional notes on possible objections
to the insolvency-based premiummodel. First, this model as written
assumes that the insurance company doesn’t have any stockpile
of money it could use as a cushion in case costs are unexpectedly
high. In reality, insurance companies would almost surely have
such a ￿nancial cushion, but it also seems certain that would want
to be compensated ￿nancially for the opportunity cost of not using
this money in other ways. A reasonable solution would be to have
the policyholders pay enough in premiums to at least compensate
the insurance company for lost interest on the insurance stockpile:
such a scheme would produce a premium of the same form, but
with a constant in front of the 1? .
Secondly, the 6(·) function as written produces an average pre-
mium that is strictly higher than the expected value of losses. Some
might object to this: why would someone pay more than their ex-
pected loss? The key is that an individual purchasing insurance is

purchasing a reduction in the variability of their costs. For example,
consider an individual purchasing insurance in the model above.
Without insurance, her loss in each time period would have ex-
pectation A ·+ and standard deviation + ·
p
A · (1   A ). In the case
that + is large, this standard deviation could be quite large: she
might need to establish a costly ￿nancial cushion to handle this
uncertainty in her losses. If she purchases insurance, her loss each
time period is equal to her premium⇠ —with 0 standard deviation.
The ability to have consistency in her losses might be very valuable
to her, which explains why she would be willing to pay a premium
⇠  that is strictly greater than her expected loss1.
4 MOTIVATING EXAMPLE
Consider a scenario with a single insurable loss with value $1,000:
for example, consider insuring a car against total loss. There are
1,000 possible policy-holders: 500 of them have a 2% chance of
su￿ering the loss (low risk) and 500 have a 2.5% chance of su￿ering
the loss (high risk).
Table 1 describes this scenario with expected-value premiums as
assumed in much of the insurance literature. The ￿rst row describes
the premiums collected if low risk and high risk individuals are
in separate insurance pools, potentially at di￿erent companies.
The second and third rows consider two di￿erent ways of pricing
premiumswhen all of the individuals are in the same insurance pool.
1One clarifying point: it is important to distinguish between the reduction in variance
a policyholder purchases when she buys insurance and the reduction in variance that
occurs in an insurance pool when more people are added. The ￿rst case is a motivating
reason why people purchase insurance, but the second case is a reason why larger
insurance pools are helpful (and is a major focus of this paper).
Note that the total amount of premiums stays the same in all three
situations, which is a feature of the expected value pricing scheme.
The second row has even-split pricing, which might be consider
solidaristic. Note that the low risk policy-holders pay strictly more
and the high risk policy-holders pay strictly less than if they were
in separate insurance pools: this is a necessary property of any
solidaristic pricing scheme with this model. The third row describes
proportional pricing, which might be viewed as an actuarially-fair
pricing scheme. Note that both types of policy-holders pay amounts
proportional to their risk: in this case, they neither bene￿t nor are
hurt from being in an insurance pool together.
Next, Table 2 analyzes the same scenario, but under the insolvency-
based premium calculation with externalities of size as discussed
previously. This example uses 1? = 2 to give a 2.27% chance of
insolvency. Note that the total cost of insuring all of the individuals
is lower when they are pooled together, as opposed to being in
separate homogeneous pools. The second row re￿ects equal pric-
ing: both low and high risk policy-holders see their costs decrease!
From the perspective of the low risk policyholders, the decrease in
overall costs due to externalities of size outweighs the costs of pool-
ing with a higher risk group. The last row contains the values for
proportional pricing, which shows that both types of policy-holders
see strictly lower costs than they would get alone. Later sections
will describe exactly how proportional pricing is calculated in this
model, and will also demonstrate that there always exist pricing
schemes where both low and high risk policyholders strictly bene￿t
from being pooled together, regardless of their risk levels.
Finally, Table 3 also shows an example of insolvency-based pre-
mium calculation, but when high risk players are even riskier: they
each have a 4% chance of a loss. As expected, the total amount
of money that needs to be collected in premiums is higher. Here,
even-split pricing still lowers the high-risk policyholder’s price, but
it increases the low risk policyholder’s price compared to being in
a separate insurance pool. Surprisingly, under proportional pricing
the low risk policyholders pays less than when did when the low
risk policyholder’s risk was lower, at 2.5%. Later results will show
that this kind of anti-social incentive for other policyholders to
have higher risks is a necessary feature of pricing policies like this.
5 MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
5.1 Model and terminology
Insurancemodel: We consider the case where there are two types
of people, low risk or high risk. There are a total of #! low risk
players and #  high risk players. Each person is considering pur-
chasing insurance that would cover them completely in case of a
speci￿c loss of value + , where such a loss can happen either zero
times or once during the insurance time period. The low risk policy-
holder has probability A! of su￿ering such a loss, while the high risk
policyholders has probability A  : such probabilities are perfectly
known to all participants, as well as the insurance companies. We
will assume that A! < A  < 0.5, that all losses occur independently
of each other, and that the insurance pool is using insolvency-based
premium calculation.
General model (beyond insurance): We again assume there are
two types of people, each with a low or high cost associated: A! 2
R 0, A  2 R 0. The total cost generated by a set of =! low risk
189

players and=  high risk players is6({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }). The cost is
monotone and high risk players aremore costly: for any=!,=  , A!, A  ,
the increase in 6(·) from adding a single low risk player is strictly
lower than the increase in 6(·) from adding a single high risk player.
We will assume the function is strictly submodular in =!,=  ,
as in Lemma 1, and also that it is continuous in A! 2 [0,1), A  2
[0,1). Additionally, we will assume that a player with 0 cost con-
tributes nothing to the total cost, implying that6({=!,=  }, {0, 0}) =
0: a pool whose members have 0 cost produces 0 total cost.
Terminology:We will often refer to the participants in the pooled
activity as players, agents, or policyholders. Sometimes we will
refer to the groups they form as pools or coalitions. A collection
of coalitions is a coalition structure. A coalition structure is core-
stable if there does not exist a group of player ( so that each player
would strictly prefer to be in ( as opposed to being in their present
pool. We will sometimes use the notation c (=!,=  ) to refer to a
coalition with =! low risk players and =  high risk players. The
pool containing all of the players will be called the “grand coalition”
and can also be written c (#!,#  ). We will use 5! (·), 5  (·) to refer
to the prices charged to low and high risk players respectively.
5.2 Technical assumptions
One common assumption in arguments about insurance is moral
hazard, which relates to the incentives people have to change their
risks (or costs, in the general model). By this argument, charging
a high-risk individual more will incentivize them to reduce their
risks: failing to charge them more would incentivize riskier be-
havior. This increased cost is then passed on to the entire pool. In
this paper, we do not assume that the premium an individual is
charged in￿uences their risk level. This is not just an assumption of
convenience, but is motivated by consideration of what we should
consider “voluntary”. Some actions that could reduce risk of a loss
could be extremely costly — and some people will be better posi-
tioned to incur these costs than others. For example, supplemental
driving lessons, beyond those required by the state, likely reduce
the risk of an accident, but they impose additional costs on drivers
that not everyone will be able to incur. Within this paper, we are
assuming that an individual’s risk is either immutable or that the
cost of changing the risk is prohibitively expensive.
We will also assume that pricing must be e￿cient: the total
amount paid by all members in a pool must sum up to the total
amount required as calculated by the cost function. There are situ-
ations where this might not be true, where there are savings, for
example. However, omitting the e￿ciency assumption makes it
very hard to say anything technical: when the price can be com-
pletely unrelated to the cost needed, it is not possible to guarantee
anything about the prices. We will also assume that prices can
depend only on the risk of the individual, which implies that all
individuals with the same risk must have the same price.
5.3 Normative assumptions
In this work, we necessarily make a number of normative assump-
tions alongside our technical assumptions [8]. We focus our atten-
tion on insurance products that provide value to policyholders and
to the world (excluding insurance of harmful or objectionable activ-
ities). We will assume that being denied insurance has a negative
impact on their life, either through direct loss of insurance or loss
of essential goods a￿orded by insurance. For example, someone
denied home-owners insurance loses both the insurance as well as
potentially the ability to get a mortgage [12]. As mentioned earlier,
we explicitly do not analyze health insurance, which is so essential
to well-being that many societies treat it as a right.
We thus subscribe to the normative belief that a pricing scheme
that induces participation in the insurance market is preferable to
other arrangements in which agents might have rational incentives
to opt out completely. We further assume that arrangements that
maximize welfare (by reducing overall costs while providing the
same level of value to policyholders) are normatively preferable
to others: in particular, this means that we prefer cases where all
policyholders are in the same insurance pool (the grand coalition),
when possible. And we take as a given, for reasons described earlier,
the desirability of an arrangement that maximally subsidizes high-
risk agents, while ensuring the stability of the grand coalition, as
this serves the twin normative goals of reducing inequality and
obtaining the collective welfare gains from economies of size. While
individual insurers might be motivated to adopt such a scheme with
pro￿t-maximization in mind (because such a scheme would help
ensure that agents are not convinced to join an insurance pool run
by a competitor), this is not our primary concern.
We also note that setting premiums is only one of many possible
mechanisms that could be used to achieve policy goals. For example,
even if our analysis says that a certain pricing scheme is “infeasible,”
it could still be the case that, for example, tax subsidies and redis-
tribution could achieve an equivalent result. In fact, our analysis
will reveal when it is necessary to consider such alternatives.
6 SOLIDARITY UNDER EXTERNALITIES OF
SIZE
So far, we have introduced a model for calculating the total costs
created by a group of individuals. Here, we take a solidaristic per-
spective in how we might divide this cost.
The ￿rst section implements “even split” pricing, where both
players pay the same amount. This approach most closely matches
what advocates of solidarity might suggest. Interestingly, we show
that sometimes even-split pricing can strictly bene￿t both the low
risk and high risk players ￿nancially. However, there are also situa-
tions where even-split pricing is too aggressive and ends up hurting
both the low risk and high risk players.
Next, the second section explores a more ￿exible notion of fair-
ness: one where we minimize the cost paid by the more expensive
high risk participants, while maintaining stability. This pricing
scheme might be useful in cases where we wish to ￿nancially sup-
port high risk players as much as we can without causing low risk
players to wish to defect. Finally, the last section applies these re-
sults speci￿cally to the insurance premium case and discusses the
implications for the fairness debate.
6.1 Even-split price
Consider the even-split pricing scheme de￿ned below.
De￿nition 1. With even-split pricing, both the high and low risk
participants pay the same amount: 6 ( {=!,=  },{A!,A  })
=!+=  .
190
How Externalities of Size Complicate Notions of Solidarity and Actuarial Fairness FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
As mentioned before, this pricing scheme follows a natural phi-
losophy of solidarity: all participants should pay the same amount.
For a cost function 6(·) that is linear, as is assumed in much of the
literature on insurance, such a pricing scheme must strictly hurt the
low risk players and strictly help the high risk players. For a sub-
modular cost function, the result is more complicated. The lemma
below describes a situation where even-split pricing makes the
grand coalition core-stable: that is, no subgroup of players wishes
to deviate and form their own pool.
Lemma 2. With even-split pricing, if the below inequality is satis￿ed,
then the grand coalition (c (#!,#  )) is core-stable.
6({#!,#  }, {A!, A  })
#! + # 
<
6({#!, 0}, {A!, 0})
#!
The proof is presented in Appendix A.
It is worth pausing to realize why Lemma 2 is useful. The in-
equality states the grand coalition is stable against the deviation
where all the low risk players form their own group in c (#!, 0). The
lemma tells us that the inequality implies that something stronger:
that the grand coalition is stable against deviations from every other
possible combination of low risk and high risk players c (=!,=  ).
Overall, this result suggests that there exist situations where both
the low risk players and the high risk players bene￿t ￿nancially
from solidarity as implemented in even-split pricing. To understand
why this happen, it helps to think of there being two countervailing
forces: one is that each additional person increases total costs, but
the other is that, through submodularity, they may produce cost
savings. When the cost savings outweigh the cost increases, it may
be possible for both groups to bene￿t from even-split pricing.
However, this is not always the case. Corollary 1 states a more
pessimistic implication: there exist cases where even-split pricing
￿nancially hurts the high risk participants that it aims to help.
Corollary 1. If the inequality in Lemma 2 does not hold, then the
grand coalition will not be stable: the low risk players have an incentive
to defect to c (#!, 0), where they will pay a lower amount.
The corollary implies that if even-split pricing is implemented
in this situation, the low risk players will leave the grand coalition,
leaving the high risk players in the coalition c (0,#  ) and paying a
price 6 ( {0,#  },{0,A  })
# 
. In this way, attempting to enforce solidarity
can make both groups worse o￿.
This result matches the intuition developed from other analysis.
For example, Akerlof [1] describes how information asymmetry
could cause a market to fall apart, even when there were willing
sellers and buyers. Here, even-split pricing mimics information
asymmetry because it is impossible to distinguish between the
low risk and high risk participants. The grand coalition pool falls
apart even though it is possible to produce a pricing scheme where
both low risk and high risk players bene￿t from being combined.
Similarly, this result matches the analysis in works like Kasy and
Abebe [17]which demonstrated that, in certain situations, enforcing
fairness can reduce welfare for both groups.
6.2 Max-subsidy
In this section, we explore the following pricing scheme that aims
to help subsidize high risk player’s price as much as possible, while
still ensuring low risk players have an incentive to participate in
the grand coalition. As mentioned before, this is a more ￿exible
notion of solidarity than even-split pricing: we will explore it as
a complement to the results we derived there. First, we de￿ne the
pricing scheme.
De￿nition 2. Max-subsidy pricing follows this pricing policy:
5! ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) = 6({=!, 0}, {A!, 0})
=!
5  ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) = 6({=!,=  }, {A!, A  })   6({=!, 0}, {A!, 0})
= 
First, we will show that with this pricing scheme, high risk play-
ers most prefer being in the grand coalition, while low risk players
most prefer being with as many other low risk players as possible
(and do not care about the presence of high risk players). The proof
is given in Appendix A. The corollary shows that this implies that
the grand coalition is core-stable.
Lemma 3. For max-subsidy pricing, 5! (·) is decreasing in =! and
constant in =  , 5  (·) is decreasing in both =! and =  .
Corollary 2. Assume a submodular cost function 6(·) with max-
subsidy pricing. The “grand coalition” where all players are in the
same insurance pool is core-stable.
P￿￿￿￿. Showing that the grand coalition is core-stable means
that there does not exist a group of players ( whose members all
strictly prefer being together to being in the grand coalition. Any
low risk player is indi￿erent between any arrangement that has
=! low risk players and pays higher cost in any coalition with
=0! < =! , so there is no set ( where the low risk players get strictly
lower price. High risk players most prefer being with more low
risk players and high risk players, so being in the grand coalition is
their optimal arrangement. ⇤
Next, we investigate the “max” part of max-subsidy pricing: we
show that any pricing scheme where the high risk players pay
less than max-subsidy is one where the low risk players have an
incentive to defect.
Lemma 4. Assume a submodular cost function 6(·). Then, any pric-
ing scheme where the high risk players pay less than max-subsidy (for
any given coalition) is one where the low risk players have a group
incentive to defect to a homogeneous pool of only low risk players.
P￿￿￿￿. Suppose that the high risk players pay n > 0 less than the
5  (·) max-subsidy price described above. Then, the total amount
that the high risk players pay is:
6({=0!,=
0
  }, {A!, A  })   6({=0!, 0}, {A!, 0})   n · =0 
By e￿ciency, this means that the low risk players must pay:
6({=0!, 0}, {A!, 0})
=0!
+ n ·
=0 
=0!
which is strictly greater than what they would pay in a group of
=0! low risk players alone, so they have an incentive to defect. ⇤
191
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Donahue and Barocas
This result shows that max-subsidy is the best we can do: it
provides a tight lower bound on howmuch it is possible to subsidize
the high risk group without destabilizing the pool. Bounds like
this may be helpful for framing the scope of options available for
subsidizing a certain group through market mechanisms, though it
may be possible to provide stronger subsidizes through non-market
mechanisms such as direct tax and subsidies.
6.3 Implication for insurance application
In the previous sections, we have shown results for a general cost
function 6(·). In this section, we will translate these results into the
insolvency-based pricing scheme. For conciseness, we will de￿ne
'! = A! · (1   A!) and '  = A  · (1   A  ).
Applying the results of Lemma 2 tells us that an equal split
pricing scheme is possible whenever:
+ ·
 
#! · A! + #  · A  + 1? · p#! · '! + #  · ' 
 
#! + # 

+ ·
 
A! · #! + 1? · p#! · '!
 
#!
Applying the results of Lemma 3 tells us that the max-subsidy
pricing scheme in the insurance case is:
5! ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) = +
✓
A! + 1? ·
p
'!p
=!
◆
5  ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) = +
✓
A  + 1?
p
=!'! + = '    p
=!'!
= 
◆
Next, we consider the potential implications of these results on
debates around fairness in insurance. As mentioned before, it is
important to note that there are two countervailing forces at work:
one is the additional costs that each person potentially brings to
the pool; the other is the cost-savings that the collective enjoys
by enlarging the pool and thereby reducing variance. This creates
interesting dynamics: essentially, the submodularity of the cost
function 6(·) produces extra “wiggle room.” In some cases, the
bene￿ts of increasing the size of the pool can swamp out the cost of
including riskier participants. Under these circumstances, low-risk
people are willing to let high-risk people join the pool — or are
willing to remain in the pool if high-risk people join — if doing so
results in lower prices for them, even if everyone is charged the
same price. In particular, it seems that the case where solidarity
might be easiest to achieve is where A  is not much larger than
A! and #  is much larger than #! . To put it simply, size ensures
solidarity: the fact that the high-risk group is large enables the
even sharing of costs. This runs counter to expectations because
it might be reasonable to assume that a coalition needs solidarity
— a willingness to join together, even if it’s not utility-maximizing
for some — to build a large coalition. However, the results indicate
that the motivation works the other way around.
There are, of course, limits to how much insurers can save in
costs by reducing variance and how much these savings can com-
pensate for the di￿erence in risks between groups. In fact, our
model gives a precise account for how far we can pursue solidaris-
tic goals before the pool begins to destabilize — and thus when
non-market mechanisms might be necessary to achieve those goals,
such as taxation and redistribution policies. Our ￿ndings further
demonstrate that imposing an even-split pricing scheme on the be-
lief that it serves the goals of solidarity can have the opposite e￿ect
by discouraging people from remaining in the pool and actually
drive up costs for all the remaining members, including the most
price-sensitive. From this perspective, charging di￿erent prices —
something that actuarial fairness demands — can have the e￿ect of
ensuring a greater willingness on the part of policyholders to stay
in the pool — that is, to be in solidarity with others and thus collec-
tively enjoy the bene￿ts of variance reduction. It is worth noting
that in both cases, we analyzed the stability given that all insurers in
a market follow the the same pricing rule. This situation might occur
in the even-split case if rules are mandated by the government that
forbid price discrimination on certain characteristics [3].
In this way, the results of this analysis can be helpful as a guide-
post for debates around solidarity, explaining when it may be possi-
ble to achieve solidaristic goals while still ensuring a stable pricing
scheme and when di￿erential pricing can nevertheless serve sol-
idaristic ends. In the next section, we will implement a similar
analysis for actuarial fairness.
7 ACTUARIAL FAIRNESS UNDER
EXTERNALITIES OF SIZE
In the previous section, we described pricing schemes whose goal
was to minimize the cost paid by high risk individuals—a solidaristic
goal. In this section, we will explore pricing schemes related to the
actuarial fairness literature. As a reminder, common themes within
this literature revolve around the desire for individuals to pay “their
share” of what they contribute to overall costs.
In the ￿rst subsection, we describe a few pricing schemes that
might attempt to satisfy certain properties of actuarial fairness.
However, these pricing schemes produce certain anti-social in-
centives for participants. In the next subsection, we explore two
impossibility results indicating that these undesirable properties
are actually necessary, if we wish to have other properties like
e￿ciency. Finally, the last subsection considers the implications of
these results in our insurance application.
7.1 Pricing schemes for insurance application
In this subsection, we describe two di￿erent pricing schemes that
might attempt to satisfy actuarial fairness properties. However, we
also note that they have some undesirable properties.
Onewell-knownway of dividing costs is according to the Shapley
value [23]. For a cost-sharing game with = participants and cost
function 6(·), the Shapley value would assign a cost to player 8
according to:
q (8) = 1
=
’
( 2 [=]\{8 }
6(( [ {8})   6(() = 1
|( |
 
which can be interpreted as the average increase in cost player 8
brings to a pool, where the average is taken over all possible pools
of participants. It has been proven that the Shapley value is core-
stable whenever the cost function is submodular [7, 23], meaning
that a pricing policy following the Shapley value is one where no
subgroup is incentivized to leave the grand coalition.
192
How Externalities of Size Complicate Notions of Solidarity and Actuarial Fairness FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
One drawback of the Shapley value is that it is computationally
ine￿cient for large =, given that computing its value requires sum-
ming over all possible subsets of players. In this paper, we will use
a related, but di￿erent pricing scheme we call proportional pricing.
With this pricing:
5! ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) = + ·
✓
A! + 1?
A!p
'! · =! + '  · = 
◆
5  ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) = + ·
✓
A  + 1?
A p
'! · =! + '  · = 
◆
It is straightforward to check that this satis￿es e￿ciency. Note
that this pricing scheme also has the property that adding another
participant strictly reduces the premium any individual pays: for
this reason, the grand coalition will minimize costs for both low
risk and high risk players, which implies it is core-stable.
However, this pricing scheme also has two other properties that
may be undesirable. First, the price low risk players pay depends on
the number and riskiness of the high risk players (and vice versa).
This may be undesirable because, by the conception of actuarial
fairness, a premium should depend solely on the risk that individ-
ual is responsible for. With the insolvency-based pricing, such a
property no longer seems reasonable to aim for. In the next section,
we show that, given some reasonable assumptions, it is impossible
for a strictly submodular cost function 6(·) to give rise to a pric-
ing scheme where players pay prices that are independent of the
risks of other participants. It may be useful to note some irony in
these results: to keep people from defecting from the insurance
pool, which is the goal of actuarial fairness, the insurer needs to
set individual premiums in a way that depends on the presence of
other people in the pool, exactly what actuarial fairness forbids.
Secondly, the proportional pricing scheme above has the prop-
erty that players prefer that their partners are more risky: for ex-
ample, 5! (·) strictly decreases as A  increases. This produces the
anti-social incentive to wish that the risk of other participants
increases. Again, in the next section we show that such a prop-
erty is also a necessary feature of a stable pricing scheme with a
submodular pricing function.
7.2 Impossibility results
First, we will show that it is impossible to have prices that are
completely independent of the risk of other participants.
Lemma 5. The following three qualities cannot be achieved simul-
taneously:
(1) E￿ciency: 6(·) = =! · 5! (·) + =  · 5  (·)
(2) 5! ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) is independent of A  ,=  .
(3) 5  ({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) is independent of A!,=! .
P￿￿￿￿. In proving this, we will assume that the second and third
properties hold, and use it to show a violation of e￿ciency. For
conciseness, we will drop the number of players =!,=  , which
are held constant in the equations, so that 6({=!,=  }, {A!, A  }) =
6(A!, A  ).
First, we consider a case where the high-risk player’s cost is 0.
By e￿ciency, we must have:
=! · 5! (A!, 0) + =  · 5  (A!, 0) = 6(A!, 0)
By property 2, 5  (A!, 0) = 5  (0, 0), so the equation can be rewritten
as:
=! · 5! (A!, 0) = 6(A!, 0)   =  · 5  (0, 0)
Similarly, considering the case where the low risk player’s cost is 0
gives the equation:
=  · 5  (0, A  ) = 6(0, A  )   =  · 5! (0, 0)
We can then consider the case where both players have nonzero
cost: we will show a violation of e￿ciency. The total amount that
the players pay is
=! · 5! (A!, A  ) + =  · 5  (A!, A  )
By properties 2 and 3 and previous equations:
=! · 5! (A!, A  ) = =! · 5! (A!, 0) = 6(A!, 0)   =  · 5  (0, 0)
Similarly:
=  · 5! (A!, A  ) = =  · 5! (0, A  ) = 6(0, A  )   =! · 5! (0, 0)
We can use this to rewrite the equation as:
=! · 5! (A!, A  ) + =  · 5  (A!, A  )
= 6(A!, 0)   =  · 5  (0, 0) + 6(0, A  )   =! · 5! (0, 0)
We can drop some terms by considering the case where both players
have 0 cost:
=! · 5! (0, 0) + =  · 5  (0, 0) = 6(0, 0) = 0
which simpli￿es the sum down to 6(A!, 0) + 6(0, A  ). In order for
e￿ciency to hold, this implies that we must have:
6(A!, 0) + 6(0, A  ) = 6(A!, A  )
As a reminder, 6(A!, 0) is independent of =  . The last equation is
saying that the cost associated with =! low risk individuals plus
the cost associated with =  high risk individuals is equal to the
cost associated with =! low risk individuals combined with = 
high risk individuals — which violates the fact that 6(·) is strictly
submodular. ⇤
Next, we will show that there must exist some anti-social incen-
tives: for example, any pricing scheme where 5! (·) is increasing
with A  on some interval [0, A 0  ] is also one where players have an
incentive to defect.
Lemma 6. Assume that:
lim
A !0
[5  (A!, A  )] = 2
for some constant 2 . Then, it is not possible to have a pricing scheme
that satis￿es all three of the following properties:
(1) E￿ciency: 6(·) = =! · 5! (·) + =  · 5  (·)
(2) Aligned incentives: low risk players prefer that high risk players
have lower risks on some interval including 0.
3
3A 
5! (A!, A  ) > 0 8A  2 [0, A ]
(3) Stability: for every level of risk A!, A  , both low risk players and
high risk players bene￿t by being pooled together.
Property 2 is stated from the perspective of the low risk player, but the
same logic (in the statement and proof) would work if it were stated
from the perspective of the high risk player.
193
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Donahue and Barocas
Note that Lemma 6 does not exclude the case where the low risk
player’s cost might stay constant as A  increases. However, Lemma
5 shows that the low and high risk players cannot both have prices
independent of each other’s risk.
P￿￿￿￿. For conciseness, we will again drop the number of play-
ers =!,=  , which are held constant in the equations. For this proof,
we assume that the ￿rst and second properties hold and use it to
show that the third property cannot hold. First, we consider the
case where 2  0. We start with property 1 (e￿ciency):
6(A!, A  ) = =! · 5! (A!, A  ) + =  · 5  (A!, A  )
Next, we take the limit as A  ! 0 on both sides, which gives:
6(A!, 0) = =! · lim
A !0
[5! (A!, A  )] + =  · 2
Rearranging gives:
lim
A !0
[5! (A!, A  )] = 6(A!, 0)
=!
  = 
=!
2
So, as A  decreases towards 0, the price low risk players pay goes
to something equal to or greater than
6(A!, 0)
=!
=
6({=!, 0}, {A!, 0})
=!
which is the price they would pay in a group of only low risk players.
Because of property 2, we know that 5! (·) is decreasing as A  is
decreasing, so 5! () is strictly greater than the price the low risk
players would pay if they were alone. This proves the statement in
the case that 2  0.
Next, we consider the case where 2 > 0. In this case, we’ll show
that the high risk player has an incentive to defect. By assumption,
lim
A !0
[5  (A!, A  )] = 2 > 0
However, we also have that:
lim
A !0
[5  (0, A  )] = 0
So for some A  > 0, 5  (·) is greater than the price it would get in
a homogeneous group with only high risk players. Taken together,
these cases prove the lemma. ⇤
7.3 Implication for insurance application
Finally, we will consider the implications of these results. First,
these results tell us that independence is not the key to stability, as
the arguments in favor of actuarial fairness would have us believe.
In fact, allowing the premiums charged to one individual to be
a￿ected by the presence or absence of other people is how we are
able to ensure a stable pool. A truly independent pricing scheme
would over-charge participants, which would be ine￿cient. With
a submodular cost function, however, prices are being helpfully
a￿ected by the reduction in variance that occurs from a larger pool.
Secondly, these results show that actuarial fairness misaligns
incentives. Participants in the pool are incentivized to reduce their
own risk — but they are also incentivized to wish other members
of the pool have higher risk, which is not socially optimal. This
could be seen as moral hazard, but one degree removed: wishing
that other people would take on greater risk because it bene￿ts you
￿nancially.
These results reveal the need to revisit the conceptual founda-
tions of actuarial fairness in light of externalities of size, especially
given that one of the main goals of actuarial fairness is to maintain
a large pool of diversi￿ed risks — the very thing that produces these
externalities.
8 CONCLUSION
There are a few high-level results that are useful to take away from
this work. Overall, a cost-sharing game with externalities of size is
one where solidarity and actuarial fairness are not straightforward.
The cost savings associatedwith larger groups can enable prices that
strictly bene￿t both low and high cost individuals. More strongly
than that, we give bounds on the lowest stable price we can give
to the high cost group, as well as conditions for when even-split
pricing is stable. Actuarial fairness also becomes more nuanced:
the notions of independence and e￿ciency of pricing turn out to
be at odds with each other. Additionally, requiring e￿ciency and
stability actually produces its own kind of moral hazard.
Our ￿ndings have broader implications for the FAccT community
and for those concerned with issues of fairness in insurance. Our
study highlights an important dynamic that has been overlooked
in the FAccT literature: how we decide to treat one individual often
depends on how we have decided to treat others, which is true in
cases even beyond traditional ones like scarce resource allocation.
This paper has focused on insurance, where the decision to o￿er
insurance to one person at some price a￿ects the terms on which
we are able to o￿er insurance to others, but other domains exhibit
similar properties. Existing work on fairness in machine learning
has also not yet explored the value of economies of size and how
theymight ease the challenge of achieving certain equality-oriented
notions of fairness. Economies of size help to align the interests
of low-risk and high-risk populations and give us more room to
maneuver when setting stable solidaristic pricing schemes. But
they can also be of value in such domains as credit, where pooling
default risk should have similar e￿ects on the interest rates that
lenders charge debtors.
More broadly, our results challenge common beliefs in insurance.
We show that the stark distinction that people like to draw between
solidarity and actuarial fairness in insurance falls apart upon closer
examination, largely because people have failed to recognize what
can be achieved with variance reduction. This ￿nding calls for more
￿exible notions of fairness that are able to take into account dynam-
ics produced by di￿erent cost functions — including externalities
of size, but also other variants on the cost function beyond what
we have proposed in this paper.
