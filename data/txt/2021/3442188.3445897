ABSTRACT
As machine learning and data science applications grow ever more
prevalent, there is an increased focus on data sharing and open
data initiatives, particularly in the context of the African continent.
Many argue that data sharing can support research and policy de-
sign to alleviate poverty, inequality, and derivative effects in Africa.
Despite the fact that the datasets in question are often extracted
from African communities, conversations around the challenges
of accessing and sharing African data are too often driven by non-
African stakeholders. These perspectives frequently employ a deficit
narratives, often focusing on lack of education, training, and tech-
nological resources in the continent as the leading causes of friction
in the data ecosystem.
We argue that these narratives obfuscate and distort the full
complexity of the African data sharing landscape. In particular, we
use storytelling via fictional personas built from a series of inter-
views with African data experts to complicate dominant narratives
and to provide counternarratives. Coupling these personas with
research on data practices within the continent, we identify recur-
ring barriers to data sharing as well as inequities in the distribution
of data sharing benefits. In particular, we discuss issues arising
from power imbalances resulting from the legacies of colonialism,
ethno-centrism, and slavery, disinvestment in building trust, lack
of acknowledgement of historical and present-day extractive prac-
tices, and Western-centric policies that are ill-suited to the African
context. After outlining these problems, we discuss avenues for
addressing them when sharing data generated in the continent.

1 INTRODUCTION
Data sharing is often regarded as a crucial element of research and
scientific advancements, a hallmark of transparency, and a key to
economic growth [14, 21, 26]. Data sharing expands knowledge and
contributes to a better science [32, 68, 106]. Recent years have seen
increased global momentum for improving data sharing and, in
some cases, a push for open data and lowered barries to data access
[8, 25, 88, 95, 100, 128].1 However, concerns such as privacy, intel-
lectual property rights, organizational and structural challenges,
cultural and social contexts, unjust historical pasts, and potential
harms to marginalized communities all make improving data access
a highly complex and at times contentious issue [8, 28, 60, 71].
Data sharing challenges are further exacerbated in the African
context: Historical and present-day colonial-era practices and ide-
ologies force us to confront a reality characterized by data colonial-
ism [29, 36, 79, 115]. Countless data sharing initiatives as well as
a growing enthusiasm for data sharing movements can be found
throughout the 54 distinct nations in the continent [14, 21, 32, 116].
At the same time, various obstacles limit equitable data sharing
practices; entire heterogeneous geographies of people have their
data accessed and shared, yet do not reap the same benefits as the
data collectors and owners of data infrastructures [40, 87]. These
communities can face harm as a result of their data being accessed,
shared, and used [84, 93]. At its core, various structural and rela-
tional challenges plague the relationships between entities based
outside of the continent and the African communities whose data
is being accessed. The continent’s plural and at times divergent
norms, practices, and traditions furthermore complicate the African
data access and sharing ecosystem. In sum, data sharing in Africa
poses a unique set of challenges that remain understudied.
The African data sharing ecosystem involves numerous stake-
holders, including communities, companies, government bodies,
1While data sharing often focuses on facilitating ease of data transfers between indi-
vidual scientists, institutes, and/or organizations, truly open data goes beyond that
by making data ‘freely’ available for use to a wider-range of populations, rendering it
a public good. In this work, we primarily focus on data sharing practices, although
many of the insights we draw also apply to arguments for opening data.

policymakers, non-government organizations (NGOs), data col-
lectors, data labellers, data brokers, data subjects, archivists, re-
searchers, and many others [4, 85, 87, 114]. Responsible data shar-
ing requires a harmonious partnership between all stakeholders,
both under and on top of the iceberg, as depicted in Figure 1. Con-
sideration of the interests, values, and needs of all — and especially
those whose data is being collected — is a vital step in fostering
responsible data sharing practices. In many cases, however, we
find that more powerful stakeholders wield disproportionate power
in driving the design, framing, and enforcement of data sharing
policies and practices; their values and interests dictate not only
the data sharing landscape, but also narratives around data access.
On the other hand, data sharing in the continent relies heavily on
those in the hidden part of the iceberg. Data is often extracted from
these same communities, and analyses of the data often have a direct
impact on them. Given the significant role of power asymmetries
between these groups, data sharing policies and practices that do
not acknowledge such imbalances will fail to capture all relevant
perspectives. In this work, we examine this dynamic data sharing
landscape, its possible benefits and harms, and challenges around
data practices. Our work focuses on the following questions: Who
benefits from data sharing in Africa? What barriers exist in the data
sharing ecosystem, and for whom? How do entrenched legacies
of power disparity, colonialisms, ethno-centricisms, slavery, and
Anglo- and Euro-centrism present challenges in the data sharing
ecosystem? If much of the data sharing practice and initiative is
shaped from the perspective of the Global North, how then can we
ensure that the narrative for Africa is controlled by Africans? We
tackle these questions guided by the experiences and perspectives
of African communities and initiatives, and especially those in the
hidden part of the iceberg.
Dominant narratives around data sharing in Africa often focus
on a lack of knowledge about the value of data and training, as
well as insufficient technological resources. This is often followed
by deficit narratives,2 where discussions regarding data sharing
in Africa revolve around issues of hunger, illiteracy, unemploy-
ment, and poverty. In anchoring narratives around these concerns
— which are not unique to Africa and do not capture the full scope
of its people’s experiences — the strength, agency, and scientific and
cultural contributions of communities within the continent are min-
imized. Community norms, values, and traditions are overlooked,
and policies and practice around improving data sharing focus on
“fixing” the continent’s problems. The perception of the dominant
(often Western) narratives as the standard comes at the expense of
discarding local knowledge and expertise. Furthermore, data shar-
ing issues are discussed as a Global North/Global South concern,
ignoring plural norms, practices, and traditions that exist within
the continent, which themselves demand a thorough examination.
As we navigate this data sharing landscape, we counter these
deficit narratives and clichéd stereotypes with which the African
continent is frequently portrayed. In doing so, we hope to high-
light overlooked imbalances, inequalities, and injustices in the data
sharing ecosystem, and to support the development of policies and
programs that will illuminate and mitigate them. We counter these
narratives through storytelling. We construct fictional personas
based on semi-structured interviews with data experts from the
continent, as well as our collective expertise in collecting, accessing,
and sharing data within the continent. Through these personas, we
highlight challenges faced by African communities in accessing
and sharing data, as well as the strategies they employ to insist on
community-affirming data practices.
The stories also examine the power structures that affect if and
how a community benefits from transactions involving the use of
their data. By using these personas as touchpoints, we find that
three overarching challenges — power imbalances among stake-
holders, disinvestment on building trust, and disregard for context
and local knowledge — drive inequalities and injustices in the data
sharing ecosystem. Through an analysis of these failures, we ar-
gue that the policy and practice of data access and sharing must
centre the needs of those stakeholders in the hidden part of the
iceberg. The values and expertise of communities whose data is
being collected and shared need to take precedence in the develop-
ment of data governance standards. Through our discussions, we
advocate for policies and practices that acknowledge and aim to
counter power asymmetries and structural obstacles. In presenting
our arguments, we also bring to the forefront rich research and
scholarship on this topic by African scholars.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATEDWORK
Data sharing and open data movements are gaining momentum
globally [26, 32, 64, 100], including in the context of the African con-
tinent [13, 25, 34, 34]. Some of this push within the continent comes
from funding agencies and government requests for researchers to

archive and share data, including open data portals from countries
such as Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa [2, 23, 42, 53]. The
call for data sharing is found in various researching fields across the
continent, including in the environmental, geospatial, agriculture,
health, and biomedical sciences [18, 40, 105, 107]. The intergovern-
mental Group on Earth Observations (GEO) [9], for example, runs
initiatives focused on Africa (AfriGEOSS) with the aim of enhancing
earth observation data production, management, and sharing. Sim-
ilarly, the digitization and sharing of soil data are believed to play
a crucial role in a number of fields, including food security, health,
hydrological modelling, and climate change [48, 57, 118, 121]. Cit-
ing dialogues during a South African Soil Information Workshop,
scholars identify the expansion of soil databases and data sharing as
important developments for soil science and environmental fields
[22, 101]. The biomedical sciences also echo the call for data sharing
[3, 27, 40, 50, 86]. In a recent paper, Martin et al. [72] have called
for global genomic data sharing and discussed the urgent need for
more genetic data studies, while also arguing that African popula-
tions are not represented in global genomic databases. Although
the authors raise crucial concerns, including the unsuitability of the
“European method” to study heterogeneous African populations,
they contend that data sharing is vital for a fair representation.
One of the strongest arguments for rethinking how data is shared
comes from the Academy of Science of South Africa, which cre-
ated the African Open Science Platform, a project led by the South
African Department of Science and Technology [96]. This project
emphasizes the need to increase awareness, accessibility, and visi-
bility of African science and data. It calls for data and science to be
as open as possible, with the aim of stimulating interdisciplinary
use of data, identifying research areas for further exploration, and
averting the duplication of research.
The questions of data sharing and management are becoming
ever more pertinent to the continent. In one of the key gather-
ings in 2018, various stakeholders and government officials from
Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, South Africa, and Uganda
discussed and formulated national policies [122]. With increased
demand for statistical data across many African countries, many
data organisations have been established to promote data accessi-
bility and open data [8, 24, 34, 100, 128]. For instance, the African
Development Bank Group developed a statistical open data portal
known as Africa Information Highway (AIH) portal [46]. AIH links
all African countries with the aim of increasing public access to
statistics across the continent, while also helping these countries
improve data management, data quality, and sharing/dissemination.
Similarly, Kenya Open Data [86] is a portal that provides public ac-
cess to several governmental datasets curated in different categories
at no cost. This platform aims to support the government’s com-
mitment to transparency and data sharing between government
offices and various stakeholders.
Despite extensive calls for data sharing and open data, backed
by various initiatives and organizations, data access remains rela-
tively limited within the continent [34, 43, 113, 119]. Bangani and
Moyo [18], for example, compare data sharing practices among re-
searchers in South Africa to researchers in countries such as France,
the United Kingdom, and Turkey. The authors state that most re-
searchers in South Africa are not interested in sharing their data and
prefer to use data generated by others; only 19.4% of South African
researchers indicated that they currently share their research data
with others. As reasons for their reluctance, these South African
researchers cited worries ranging from unethical use or misuse to
lack of resources. In extended fieldwork with biochemistry labora-
tories in sub-Saharan Africa, Bezuidenhout and Rappert [28] find
that scientists opt for closure over openness with regard to their
data. The reasons put forward include inequalities in research envi-
ronments which, if not examined critically, perpetuate disparities.
Furthermore, an overwhelming number of researchers in Africa
lack the funding necessary to make their data open to the wider
community [26]. Bezuidenhout and Chakauya [26] reporte a lack
of financial investment in physical infrastructures could make a
researcher’s data unavailable, especially for critical clinical research.
Barnes et al. [19] agree that funding is a panacea for doing quality
research and promoting data openness in low-resource settings. We
note, however, that enthusiasm levels for sharing data vary from
field to field [14, 43, 109, 119].
Obstacles to data sharing are not only financial or infrastruc-
tural, but also extend into the political sphere. Bezuidenhout and
Rappert [28] raise a fundamental question regarding open data and
open science. Their study shows that data sharing and open data
practices are informed by Western perspectives, and are driven by
the contextual issues of Western researchers. Given that different
circumstances will give rise to different issues, they go on to ask
whether the value attached to data sharing is a specifically Western
one. The question becomes: Should the African continent aspire to
develop its own data sharing policies and initiatives grounded in its
distinct values, context, and communal culture? This perspective
takes data sharing challenges beyond the financial and technolog-
ical realms and suggests the need for a fundamental rethinking.
Yilma [126], for example, has proposed the absence of a strong po-
litical will as a major barrier to data sharing in Africa. Likening data
sharing practices to aid programs, Yilma states, “any type of aid
program that does not lead eventually to self-sufficiency is actually
destructive, just like welfare, and that is what has happened with
many aid programs in Africa” [126].
3 STORYTELLING AS A METHODOLOGY
“Stories are just data with soul" – Brene [31].
In this section, we illustrate the importance and relevance of
storytelling to our work. We first trace its historical significance
to the African continent before discussing our methodology for
creating personas aimed at presenting counternarratives.
3.1 Storytelling in Africa
Oral culture and the African continent are profoundly linked
in most spheres, from poetry and dance to philosophical tradi-
tions [92, 99, 111, 120]. Many philosophical ideas have deep roots
in the African continent [51, 76, 81, 103]. Ancient Egypt, for ex-
ample, marks the oldest known philosophical tradition [54, 67, 97].
Furthermore, in pre-colonial Africa philosophical practices among
indigenous peoples took the form of oral traditions [6, 55, 108].
Emphasizing the distinctness of oral traditions to the African con-
tinent, Okot p’Bitek [102] contends that oral practices are much
more immediate and powerful. In Oral Traditions as Philosophy:
Okot p’Bitek’s Legacy For African Philosophy, Imbo [55] further
331
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
demonstrates the unique significance of oral traditions in African
philosophy.
Storytelling is one important method for indigenous research,
and a tool to legally claim the right to local voices through which
narratives are validated [39, 47, 56, 73]. Making local communities
the focal perspective of shared knowledge through storytelling
counters histories of colonialism, knowledge produced for colonial
regimes, and the power dynamics silencing indigenous expertise
[10, 17, 77, 110]. In South Africa, for example, the Truth and Rec-
onciliation Commission (TRC) incorporated storytelling – songs,
poems, and oral literature – into the official legal process of speak-
ing aloud marginalized experiences of Apartheid [94]. In Uganda,
the National EducationMinistrymandates storytelling as part of the
required national curriculum. The Ugandan Education Ministry’s
curriculum reform since independence has likewise re-introduced
storytelling by law. These reforms are focused on re-instituting
local knowledge and teaching methods, as well as countering the
influences of former colonial powers [15, 83, 90, 112]. The African
StoryBook Project3, a repository of stories in local African lan-
guages, illustrates the value of both storytelling as a method of
knowledge creation and data sharing practices driven by commu-
nity needs. This open source repository of digital books written in
local African languages allows the re-purposing, scaling, and shar-
ing of content from the platform, helping the Ugandan Education
system to make the switch to teaching in local languages4.
African researchers and scientists have called for the inter-
national scientific community to embrace indigenous research
[20, 33, 38]. The call acknowledges how research design (e.g. how
“validity” is determined) could reflect Western values, and thus,
co-opt, erase, and/or circumvent legitimate means of expressing
knowledge. Problematically, many Global North research meth-
ods characterize local ways of creating and validating knowledge
as scientifically invalid [44, 63, 125]. Computational journal and
conference reviewers also insist on Global South authors contextu-
alizing research, including methods, in relation to the Global North.
We argue this demand erases and marginalizes local expertise.
3.2 Storytelling of African Data
Inspired by the role of storytelling in the African context, we illu-
minate challenges faced when accessing and sharing data in the
African continent from African perspectives. We do so through
personas created to portray recurring challenges we encountered
throughout our interviews, as well as our experiences of collecting,
accessing, sharing, and using data generated in the continent.
We constructed the personas through an iterative process based
on semi-structured interviews with ten African data experts. Our
interviewees included individuals working in universities, govern-
ments, startups, and think tanks, and we focused on data collected
and shared for research or policy purposes. We first developed
open-ended questions, guided by our experiences observing and
3https://www.africanstorybook.org/
4Although the African StoryBook Project can be seen as a powerful example, it is also
important to acknowledge that limitations and challenges remain for the Ugandan
Education system. For instance, the harms of colonial regimes are not extinguished
immediately upon instituting policy reforms. The dynamics of the global political
economy also continue to pressure national education systems to emphasize teaching
and establishing grading or progress standards for students that are measured by
English language competency, e.g. standardized tests
actuating data sharing practices on the continent. The interviews
were recorded with permission from the interviewees, after which
we manually transcribed the audio recordings. Next, we identified
and abstracted central themes, challenges, and concerns expressed
by the interviewees. Any information that could be used to identify
our interviewees, institutions, government bodies, or communities
was removed. In addition, we only took a particular challenge as
the inspiration for the creation of a persona if that challenge ap-
peared in at least three interviews. These decisions allowed us to
preserve the privacy of both the individuals we interviewed and the
communities of concern, while still creating space for discussing
common data sharing practices that are not affirming of the needs,
values, and concerns of those on the bottom of the iceberg. In re-
sponse to these privacy concerns, we did not incorporate any direct
quotations from our interviews into the personas, but we plan to
include data of this kind in subsequent publications.
Each persona consists of two to three core challenges. Over the
course of multiple meetings, we discussed and debated the efficacy
of each persona in portraying the challenges we would like to
elucidate. In our discussions, we primarily focused on the following
key questions:
(1) Do the personas elucidate the intended data sharing chal-
lenges, and if not, why not? How can we better bring these
challenges to the surface?
(2) Which data sharing challenges are more “familiar” to a di-
verse audience, including many researchers from the Global
North? In what ways should we amend the personas to hone
in on what challenges may be unique to the continent?
This process allowed the personas to evolve and solidify over
time.We rebalanced the emphasis on various themes in the personas
at times by adding details frommore interviews or removing details
from interviews that obfuscated the key challenges we would like
to highlight. In this paper, we present a sample of three personas
that illustrate the three key overarching challenges we found in
our work. Additional personas and details about this project are
shared on our project page.5
4 PERSONAS
“Proverbs are horses on which words ride, when words
are lost [i.e. when the truth of a matter is elusive], it is
proverbs we use to search for them [i.e. proverbs help us
to solve an intractable problem]” – Agbájé [11].
The personas we present below present recurring themes we
encountered in our interviews and subsequent discussions. These
stories are not meant to reflect the experiences of any single in-
dividual, community, company, or country, but rather to gather
evidence and shed light on recurring barriers. Since these stories
are based on aggregate information, they call attention to common
social issues while respecting sensitive dynamics – such as con-
cerns about privacy and retaliation – that may make interviewees,
and indeed many across the continent, vulnerable when sharing
these experiences. As such, these stories convey and conceal truths
at the same time.

Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Sharing in Africa FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
On Good and Harm
Themes: power imbalance, data colonialism
Context:
DrinkUS West is a Europe-based non-government organization
(NGO) working on sustainable access to water and health. DrinkUS
hopes to support people in Buranda – home to the yetet’ebek’e
community – by improving access to clean, potable water. It also
plans to deploy and test new water accessibility technology and
online monitoring of resources.
Data needs:
To provide adequate services and assess its impact, DrinkUS seeks
data about people’s day-to-day water use habits and experiences
through surveys. In the survey, DrinkUS researchers ask individual
respondents about their demographics (age, gender, income, marital
status, number of household members and children), discretionary
spending habits (ownership of computers, mobile phones, leisurely
activities), and water use habits (such as how water and utilities
are accessed, and the respondent’s knowledge of potable water
accessibility). Additionally, DrinkUS seeks country-wide data on
demographic patterns as well as outcomes related to health, educa-
tion, and poverty levels over the past decade. It gains access to this
data from the Buranda Health Ministry.
By using these two data sources, DrinkUS aims to estimate de-
mand for potable water, determine prices, and predict the impact
such a service may have on the health and economic welfare of the
community. Additionally, the NGO assesses technologies that could
be used to monitor and manage water access. As the NGO is keen to
engage survey participants in future opportunities, it collects con-
tact information such as the names, addresses, and phone numbers
of participants. DrinkUS incentivizes each respondent by paying
the equivalent of $5 U.S. dollars in Kwacha, the local currency, for
completing the estimated 30-minute long survey to improve survey
completion rate. From this data, DrinkUS researchers compile and
infer which members lack access to potable water, what community
members can afford to pay, and who is most at risk for water-related
health impacts and/or disease. They combine these results with
data obtained from the Buranda Health Ministry to gain deeper in-
sights into the impact of access to potable water. This work is later
published as a research paper at a top-tier international conference
on data science for social good.
Data sharing challenges:
While employees at DrinkUS meticulously checked their survey
design, they did not seek adequate feedback from the yetet’ebek’e
community beyond a few initial meetings. The yetet’ebek’e commu-
nity is not treated as a mutual partner in the broader project design.
In fact, there is an implicit assumption that improving water ac-
cess for the community is an adequate benefit, and that DrinkUS is
therefore justified in collecting and owning the survey data. Further,
since DrinkUS is a world-renowned NGO working in partnership
with the Burandan government, it wields significant power over
members of the yetet’ebek’e community. Even the pay incentives,
which may be negligible for the NGO, are significant due to cur-
rency exchange rates, further highlighting a power imbalance.
Given that the NGO proceeded without consulting the commu-
nity, it likely failed to grasp all of the central issues and potential
harms from the perspective of the community. Sharing their re-
search findings publicly, including their predictions about which
geographic locations in the yetet’ebek’e community were at risk for
water-related disease, put the community at risk, as many belong
to marginalized ethnic groups. Such findings, even shared in aggre-
gate, can reveal information on the community as a whole. While
notions of privacy often focus on the individual [52, 65], there is
growing awareness that collective identity is also important within
many African communities, and that sharing aggregate informa-
tion about communities can also be regarded as a privacy violation
[45, 89].
In addition, given the partnershipwith the Burandan government
and poorly defined protocols around data sharing and use, survey
participant data was shared with government officials, including
data about household composition and reported or predicted health
challenges linked to potable water access. While the researchers
vetted their questions for survey design validity, they did not seek
active involvement from the yetet’ebek’e community to discuss
whom the data can be shared with and for what purposes. DrinkUS
also failed to solicit feedback on the broader project design, data
ownership and its use beyond original scope of work, and research
procedures. This disempowerment of local communities in the
decision-making process introduced trust issues both with the NGO
as well as with the Burandan government, which has been known
to engage in open data sharing practices with large NGOs and
institutions. Local communities, on the other hand, cannot access
their own data with the same ease.
The Journey of African Scholars
Themes: trust, awareness
Context:
A doctoral candidate from Bozatta researching in Nova Africa wants
to collect soil samples from several Nova Africa provinces for her
research. Her study aims to investigate the fertility of soil samples,
which will inform key stakeholders, such as the Government and
NGOs, to find the best approaches to assisting farmers.
In another case study, a doctoral candidate is researching the
prevalence of gender-based violence in Nova Africa. The study
is targeted towards raising awareness of gender-based violence
prevalence, which remains a profound and widespread problem in
Nova Africa.
Data needs:
Case 1: Soil and apartheid
The researcher has outlined critical steps to conducting the soil
fertility test, using techniques such as sampling, analysis, inter-
pretation, and recommendation. All of these methods are essential
for estimating soil fertility. Enthusiastic about undertaking her re-
search, the researcher aims to collect these samples to determine
soil fertility, nutrient deficiencies, and recommendations, such as
selecting the most favourable fertilizer plan to increase farmers’
productivity. The information gathered from the study will be used
to create an effective fertility management program and provide
findings to the public through her dissertation and institutional
public databases.

Case 2: Gender-based violence
The researcher aims to collect this data and create a data platform
to present gender-based violence cases within provinces in Nova
Africa. The tool will aid data visualisation of these cases and will
be available to the broader public. The researcher understands
that her work is focused on a pressing issue: Gender-based
violence remains a persistent problem, requiring attention from
multi-faceted responses and commitments from the government,
civil society, and other citizens. In particular, the government does
not keep track of data on the prevalence of gender-based violence,
despite desire to work towards protections for the vulnerable. The
researcher’s work aims to narrow this data gap.
Data sharing challenges:
In Case 1, in an attempt to collect soil samples, the researcher learns
that farmers are not enthusiastic about sharing this information,
but she is unable to understand why. After months of attempts, she
eventually learns from her colleagues that farmers have collected
such data for their own internal purposes, and use it to organize
within their communities. The researcher attempts to instead
obtain this data, assuming that the farmers’ reluctance may be
partially due to replication of efforts. She eventually learns that
the farmers are reluctant to share any information due to fear that
the government might want to claim ownership of their lands.
Collection of such data is a challenge for local researchers as well.
This issue is exacerbated by the history of a former apartheid
regime, under whose reign land grabs were widespread, impacting
Black Nova Africans primarily. Since sharing data can lead to
forfeiture of land rights, trust is a central issue for the farmers in
deciding how much information they share and with whom.
In Case 2, during the process of conducting the research, the
doctoral candidate experiences a few unexpected encounters and
shares them with some colleagues from Nova Africa. She tells
them that many participants became emotional when sharing
their experiences, and asked that the session be discontinued.
One participant even questioned why the interview was so
intrusive, and decided not to share further information. Her
officemate tells her that in Nova Africa, it is challenging to
convince participants to release information, especially as a
foreigner. There is a perceived notion that foreigners are here
to steal from them, whether that be data or resources. This, she
learns, is in part reflective of and caused by divisions across
communities in Africa due to colonialism. Another colleague
advises her that some participants might seek secluded venues that
are secure for sharing experiences in most rural areas, but that
building trust is crucial, especially as an outsider of this community.
Young researchers working across different African countries
may encounter challenges when trying to collect, access, and share
data. This challenge is particularly stark when the researcher is not
a local to the region or community in which the data is being col-
lected. Differences in languages and cultures, as well as imbalances
in trust and power, breed suspicion about motives, impeding data
access and sharing. With more than 1500 languages spoken across
the African continent, locals residing in rural areas are more likely
to communicate in their dialect, with potentially little or no under-
standing of national languages. This concern may, at times, stand
in contrast to the fact that there is a pressing need on high-quality
data to understand the prevalence and impact of issues such as
gender-based violence, among numerous other forms of injustices
and discrimination.
Discussions on data sharing in the African context often treat
the continent as a monolith and frame problems as a Global
North/Global South issue. However, the complex data sharing
ecosystem can lead to challenges even for those based in the conti-
nent. We further find that many issues with power imbalances and
trust can be traced back to the impact of entities based outside of
the continent. We see, for instance, that certain hesitations with
sharing data are rooted in colonial-era extracting practices whose
impact can be felt to this day. Numerous efforts to mitigate inequali-
ties in data access and sharing in the continent, and especially those
driven by initiatives outside of the continent, may not be attuned
to the complex data landscape resulting from a diversity of needs,
priorities, and experiences of those in the continent.
Livestocks and Livelihoods
Themes: data infrastructure, awareness
Context:
A researcher in Wolonda receives a two-year grant from a large
foundation from the Global North. The research project outlines an
ambitious goal of ushering in prosperity for the livestock farmers
by making the mainstream markets work for them.
Data needs:
The researcher outlined his intentions to collect various types of
data,including genomic data of crops and livestock and enterprise
data for the farm. The genomic dataset would help determine if the
right crops were being planted and the right animal breeds being
reared to support the production system. It would help provide the
farmers vital intelligence on susceptibility of their crops and animals
to diseases and performance of their farm against aggregate data.
The project was structured as a donor-funded research endeavor,
with clear data collection and analysis objectives. Yet no protocols
for data storage and scope of use were defined, and there were
no clear guidelines on whether the data can be shared with third
parties. Furthermore, scant information was provided as to if and
how the collected data would be used beyond the time period of
the donor-funded project.
As expected, the researcher and his team diligently collected the
genomic data as well as the farm data from a cluster of villages in
several counties of Southern Wolonda. The data collection process
was, however, more challenging than originally anticipated. Even
with a local team well-versed in the norms and practices of the
region, farmers seemed skeptical to give up their data. Slowly,
as the end of the two-year grant period approached, the data
collection exercise also came to a close.
Data sharing challenges:
Encouraged by this newly collected and valuable dataset, a research
team established a for-profit company using the data collected as
part of the research project. In its mission statement, the company
articulated the need for precision agriculture in today’s data-rich
334

environment as an enabler of better agricultural practices. The
source data on which the company was built came from that dataset
which was collected as part of the original research project. In
addition, due to infrastructure challenges, the data is now housed
in a data center at a University in the Eastern United Provinces, an
influential country in the Global North which is also home to the
foundation that originally funded this research.
The company has set its sights on expanding across Wolonda.
Even though the trust established with the farmers in Southern
Wolonda has eroded due to the actions of the researcher, he is
confident that other farmers will see the potential of his data engine
and believe in the power of its predictive analytics.
Foundations in the Global North may be eager to fund data col-
lection projects in an attempt to create an oasis in regions perceived
to be data-starved – to bridge data gaps and inequalities that appear
to be merely inefficiencies. Yet, as is the case in this scenario, the
lack of forethought into the ethical use of data – not only during the
lifetime of the project, but also thereafter – can create irreparable
harms to communities’ well-being and make it difficult to build
partnerships based on respect and mutual trust. This above case
may alienate the farmers, precisely the people whom this project
was ostensibly seeking to support.
5 DATA SHARING CHALLENGES
As the personas in the last section show, obstacles, issues, and
challenges of data sharing concerning the African continent are
multifaceted. Questions such as, ‘Is data sharing beneficial? Valu-
able?’ need to be contextualized by subcommunity: We need to also
ask ‘for whom?’ Throughout this work, we have examined such
questions in a manner that is informed by the perspective of the
stakeholders at the bottom of the data ecology chain – the hidden
part of the iceberg. There are numerous causes for challenges in
this ecosystem. In this section, we focus on three broad and inter-
related challenges that surfaced from our interviews and research.
In particular, we explore: power asymmetries, issues of trust, and
the need for contextual knowledge.
5.1 Power asymmetries
Historically, traditional colonial powers sought unilateral domi-
nation over colonized people through control of socio-economic
affairs and the reinvention of social orders for their own benefit
[98]. In the current day-and-age, when data and digital technolo-
gies are powerful instruments, colonial-era oppression has been
reincarnated in various data practices, including data collection,
sharing, and analysis [29, 62]. The search for data accumulation,
especially with regard to Western technology monopolies — both
the scale as well as the manner in which it is being collected —
have raised questions regarding unprecedented wealth accumula-
tion and power struggles. Currently, a significant proportion of
Africa’s digital infrastructure is controlled by Western technology
powers such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Uber. Traditional
colonial powers pursued colonial invasion through justifications,
such as “educating the uneducated.” Data accumulation processes
are accompanied by similar colonial rhetoric, such as “liberating
the bottom billion,” “helping the unbanked,” “connecting the uncon-
nected,” and using data to “leapfrog poverty.” However, this rhetoric
may not only preserves historical coloniality [80] dressed in data,
but also perpetuates deficit narratives. These objections have been
articulated by scholars and technologists within the continent. For
instance, Kimani [62] writes:
“I find it hard to reconcile a group of American cor-
porations, far removed from the realities of Africans,
machinating a grand plan on how to save the un-
banked women of Africa. Especially when you con-
sider their recent history of data privacy breaches
(Facebook) and worker exploitation (Uber)." [62]
Colonial legacies and power imbalances embedded in data prac-
tices may appear less obvious and more nuanced within scientific
research settings [16]. Within the context of global health research,
there has been growing concern about power imbalances in author-
ship, which has negatively affected how research undertaken by
local researchers in low-income and middle-income countries (es-
pecially in Africa) is perceived [1]. Academics in the Global North
are bestowed with the power to define what constitutes “legitimate
knowledge,” “good research,” “standard method,” or a relevant and
worthwhile problem. As a result, African researchers are left little
room, if any at all, to compete at the global stage, even in matters
concerning the African continent. Following extensive analysis of
interviews with senior university research managers in Zimbabwe,
and on a public roundtable on Structural Inequalities in Global
Academic Publishing, Jeater [59] finds that “When we ask who gets
to represent the ‘African perspective,’ we find it is decreasingly un-
African.” Resource inequalities, hegemonic academic standards that
undervalue Southern research traditions, and the unilateral power
Northerners hold to validate research, all contribute to structural
obstacles that amount to systemic exclusion of African scholarship
from global health research. In a data ecosystem built on such firm
yet invisible power asymmetries, stakeholders already in a position
of power not only benefit the most, but also make data accessibility
inequitable.
Imbalances in authorship and power asymmetries constitute a
continuation of the colonial project in global health research, creat-
ing fundamental trust issues concerning data sharing. Underneath
power asymmetries in global health research partnerships between
researchers from the North and South, lies what Abimbola [1] calls
“the foreign gaze.” In his analysis of this concept, Abimbola asks
questions such as “who we are as authors, who we imagine we
write for (i.e., gaze), and the position or standpoint from which we
write (i.e., pose).” Furthermore, power asymmetries which occupy
an important space around trust and data sharing often operate in
invisible ways and take many forms.
In a similar study that explores power imbalances between the
global North and South, using Zambia as a case study, Walsh et al.
[124] report that power imbalances and inequalities manifest at all
stages of research. This includes everything from funding to agenda
setting, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of re-
sults. Looking at the underfunded Zambian health research, where
up to 90% of the funding for health research comes from external
funders [124], the bargaining power rests with the funders with lit-
tle room for negotiations for Zambian scholars. Power asymmetries
are also observed in the personas above. In “On Good and Harm”, we
find the European NGO at the top of the power hierarchy making
335
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
key decisions regarding the data concerning yetet’ebek’e commu-
nities. Similarly, in the “Livestocks and Livelihoods” persona, the
foundation from the Global North which provided grants dedicated
to research in Wolonda holds much greater authority and power
compared to the villagers who are the source of the data.
Power asymmetries, historically inherited from the colonial era,
often get carried over into data practices and manifest themselves in
various forms, from imbalanced authorship to uneven bargaining
powers that come with funding. Having said that, power asym-
metries are not limited to historical contexts only. Within a given
research project, for example, one can observe that power asym-
metries exist between project managers and data analysts; data
analysts and data collectors; data collectors and research partic-
ipants. All these factors are contingent on various caveats and
implications for trust impacting data processes from data quality
to data sharing. Examining data production and consumption pro-
cess in the context of Malawian demographic survey, Biruk [30]
makes these power asymmetries, hierarchies and structural inequal-
ities visible. Although obscured by partnership rhetoric, Malawian
demographics mapping in fact embodies structures with unequal
division of labor. Biruk explains:
“[B]eing on the ground in the field has the largest effect on
data but—from the perspective of researchers—the activities
of fieldworkers are framed as menial labor performed by
easily replaceable and interchangeable individuals. The local
expertise they offer, then, is not in designing research or
writing proposals but comes as an additive to a project con-
ceived in a distant office. These hierarchies are embedded in
political-economic structures that privilege the knowledge
work that is the purview of Western academic researchers
over the so-called unskilled labor performed by field work-
ers. Meanwhile, Malawian research collaborators occupy a
middle space that is both constructed by and fraught with
power and economic inequalities.” [30]
5.2 Trust
“Data often move at the speed of trust.” – Hamilton
and Hopkins [104]
Sharing data between different stakeholders hinges on trust.
Trust is the fundamental component of all relationships in a data
sharing ecosystem. While trust, or lack thereof, has been identified
as a key challenge that hampers data sharing [7, 37, 58, 109], there
remainsmuch to be examined about the role of trust and how it man-
ifests in relationships between various stakeholders in the African
data sharing ecosystem. Data sharing practices which operate in
the absence of knowledge of local norms and contexts contribute
– albeit indirectly – to the erosion of trust among stakeholders in
the data sharing ecosystem. Initiatives coming from outside, with
their own assumptions, interests, and objectives, tend to be met
with suspicion by local communities. The persona on “Soil and
Apartheid” captures this in a stark manner; due to the apartheid
regime, the doctoral researcher finds that Black farmers in Nova
Africa suffered unjust land grabs. Such historical injustice plays out
in the farmers’ reluctance to share soil data due to lack of trust.
Resource inequalities and colonial oppressive histories instill
deep mistrust towards open data and data sharing initiatives. Al-
though African researchers are generally supportive of data sharing,
they are considerably less enthusiastic about open data express-
ing concerns that open data compromises national ownership and
reopens the gates for “parachute-research” (i.e., Global Northern
researchers absconding with data to their home countries). Such
concerns are not unwarranted. In fact, the findings from a recent
study from Mbaye et al. [75] affirm this fear. Mbaye et al. [75]
performed a systematic review examining African author propor-
tions in the biomedical literature published between 1980 - 2016, in
which research was originally done in Africa. The authors found
that African researchers are significantly under-represented in the
global health community, evenwhen the data originates fromAfrica.
A common threat is parachute-research, in which non-African re-
searchers benefit from data sharing and open data, are afforded
the opportunity to narrate African stories (in some cases also con-
tributing to deficit narratives), and publish scientific work using
African generated data available through open access initiatives –
all while ignoring the contributions of African communities and
scholars [66, 74, 82, 127]. Recent work within the medical sciences
published on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo can be cited as a prime example in this regard.
Ideal data sharing initiatives, policies, and principles weigh the
benefits and potential risks, and strive to find a reasonable balance.
Benefits and risks also vary depending on the types of data being
shared. For example, the use of genomics data poses the potential
for far more detrimental risk to the individual providing the data, to
the researcher, to the institution, and to the community compared
to soil data. The issues of trust as a challenge to data sharing,
likewise, vary in degree depending on the data in question. Trust
is a relatively significant challenge to sharing sensitive biomedical
or health data and less significant when it comes to, for example,
environmental sciences data. Noting this concern, Walport and
Brest [123] emphasize, “people often agree to provide sensitive data
because they trust the researcher and believe the researcher would
not use the data in a way that would be harmful towards them.
However, there is a concern that the trust may not carry over when
the data are shared”.
5.3 Contexts and local knowledge
Contexts are a crucial element to making sense of data and data
sharing. Yet data – within data science and machine learning, par-
ticularly – are often stripped away of contexts [35, 70, 78]. In the
process of data cleaning, for example, information that provides
contexts about the specific background from which data are col-
lected and how datasets are structured can be lost [5]. The impor-
tance of context for datasets has been explored by scholars, such as
Loukissas [69], according to whom, we should shift into thinking
in terms of data settings instead of datasets. Contexts are crucial
to understanding data fully; data sharing practices that discard
contexts risk becoming irrelevant and potentially harmful to local
communities, as we see in each of the above personas.
Consequently, the context of the data itself – which provides
a complete image – and awareness of local norms, cultures, and
histories constitute crucial elements in a responsible data sharing
336
Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Sharing in Africa FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
practice. Thus, for data sharing practices to benefit the underserved,
such groups’ welfare and interests need to be placed at the center
stage. However, our interviewees nearly unanimously agree that
there remains a lot to be done to acknowledge and incorporate the
interest, norms, and context of these below the iceberg in Figure 1.
In fact, oftentimes, certain groups such as data subjects are hardly
recognized as stakeholders at all [12, 49, 61].
We see various levels of disregard for context and local norms
displayed in all the personas portrayed in the previous section.
In "On Good and Harm", the failure to ground data collection in
communal understanding of privacy, for example, resulted in the
NGO exposing yetet’ebek’e community to various risks in the pro-
cess of data sharing. Lack of common language and understanding
of local norms creates a challenge for intra-continental data prac-
tice, as shown in "The Journey of African Scholars." In both cases,
the doctoral candidate faced difficulties understanding the local
norms, which played a role in the community’s lack of trust to-
wards her. Similarly, in the "Livestocks and Livelihoods" persona, we
observe that the funding foundation (from the Global North) failed
to consider the context in which the data was collected. In sum-
mary, data sharing calls that are not aware of local norms, contexts,
and culture, when imposed from the outside, constitutes a form of
Western-centrism and colonialism.
6 DISCUSSION
Returning to the question “is data sharing good/beneficial?” we
argue that responsible data sharing practices must, first and fore-
most, benefit local communities and experts, with a focus on those
at the bottom of the iceberg. In recent years, the African conti-
nent as a whole has been considered a frontier opportunity for
building data collection infrastructures. The enthusiasm around
data sharing, and especially in machine learning or data science
for development/social good settings, has ranged from tempered
discussions around new research avenues to proclamations that
“the AI invasion is coming to Africa (and it’s a good thing)" [91]. In
this work, we echo previous discussions that this can lead to data
colonialism and significant, irreparable harm to communities. As
we learned from the rich body of previous works, our experiences,
interviews and the personas, data sharing practices are divergent,
ad hoc, at times contradictory, and/or violate community values
for data use. As machine learning and data science move to focus
on the Global South and especially the African continent, the need
to understand what challenges exist in data sharing, and how we
can improve data practices become more pressing.
Despite significant variation among the different countries on
the continent, many countries are now producing high-quality
data in a more reliable and regular manner through statistical of-
fices, national efforts, and involvement of other public agencies.
Likewise, non-public sectors actors — such as private-sector compa-
nies, academic institutions, civil society organisations, development
agencies, and individuals or communities — are now encouraged
and incentivized to be involved in open data management. The
future of open data management and data sharing and their con-
tribution to the advancement of science and technology in Africa
will continue to increase, despite the slow pace caused by the lack
of funding, redundant policy frameworks, and limited infrastruc-
tures. The unique African landscape, and especially the existing
challenges and how they can be addressed, will continue to play
a big part in African participation in open science and open data
global projects [26].
As explained by Bangani and Moyo [18], to understand the shar-
ing practices of researchers, it is essential first to know where the
data comes from and the lives, cultures, and communities it rep-
resents. Bangani and Moyo [18] also conclude that most of the
emerging researchers in South Africa would prefer to use data from
other sources and are not interested in sharing their own data. Most
of these emerging researchers indicated a lack of resources, misuse
of data, and trust issues as the significant challenges they face in
sharing their data. Some of them indicated that they would prefer
to only share their data with collaborators within their universities
and not with collaborators outside their universities. For many of
the researchers in this context, the labour, effort, and time it takes
to collect data is unmatched by the benefits (often little if any at
all) they might receive from data sharing. Subsequently, as well
as encouraging researchers to share their data, there also needs to
be actionable benefits and rewards, as well as policies that protect
African researchers and communities from practices like parachute
research.
Open data imposes risks to African communities – in terms of
both stripping data away from contexts and reduced benefits to
communities where data is sourced. It may present a possibility
for Global North researchers to publish research using data from
Global South with neither acknowledgements to data collectors
or data subjects nor an understanding of the data setting. Conse-
quently, there should be less pressure to open up data and more
incentives to share data with the necessary conditions and support
for infrastructures. The necessary conditions could include data
sharing guidelines that give adequate time to African researchers
to make use of data before wider sharing [117].
There are various ways towards equitable data sharing that ben-
efit of local communities. As we have seen in the data sharing
challenges section (Section 5), responsible data sharing not only
requires knowledge of the context of data, it also needs to center
the interests and norms of communities where data comes from.
Data sharing calls that are not aware of local norms, contexts,
and culture, when imposed from the outside, constitute a form of
Western-centrism and colonialism. For those coming from outside
to participate in data sharing activities, learning “the ways of the
people” without infiltrating their cultures need to be considered
a vital part of the process. Providing sufficient support to local re-
searchers with the aim of facilitating local-led data sharing practices
can be one of the initial steps.
Trust is critical during data sharing. Trust is built if those in-
volved know each other. The reason for sharing is explicitly stated
to all the stakeholders involved. Each stakeholder performs their
responsibility as agreed, and all stakeholders’ expectations are de-
fined, understood, and respected. Supposing all stakeholders agree
to these conditions, the likelihood of further collaboration and the
possibility of fair sharing increases. It is recommended that the
process of data sharing should be transparent. Also, researchers
based in the continent are encouraged to build a trustworthy col-
laboration with funders and other stakeholders. Introducing proper
337
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
and adequate legal frameworks, documentation, and support for
data sharing will increase trust among stakeholders. Due to uncer-
tainties and lack of legal frameworks, several sectors in Africa are
unsure of data sharing norms and practices. They are allowed to
share their data, what type of data can be shared, who, and under
what conditions. Such frameworks and documentation can help
clarify the benefits, expected norms, and equitable data sharing
practices. Such can help build trust and encourage researchers to
share their data in a manner that acknowledges their labour and
protects their ideas and innovations.
Equitable data sharing is also a matter of training the next gen-
eration of data scientists. It is imperative to include African data
challenges into the data science curricula since these issues are
very different from other parts of the world. Aspiring data scien-
tists must be aware of data sources, and historical records about
communities where data are collected and the harm these collected
data may pose.
Many of the challenges we have discussed here – such as data
sharing in the absence of awareness of local contexts and norms
as well as the issue of trust – are daunting, and lack simple an-
swers. Nonetheless, as we have sketched in the above sections, they
are challenges that will need to be overcome to reduce commu-
nity harm. The much larger and nuanced issues of data sharing,
such as power asymmetry and underlying coloniality, Euro and
Anglo-centrism, white supremacy, are obstacles that need deeper
structural and social changes. They present challenges with no clear
solutions. Understanding and acknowledging their invisible oper-
ations is a vital part of the process, and may point to how power
asymmetries can be re-balanced. In this work, we have brought to
light these invisible forces. While our work focuses on data access
and data sharing, we note, also that many of the issues discussed
may impact processes across the data generation, collection, label-
ing, analyses, implementation, and use pipeline. Each of these, we
believe, warrants further investigation.
Last, beyond shedding light on the complex data sharing and
data practice challenges in the continent, our work also uplifts
research on this topic done by Africans for Africans. This practice of
centering African scholarship itself challenges negative stereotypes
of the continent as “uneducated population.” There is a vast body of
work examining the rapidly evolving data practices of the African
continent and its relationship with the global data ecosystem.6 In
the same way that data sharing challenges cannot be overcome
without understanding local contexts, meaningful solutions will
not be reached without deep engagement with African scholarship.
