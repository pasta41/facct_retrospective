ABSTRACT
Diversity in personalized news recommender systems is often de-
fined as dissimilarity, and operationalized based on topic diversity
(e.g., corona versus farmers strike). Diversity in news media, how-
ever, is understood as multiperspectivity (e.g., different opinions on
corona measures), and arguably a key responsibility of the press in
a democratic society. While viewpoint diversity is often considered
synonymous with source diversity in communication science do-
main, in this paper, we take a computational view.We operationalize
the notion of framing, adopted from communication science. We
apply this notion to a re-ranking of topic-relevant recommended
lists, to form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method.
Our offline evaluation indicates that the proposed method is capa-
ble of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists
according to a diversity metric from literature. In an online study,
on the Blendle platform, a Dutch news aggregator, with more than
2000 users, we found that users are willing to consume viewpoint
diverse news recommendations. We also found that presentation char-
acteristics significantly influence the reading behaviour of diverse
recommendations. These results suggest that future research on
presentation aspects of recommendations can be just as impor-
tant as novel viewpoint diversification methods to truly achieve
multiperspectivity in online news environments.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, traditional news sources are increasingly using
online news platforms to distribute their content. Digital-born news
websites and news aggregators, which combine content from various
sources in one service, are also gaining ground [29]. In 2015, 23% of
survey respondents reported online media as their primary news
source, and 44% considered digital and traditional sources equally
relevant [29]. This change also induces a wide adoption of news
recommender systems that automatically provide personalized news
recommendations to users.
Communication studies acknowledge two important roles of
media in a democratic society [17]: (1) to inform citizens about im-
portant societal and political issues and (2) to foster a diverse public
sphere. Both roles are then related to multiple social-cultural ob-
jectives of democracy, such as informed decision-making, cultural
pluralism and citizens welfare [24, 34]. The role of news recom-
mender systems in promoting these democratic values is under
heavy discussion in academic debate. For example, filter bubbles
received increasing awareness, suggesting that high levels of per-
sonalisation would lock people up people in bubbles of what they
already know or think [30]. According to Helberger, the democratic
role of news recommender systems mainly depends on the demo-
cratic theory that is being followed, such as liberal, participatory,
or deliberative [17]. Thus, the development of viewpoint diversi-
fication methods can be in particular motivated in relation to the
participatory and deliberative model.
Current diversification methods [21, 43], however, do not ad-
dress viewpoint diversity, but define diversity as dissimilarity, or
topic diversity (e.g., corona versus farmers strike). Therefore, cur-
rent diversification methods are not applicable in the news domain,
and novel viewpoint diversification methods are needed to main-
tain and assure multiperspectivity in online news environments.
Moreover, to truly enablemultiperspectivity, users should be willing
to consume viewpoint-diverse recommendations. Their behaviour
should be studied in real, online scenarios, to ensure that diversifi-
cation criteria does not damage the adoption of the recommended
items and thus, lead to the total rejection of the news recommender
platform. Thus, we investigate the following research questions:
R1: How is reading behaviour affected by viewpoint diverse news
recommendations?
R2: How is reading behaviour affected by presentation character-
istics of viewpoint diverse news recommendations?
To answer these questions, we propose a re-ranking approach
for lists of recommended articles based on aspects of news frames,
a concept taken from communication studies. In particular, a news
frame describes how to identify a view on an issue, in a given

article [12]. Thus, by bridging aspects from the social and the com-
putational domains, we aim to overcome the current gap between
the definition of diversity in recommender systems and news media.
During an offline evaluation, the proposed method increased
the viewpoint diversity of recommended lists of news articles on
several topics. Further, we measured the influence of the viewpoint
diversification method on the reading behaviour of more than 2000
users, which are likely to interact with the recommended articles, in
an online study on the Blendle1 platform, a Dutch news aggregator.
We found that reading behaviour of users that received diverse rec-
ommendations was comparable with the reading behaviour of users
that received news articles optimized only for relevance. However,
we did find a positive influence of two presentation characteristics
on the click-through rate of recommendations — news articles with
thumbnails and news articles with more hearts are read more often.
Therefore, we make the following contributions:2
• a novel method for viewpoint diversification using re-ranking
of news recommendation lists, based on framing aspects;
• an online evaluation with more than 2000 users, on the
Blendle platform, to understand:
(a) how viewpoint-diverse recommendations affect the read-
ing behaviour of users; and
(b) how article’s presentation characteristics affect the reading
behaviour of users.
2 RELATEDWORK
In this section, we first investigate how communication science
understands diversity. Then, we review current approaches for
diversity in recommender systems. This allow us to bridge the gap
between the domains of communication and computer science, by
operationalizing framing aspects in a diversification algorithm.
2.1 Diversity in News Media
In news media, diversity refers to multiperspectivity or diversity of
viewpoints [14]. In communication science, diversity is, in general,
a key measure for news quality [9, 22, 31], thus fostering democratic
aspects, such as informed decision-making, cultural pluralism and
citizens welfare [26, 40]. Two main approaches to assess diversity
can be distinguished: source and content diversity [2, 6, 26], with
most studies focusing on source diversity [1, 2, 26, 40]. When mea-
suring source diversity, most methods follow Bennett [5]’s index-
ing theory, which assumes that including non-official or non-elite
sources corresponds to high levels of diversity [2]. Alternatively,
Napoli [26] approaches the issue as a policymaker and distinguishes
three aspects of source diversity: content ownership, ownership of
media outlets, and the workforce within individual media outlets.
Critics, however, state that multiple sources can still foster the
same point of view and therefore, source diversity is not a direct
measure for viewpoint diversity [40]. Multiple studies also indicate
that power distributions in society, commercial pressure of news
media and journalistic norms and practices, significantly influence
which sources gain media access [2, 6]. Therefore, it is often argued
that viewpoint diversity can only be achieved by fostering content
diversity [3, 9, 14, 22, 26, 40]. Content diversity is defined in [37]
1https://blendle.com/
2Repository: https://github.com/mats-mulder/FAccT2021-OperationalizingFraming
as “heterogeneity of media content in terms of one or more specified
characteristics”. Baden and Springer [2] identified six common ap-
proaches to assess content diversity. The first three methods focus
on the tone or political position represented in the news, i.e., the
inclusion of non-official positions, the diversity of political tone.
These methods, however, assume that political disagreement equals
viewpoint diversity [2]. Another approach uses language diversity
to evaluate content diversity. However, this is again no direct mea-
sure, since different language can describe the same perspective [2].
The final two approaches assess content diversity by means of
frames. Framing theory states that every communicative message
selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the complex reality [2].
Thereby, frames enable different interpretations of the same issue
[33]. Porto [31] states that news environments need to be evalu-
ated by their ability to provide diverse frames. Baden and Springer
[2] describe three frames’ aspects, central to the role of viewpoint
diversity in democratic media. First, frames create different interpre-
tations of the same issue by selecting some aspects of the complex
reality [13]. Second, frames are not neutral but suggest specific
evaluations and courses of actions that serve some purpose better
than other [12]. Third, frames are often strategically constructed to
advocate particular political views and agendas. Framing, thus, can
be a suitable conceptualization of viewpoint diversity.
2.2 Diversity in Recommender Systems
Traditionally, research on recommender systems focused on eval-
uating their performance in terms of accuracy [43]. Such focus,
however, induced a problem which is known as over-fitting, e.g.,
a model is fitted so strongly to a user that it is unable to detect
any other interests [21]. Additionally, there is a need for more user-
centric evaluations of recommender systems. Thus, diversity has
become one of the most prominent beyond-accuracy metrics for
recommender systems [43]. In this context, diversity is generally
defined as the opposite of similarity [21], and it is often based on
topic diversity (e.g., corona versus farmers strike). For example,
Ziegler et al. [43] proposed a topic diversification method based in
the intra-list diversity metric.
Current diversification methods for recommender systems, thus,
do not focus on viewpoint diversity and are not applicable in the
news domain. To the best of our knowledge, only one study for
viewpoint diversification has been proposed so far [36]. They pro-
pose a new distance measure for viewpoint diversity based on
linguistic representations of news articles. This diversity measure
was then applied in a post-processing re-ranking algorithm [8] to a
list of news articles. These allowed optimizing for the balance be-
tween topic relevance and viewpoint diversity. In a small scale user
study [36], readers indicated a lower intent to consume diversified
content, motivating the need to study behavioural measures for
newsreaders on a larger scale. Thus, we argue that more research
is required to understand the relationship between the metric and
the influence on readers behaviour.
In this work, we bridge the current gap between the notion of
framing in communication science and computational approaches.
Additionally, we study how viewpoint diversification affects news-
readers’ behaviour in an applied setting. The next section justifies
the operationalization of framing in the computational domain.

3 FRAMING FOR VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY
Framing is an extensively researched concept in different domains,
including psychology, communication and sociology, having its
roots in the latter domain. Bateson [4] states that communication
only gets meaning in its context and by the way the message is con-
structed. Later, frame theory gained increasing momentum and was
generally understood as follows: every communicative message se-
lectively emphasizes certain aspects of a complex reality [2]. Thus,
every news article (unintentionally) comprises some form of fram-
ing [2]. Frames are often deliberately used to construct strategic,
often political, views on a topic. Consequently, frames enable dif-
ferent interpretations of the same issue [2]. However, every frame
inevitably deselects other, equally plausible and relevant frame [2].
When considering frames in news articles, multiple definitions
exist [10, 13, 15]. However, the definition of Entman [12] is the
most commonly adopted in the literature. It states that framing
includes the selection of “some aspects of perceived reality and make
the more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote
a particular definition of a problem, causal interpretation, moral
evaluation and treatment recommendation for the item described”.
Within this definition, the problem describes four framing functions:
(1) Problem Definition : “what a causal agent is doing with
what costs and benefits”; e.g., a second Coronavirus wave is
approaching;
(2) Causal Attribution : “identifying the forces creating the
problem”; e.g., (it is due to the) government policy response;
(3) Moral Evaluation : “evaluate causal agents and their ef-
fects”; e.g., response to approaching second wave came too
late (negative evaluation);
(4) Treatment Recommendation : “offer and justify treat-
ments for the problems and predict their likely effects”; e.g.,
there must be predefined measures to be deployed at a critical
threshold of virus spread.
Frames can be found at different levels of analysis, including single
sentences, paragraphs or articles as a whole [12]. A frame, however,
may not necessarily include all the four functions.
Most framing analysis approaches focus on manual analysis of
articles [20, 23, 39]. Only recently, some computer-assisted methods
gained interest [7, 16, 41]. As a result, the identification of frames
often falls into a methodological black box [23]. Thereby, the main
issue includes the ambiguity of “which elements should be present
in an article or news story to signify the existence of a frame” [23].
To overcome this problem, some recent studies [2, 23, 39] propose
a novel identification method based on the extraction of the four
aforementioned framing aspects in the definition of Entman [12].
3.1 Focus Group Setup
To guide the operationalization of framing, we began with a quali-
tative analysis. In a small focus group, we aimed to gain insights
into how the four framing functions of the main frame of an article
manifest in its content and how to identify them computationally.
Participants. We invited three experts in the field of news fram-
ing analysis. All experts had a background in journalism, commu-
nication, or news media, and multiple years of relevant experience.
Materials. As a basis for discussion, we used opinion pieces on
the topic of Dutch farmers protests. Opinion pieces refer to news
articles that reflect the authors opinion and thus, do not claim to
be objective. Our domain experts indicated that this type of news
article is the most suitable to identify framing functions.
Procedure. The focus group procedure consisted of two steps.
1. Annotation session: First, the participants were asked to per-
form framing analysis on an opinion piece, using the four framing
functions as described by Entman [12]. In particular, the partici-
pants had to individually highlight parts of the article, such as word
clauses or sentences, that can be related to one of the four framing
functions of the main frame of the news article.
2. Review session: Second, the results were discussed, together
with some general questions on news article analysis and framing.
For every highlighted part, we asked the participants to motivate
why the highlighted part is related to one of the four framing func-
tions. Besides, we used the results as input to a broader discussion
on news article analysis and framing, such as:
• What main heuristic did you use to analyze the article?
• What procedure did you follow to analyze the framing func-
tions of the article?
• Can you derive any patterns in the way framing functions
manifest in opinion pieces?
3.2 Results of Framing Analysis
In the review session, experts indicated the structure of the article as
the main heuristic to find the framing functions of the main frame.
They also mentioned that opinion pieces are strongly shaped by
journalistic values on how an article should be structured. We then
analyzed this heuristic according to the four framing functions:
(1) Problem Definition : In opinion pieces, the first part of
the article often presents the main problem that the author
addresses and includes the title, the lede, and the first x
paragraphs. Work on manual frame analysis [20] supports
this finding. The number of introductory paragraphs, x, can
be different per source, author, or article.
(2) Causal Attribution + Moral Evaluation : The body
of an article is used to analyze the main problem and usually
contains different factors that contribute to the problem
under investigation and their evaluation. We can match this
with: a) the causal attribution of a frame (forces creating the
problem), and b) the moral judgements (evaluate the causal
attribution and their effect) [12].
(3) Treatment Recommendation : Treatment recommen-
dations can be seen as suggestions to improve or solve the
issue described by the problem definition of the main frame.
They normally appear in the concluding paragraphs, accord-
ing to the focus group members.
This structure, however, is only a heuristic, applying just to opin-
ion pieces. Other types, i.e, interviews, are structured differently.
The results of the annotation session also indicate that each
framing function related to the main frame of an article can nor-
mally be found within one paragraph. Additionally, a paragraph
can include multiple framing functions, but words, clauses, and
sentences generally represent a single framing function.

4 DATASET
The experimental dataset used in our studies consists of opinion
pieces, in Dutch. The choice of article type is motivated by the focus
group session presented in Section 3, in which the structure of this
article type is put forward as the primary heuristic to find framing
aspects. We picked topics that we expected a) to be present on the
Blendle platform at the time when we performed the online user
study; b) to contain different viewpoints addressed in the news; and
c) to balance issues that more current versus long-standing. The
dataset consists of four ongoing topics: Black Lives Matter, Coron-
avirus, U.S. Elections - as more current topics, and the dominance
and privacy issues around Big Tech - as a long-standing topic.
We collected our dataset from an archive containing more than
5 million Dutch news articles. The archive is known to undergo
checks for articles quality, to remove undesirable content, such as
the weather or short actualities. For each topic, we used the search
terms (queries) and restrictions shown in our GitHub repository3.
We provide the list of search terms in Dutch, because we do not
want to add additional bias through translation. Additionally, since
the proposed method heavily relies on the structure of the article,
we set up a filter for the minimum number of words to 450 and a
filter for the minimum number of paragraphs to 5.
Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset, per topic. While the
length of the articles varies across topics, they are usually far longer
than the 450-word limit we chose. Four publishers are present for
all topics: De Volkskrant, De Standaard, Trouw and Het Algemeen
Dagblad. Furthermore, De Volkskrant is the most prominent pub-
lisher for all topics, except for the U.S. Elections topic. The inclusion
of other, less frequent, publishers varies per topic. Overall, our
dataset covers a set of 15 unique publishers.
We also present some properties concerning the presentation
characteristics of the articles on the news aggregator website. We
observe that the ratio of articles that contains a thumbnail image
depends on the topic. For the Black Lives Matter and Coronavirus
topics, more than half of the articles have a thumbnail image, while
the opposite holds for the other two topics. The number of custom
titles from the editorial team and the average title length also differ
considerable per topic. Only a few articles have an editorial title,
and they usually appear for the Big Tech and U.S. Elections topics.

5 VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY METHODOLOGY
We proposed a novel diversification method based on framing as-
pects, using the insights from the focus group. First, we describe
the extraction pipeline, which supports the structure heuristic de-
scribed in the results of the focus group session (Section 3). The
3Search queries: https://git.io/JttZu
pipeline forms the basis for the generation of recommendation lists
that we use in the offline evaluation (Section 6) and the online
study (Section 7). We implemented the pipeline4 using methods
employed by the news aggregator platform and off-the-shelf natu-
ral language processing toolkits, such as the IBM Watson Natural
Language Understanding5 (IBM Watson NLU). We chose to use
state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf methods used by Blendle to en-
sure output quality. Then we describe the distance function, which
combines the metadata related to each framing aspect in a measure
for viewpoint diversity for news articles. Finally, we present the
re-ranking algorithm based on this viewpoint diversity measure.
Our contribution stands in the novelty of the overall diversification
framework, rather than the implementation of specific components.
Figure 1 shows an overview of the end-to-end pipeline.

ticle enrichment, b) diversity functions, and c) re-ranking.
Color coding indicates the four different framing functions,
and color blending is applied where the pipeline contributes
to both causal attribution and moral evaluation.
5.1 Metadata Extraction
For each framing aspect, as described in the definition of Entman
[12], we implemented an extraction pipeline:
Problem Definition . As described in Section 2, the problem
definition can be understood as the central issue or topic under
investigation [23]. Therefore, we decided to use a topic model as
the main extraction method for this framing aspect. The model,
provided by the research partner, at Blendle, included a 1000-topic
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model trained on 900k Dutch news
articles. Based on the conclusions from the focus group described
in Section 3, the title and the first 𝑥 paragraphs are used to retrieve

metadata related to this framing aspect. We also applied multiple
pre-processing steps on the content, including cleaning, chunking,
tokenization, lemmatization and stop-word removal.
Causal Attribution + Moral Evaluation . The causal attribu-
tion of a frame relates to the forces creating the problem, while
the moral judgements evaluate the causal attribution and their ef-
fect [12]. In the focus group session, Section 3, we concluded that
the body of an article usually elaborates on these aspects. Addition-
ally, paragraph-level seems to be the most suitable level of analysis.
Thus, we first translated the news articles in English using Google
Translate and then we applied a text-classification algorithm using
IBM Watson NLU. The service returns a category for each para-
graph according to a predefined five-level taxonomy, from the most
general category (e.g., level 1 - technology and computing), to the
most specific one (e.g., level 5 - portable computer). To extract in-
formation related to the evaluation of these attributions, we also
analyze the sentiment of these paragraphs (in English), using IBM
Watson NLU. Thereby, it would be able to identify if two articles
evaluate the same aspects of a problem differently. The content
of interest for this task includes all paragraphs except the 𝑥 intro-
ductory and 𝑦 concluding paragraphs. We optimize these variables
during the offline evaluation.
Treatment Recommendation . A treatment recommendation sug-
gests remedies for problems and predicts their likely effect [12].
The research domain of suggestion mining, the task of retrieving
sentences that contain advice, tips, warnings and recommendations
from opinionated texts [27], was found to be highly relevant for this
framing aspect [28]. However, the state-of-the-art models are topic-
specific [28], and can not be easily applicable to our domain. Thus,
a more naive rule-based approach was applied for this study, being
more generally applicable. In a crowdsourcing task with domain
experts, we evaluated and optimized the generally applicable rules
from the literature on the news article content. Afterwards, we im-
plemented the method to extract sentences that contain suggestions
from the article content (translated in English using Google Trans-
late beforehand). To obtain comparable information between the
suggestions of two articles, the suggestion sentences were classified
using the same text-classification algorithm as for causal attribution.
According to the focus group discussion, the content of interest
for this framing aspect includes the 𝑦 concluding paragraphs of an
article. We optimize this variable in the offline evaluation.
5.2 Distance Functions
Having defined the extraction pipeline for each framing aspect, i.e.,
problem definition, causal attribution, moral evaluation and treat-
ment recommendation [12], we now define our distance function.
We compare the extracted metadata for every pair of articles. Thus,
we implement a distance function for each framing aspect.
Problem Definition . The metadata regarding the problem def-
inition framing aspect involves a probability distribution over 1000
topics. Thus, we need a statistical distance measure. We chose the
Kullback-Leibler divergence because it is one of the most commonly
used statistical distance measures for LDA-models, and it is used in
comparable work on viewpoint diversification [36].
Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation . We compare the
five-level taxonomy categories extracted from the pipeline described
in the previous section, to obtain a distance measure for the causal
attribution framing function of the primary frame. Thus, we use the
weighted Jaccard index, which measures the similarity (or diversity)
of two sets [18]. The index is calculated for each level of detail in the
five-level taxonomy, such that we apply weight factors per taxon-
omy level. Thereby, overlap in higher levels of detail can contribute
more to the overall similarity score. In the offline evaluation, we
compare different weight factors per taxonomy-levels.
For the moral evaluation framing aspect, we implement the dis-
tance function by multiplying the Jaccard distance and the absolute
sentiment difference between each paragraph combination of two
articles. Thus, paragraphs with no overlapping categories yield a
value of zero, while highly similar paragraphs, with different sen-
timent scores, lead to high levels of diversity related to the moral
evaluation framing aspect.
Treatment Recommendation . For the treatment recommenda-
tion, the distance function is identical to the distance function
related to the causal attribution. Thus, we used the five-level taxon-
omy classification, i.e., from the most general to the most specific
category, as returned by IBM Watson NLU, and the Jaccard index.
5.3 Re-ranking
We implement the re-ranking of the input list of articles using the
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm [8]. In our case, the
re-ranking consists of ranking news articles that are more diverse
higher. First, we normalize the output of the distance functions
related to each framing aspect using a min-max normalization, and
then we combine them in a diversity score through a weighted
sum. We optimize the weight factors during the offline evaluation.
Note here that we re-rank news articles that are known to also be
relevant for the given topic. Where most re-ranking algorithms
for recommender systems order lists only on relevance, the MMR
algorithm provides a linear combination between diversity, in our
case viewpoint diversity, and relevance, set by the parameter _.
Thus, the re-ranking algorithm is defined as follows:
𝑀𝑀𝑅 ≡𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖∈𝑅\𝑆 [_(𝑅𝑒𝑙 (𝑖) − (1 − _)𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑗 ∈𝑆 (1 − 𝐷𝑖𝑣 (𝑖 | | 𝑗))] (1)
In Eq. (1), 𝑅 is the ranked list of relevant articles, 𝑆 is the list of
selected articles in 𝑅, and 𝑅 \ 𝑆 is the list of articles in 𝑅 that are
not yet selected. Since this work proposes a measure for viewpoint
diversity rather than a relevance measure, we implemented the
relevance score (𝑅𝑒𝑙) using a simple frequency-inverse document
frequency (TF-IDF) score. In Eq. (1), the _ parameter takes values in
[0,1], where _ = 1 returns a list of articles ranked only on relevance,
while _ = 0 returns a list of articles ranked on maximum diversity.
6 OFFLINE EVALUATION
In this section, we describe the offline evaluation of our viewpoint
diversity-driven approach for re-ranking lists of news articles.
6.1 Materials
For our offline experiment, we used the news dataset introduced in
Section 4, which covers 214 news articles on four topics.

6.2 Procedure
The experimental procedure consists of four main steps that we
detail as follows. First, we process and enrich all the news articles
in our dataset according to the four framing aspects [12]: prob-
lem definition, causal attribution, moral evaluation, and treatment
recommendations (for details see Section 5.1).
Second, we generate the diversity matrix by comparing all com-
binations of two articles, based on the enrichment described in
Section 5.1. Thus, using the distance function defined in Section
5.2 we measure the dissimilarity of two articles based on the fram-
ing aspects. Finally, since the MMR algorithm re-ranks a list of
news articles based on a linear combination between diversity and
relevance, we calculate the TF-IDF relevance matrix, including a
relevance score for each two article combination.
Third, we optimize the model variables and evaluate the perfor-
mance on the diversity metric in Section 6.3, using cross-validation.
For each article 𝑖 in the dataset, we calculate a set of 𝑠 recommenda-
tions by re-ranking the remainder articles in the dataset. To prevent
over-fitting, we use cross-validation. We split the dataset into 𝑘
distinct sets. We experimented with different values of 𝑘 = 5, 10, 20
and 𝑠 = 3, 6, 9. For every set, we take the following steps:
(1) Grid search of model variables on training set: The training
set contains the 𝑘 − 1 subsets of articles. We obtain the
optimal combination of the model variables for the training
set using a grid search. An overview of the model variables
can be found in Table 2 and in Section 6.2.1.
(2) Evaluation on test set: After the variables are trained on
the 𝑘 − 1 subsets, the model is evaluated on the test set for
different values of _, between 0 and 1 with a step of 0.1. As
described before, for each article in the test set, a set of 𝑠
recommendations is calculated by re-ranking the remaining
articles in the dataset.
And finally, we combined the results of all 𝑘 cross-validations.

optimize during the offline evaluation. We choose the variation of
the weights for each framing aspect such that no single framing
aspect can have the majority. Additionally, a step-size of 0.1 is
assumed to bring enough variation. We consider two variations
for the taxonomy level weights: equal weights for each taxonomy
level or ascending weights. Finally, the number of introductory and
concluding paragraphs can be either 1 or 2.
6.3 Evaluation Metrics
We assess the performance of the viewpoint diversification method
using a metric from literature [36], based on the Intra-List Diversity
metric [36, 38, 42, 43]. It is defined as the average distance between
all pairs of articles 𝑖 and 𝑗 , such that 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 . Thereby, the distance
between a pair is defined by the articles’ channels (predefined taxon-
omy of 20 high-level topics) and the articles’ LDA topic-distribution,
as derived from the enrichment methods in Section 5:
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑖, 𝑗) = 0.5 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑠 + 0.5 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐿𝐷𝐴 (2)
The channel distance is calculated using the cosine distance,
whereas the LDA distance using the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
Additional metrics. We also measure the effectiveness of the
diversification model on other properties, as follows:
Relevance: We measure the TF-IDF relevance for the recommen-
dation lists, such that we can measure the effectiveness of the
viewpoint diversification method.
Kendall’s 𝜏 : We compute the Kendall’s 𝜏 rank correlation coeffi-
cient [19] to measure the similarity between two ranks of recom-
mended items.
Average number of words: We compute the average number of
words for the recommended article lists as a measure of quality (i.e.,
longer news articles can be considered to be higher quality).
Publisher Ratio: We measure the publisher ratio for the recom-
mendation lists because this could potentially provide insights on
the effect of the content diversity on the source diversity.
6.4 Baseline
To assess if the proposed diversification method can increase the
viewpoint diversity based on the presented metric, we compare it
with a baseline, consisting of a full relevance MMR, where _ = 1,
such that we rank the recommendations purely on the TF-IDF
relevance. We chose this baseline because it has minimal effects on
the recommendations in terms of viewpoint diversity.
6.5 Results
In Figure 2, we show the performance of the model in terms of
viewpoint diversity and relevance for different values of _, and the
optimal setting of the model variables (see Table 3 for the optimal
model variables values, per topic). Variations of the cross-validation
variable 𝑘 did not yield significant differences between the results,
and thus, we fixed 𝑘 = 10. The list size 𝑠 did show to influence the
number of publishers included in the recommended list, but the
results were not significant. Thus, we fixed the list size to 𝑠 = 3, to
align with the online evaluation set up, where only 3 recommended
articles can be shown at a time.
Across all topics, the proposed diversification method is capa-
ble of increasing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists.
According to the metric, the viewpoint diversity increases on aver-
age from 0.55 to 0.79 between _ = 1 and _ = 0. Additionally, the
average relevance score decreases from 0.58 to 0.27. In our project
repository,6 we provide examples of ranked lists of articles based
on relevance and diversity, for the topic of Coronavirus.

Kendall’s 𝜏 . We computed the Kendall’s 𝜏 rank correlation to
assess whether the proposed diversification method is capable of
providing different recommendation lists compared to the baseline.
We computed the coefficient between the baseline (_ = 1) and
each other value of _ = [0.0, 0.1, ..., 0.9]. Overall, we observed that
the re-ranking of the set of recommendations based on viewpoint
diversity results in different recommendation lists compared to the
baseline. The coefficient decreases for smaller values of _, but it is
bounded around 𝜏 = 0 for decreasing values of _.
Average number of words. We observe no consistent pattern in
the average number of words for different values of _ across topics.
For the Black Lives Matter and Big Tech topics, the average number
of words increases for larger values of _, for the U.S. Elections topic
the average decreases and for Coronavirus the average is stable.
Publisher ratio. Figure 3 shows the average number of articles in
the recommended lists, normalized by the input ratio, for each value
of _. For every topic, the number of publishers increases for larger
values of _ and the number of different publishers for the baseline
recommendation list is larger than the one in the diverse recom-
mendation list. Thus, we observe that the diversification method
influences the publisher ratio. For small _ values, some publishers
get amplified, while others are excluded.We see this effect primarily
for the topics of U.S. Elections and Big Tech. Coronavirus seems to
be the only exception. We further discuss this in Section 8.1.
7 ONLINE STUDY
We conducted a between-subjects online study on the Blendle plat-
form to compare the reading behaviour of users who receive news
articles optimized only for relevance, versus news articles that are
also diverse on viewpoint.7
7.1 Materials
In the online study, we used the articles collected in Section 4.
7.2 Participants
We selected 2076 active users of the news aggregator platform.
These users were assumed to most likely see and use the recom-
mendation functionality. We included only users who clicked at
least four times on a recommended article below any article read, in
the last 14 days before the study. Groups for baseline and diversified
recommendations were created by randomly splitting the users.
7.3 Independent Variables
In the between-subjects user study we manipulated the following
conditions, referring to the recommended list of news articles:
• baseline recommendation: was implemented using aMMR
that was based only on relevance (_ = 1.0).
7Online study interface and setup: https://git.io/JttGb
484
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Mulder et al.
• diversified recommendation: was implemented using a
MMR that maximized viewpoint diversity (_ = 0.0).
7.4 Procedure
During the two-week experiment, six days per week, we provided
recommendations for two articles featured on the selected users’
homepage. We provided sets of three recommendations below the
content on the reading page of the original article. Every morning,
we chose these two articles manually, to match the selected topics
(Black Lives Matter, Big Tech, Coronavirus, and U.S. Elections). After-
wards, both the baseline and diversified recommendation sets were
calculated for both articles and shown on the Blendle platform.
7.5 Dependent Variables
To analyze the reading behaviour of the two different user groups
and answer RQ1, we measure specific events on the news aggre-
gator platform (i.e., check whether the user opened the article and
if the user finished reading the article). Based on these available
events, we observe multiple implicit (click-through-rate per news
article, click-through-rate per recommendation set and completion
rate of recommendation); and explicit (heart ratio) measures of the
reading behaviour. To answer RQ2, we look into presentation char-
acteristics of the recommended articles (i.e., presence of editorial
title, presence of thumbnail and counting number of hearts).
1. Click-through rate per article: The number of clicks on a news
article is divided by the total number of users who finished one of
the original news articles for which that article was recommended.
The completion of an original news article is registered using a
scroll-position.
2. Click-through rate per recommendation set: The total number
of clicks on either of the three news articles in the recommendation
set is divided by the number of users who finished the original
news article (using scroll-position) for which the recommendation
set was presented.
3. Completion rate of recommendation: Is implemented as the
number of users that read the full recommended article (using
scroll-position) divided by the number of users who opened the
news article. The completion rate is assumed to be a measure for
the user satisfaction with the recommendations. We can argue that
short news articles are more likely to be completed than long news
articles. Thus, we also analyze the completion rate of a news article
in relation to the number of words in the news article.
4. Favourite ratio: The news aggregator platform allows users
to mark an article as a favourite, illustrated by an icon of a heart.
The users can click this icon at the end of the article content. We
implemented the measure as the number of users of the user group
(baseline or diverse) that clicked on the icon, divided by the number
of users in the same group that completed the article. The metric is
assumed to be a marker of user satisfaction with the article.
5. Presentation characteristics:Wemeasured three additional prop-
erties of a recommended article during the experiment, which re-
ferred to the presentation characteristics of recommended news
articles. First, the editorial team can replace the original title of a
news article with a custom, editorial title. In general, these custom
titles are longer and more explanatory than the original ones. Sec-
ond, articles can be presented with or without a thumbnail image.
Third, the number of users who selected the article as a favourite is
visualised by a counting number of hearts in the left-upper corner
of an article banner. All three properties are assumed to potentially
influence the click-through rate and are, therefore, measured during
the experiment.
6. Source diversity: Finally, we also measured the influence of the
source diversity of the recommendation set on the click-through
rate. As seen in Section 6, higher levels of viewpoint diversity
showed to influence the number of times a publisher is included in
the recommendation.
7.6 Results
The online study ran six days a week for two weeks. Thus, we
provided recommendations below 24 articles. During the experi-
ment, the topic of Coronavirus became extremely prominent, so
we provided recommendations below 18 out of 24 news articles on
this topic. In contrast, the Black Lives Matter topic lost all actuality,
resulting in no recommendations for this topic. For the U.S. Elections
topic, we provided recommendations below four articles, and for
the Big Tech topic, below two news articles.
Click-through rate per recommended article. The mean click -
through rate per recommended article for the baseline was 0.11
(stderr. = 0.011) while for the diversified recommendations was
0.087 (stderr. = 0.0083), when looking at all topics. Furthermore,
c.f. Mann-Whitney U test (U=570, p-val>0.05), we did not find a
significant difference between the two user groups in terms of
click-through rate per recommended article (same result per topic).
Click-through rate per recommended set. The mean click-through
rate per recommended set for the baseline recommendations was
0.31 (stderr. = 0.016) while for the diversified recommendations
was 0.25 (stderr. = 0.016) when looking at all topics (Figure 4a).
According to the Mann-Whitney U test (U=2.9, p-val<0.05), we
find a significant difference between the mean click-through rate
per recommended sets for the two user groups. Per topic, we only
find a significant difference for Coronavirus, Figure 4b, with a click-
through rate per recommended set of 0.32 (stderr. = 0.018) for the
baseline and 0.25 (stderr. = 0.018) for the diversified recommen-
dations (U=80.0, p-val<0.05). For the other topics, we found no
significant difference between the two user groups.
Completion rate. We found no significant difference in terms of
completion rate for the two users groups, c.f. Mann-Whitney U
test (U=600.0, p-val>0.05). We also applied the Spearman’s rank
correlation to see whether the completion rate is correlated with
the length of the articles. However, we found no correlation in
either of the two conditions (baseline group: 𝜌=-0.26, p-val>0.05;
diverse group: 𝜌=-0.19, p-val>0.05).
Heart ratio. We found no significant difference, c.f. Mann-Whitney
U test, for all topics and across topics (U=580.0, p-val>0.05), in terms
of heart ratio for the two user groups. Thus, the recommendations
quality was comparable between the two conditions.
7.6.1 Influence of presentation characteristics. We measured the
influence of three factors, namely the presence of an editorial title,
the presence of a thumbnail and the number of users that chose the
article as a favourite on the click-through rate of an article.

Editorial title. Regarding the influence of the inclusion of an edi-
torial title on the click-through rate, no statistical significance was
found for neither user groups, c.f. Mann-Whitney U test (baseline:
U=57.0, p-val>0.05; diverse: U=43.0, p-val>0.05).
Thumbnail image. We found no statistically significant influence
of the inclusion of a thumbnail image on the click-through rate for
baseline users, c.f. Mann-Whitney U test (U=150.0, p-val>0.05). In
contrast, we found a statistically significant difference for diverse
users (U=88.0, p-val<0.05). Recommendations with a thumbnail are
3.1% more times opened than recommendations without a thumb-
nail for diverse users, as seen in Figure 4c.
Favorite articles. We applied the Spearman’s rank correlation
to see whether we find a correlation between the click-through
rate and the number of hearts. Figure 4d shows the distribution
of click-through rates and the number of hearts. We only found a
moderate positive correlation of 0.57, also statistically significant
(p-val<<0.05) for the diversified user group.
7.6.2 Source diversity. As seen in the offline evaluation, higher
levels of viewpoint diversity turned out to have remarkable effects
on the publisher ratio. Therefore, we also evaluated the effect of the
source diversity of a recommendation set on the click-through rate.
For each recommendation set, we computed the number of different
publishers and we found recommendation sets in which all articles
are from a different publisher and sets in which two articles are from
the same publisher. Afterwards, the click-through was calculated
for each category. The results for both the baseline users and diverse
users show that no statistically significant difference can be found
in the click-through rate between two or three different publishers
in the recommendation set for neither baseline nor diversified users.
8 DISCUSSION
We first discuss the results of the offline and online evaluation and
then provide an overview of the limitations of our approach. We
conclude with directions for future work.
8.1 Offline Evaluation
The offline evaluation indicated that the proposed method is capa-
ble of increasing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation sets
according to the metric defined in previous literature [36]. The aver-
age viewpoint diversity scores across all topics increased from 0.55
to 0.79 for an increasing level of diversity in the MMR algorithm.
Simultaneously, the average relevance score decreased from 0.58 to
0.27. Remarkably, the diversity score of 0.41 in [36] is considerably
smaller than the maximum average value of 0.79 found in this work.
A possible factor could be that in [36], the LDA topic model was
excluded from the diversification method to prevent any interfer-
ence with the evaluation metric, whereas the diversification method
in this work still depends on an LDA topic-model. Therefore, the
difference in viewpoint diversity scores between the methods can
possibly appear due to the interference of metadata between the
viewpoint diversity metric and diversification method in this work.
In the offline evaluation, we saw that the publisher ratio decreases
for larger diversity in the MMR (lower values of _). We found that
the maximum frequency of an article in the recommendation lists
is around 2 to 4 times higher at _ = 0, compared to _ = 1. Thus, for
larger contributions of diversity, the algorithm increasingly selects
the same article recommendation. This suggests that some news
articles in the dataset get amplified, thereby suppressing the inclu-
sion of different sources. To study this effect thoroughly, the offline
evaluation should allow for the assessment of the contribution of
individual framing aspects to the global viewpoint diversity score,
per article. These results also suggest caution for very low values of
_, since this may consistently amplify single articles representing
particularly diverse (and potentially more extreme) views.
Although approaches that use source diversity are more popu-
lar, scholars generally agree that viewpoint diversity can only be
achieved by fostering content diversity, because, multiple sources
can still refer to the same point of view [40]. Based on these findings,
this study used a content-based approach. In the offline evaluation,
it became clear that increasing levels of content diversity exclude
multiple publishers and thus, decreases source diversity. Moreover,
some specific publishers got amplified remarkably for high levels
of content diversity. Thus, viewpoint diversification methods could
benefit from considering both content and source diversity.
8.2 Online Evaluation
No major influence of viewpoint diversification on the reading be-
haviour was found, except for the click-through rate calculated
per recommendation set, which indicated a statistically significant
difference between baseline and diverse users of 6.5% (in favour
486
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Mulder et al.
for baseline recommendations). However, the results of the click-
through rate calculated per recommendation indicated no signifi-
cant difference between the two user groups. Likewise, the other
two measurements of the reading behaviour, including the comple-
tion rate of recommendations and the ratio of users who selected a
recommendation as a favourite, showed no significant difference
between baseline and diverse users.
In reflection on the motivation of this study, the proposed diver-
sification for news media is capable of enhancing the viewpoint
diversity of news recommendation, while maintaining compara-
ble measures of the reading behaviour of users. The results thus
suggest that recommender systems are capable of preserving the
quality standards of multiperspectivity in online news environ-
ments. Thereby, situations of extreme low diversity, known as filter
bubbles, could also be mitigated.
These results are in contrast with the most comparable study,
which found a negative effect on intent to read diversified news arti-
cles [36]. The authors proposed a viewpoint diversification method
based on the MMR-algorithm with linguistic features, such as grav-
ity, complexity, and emotional tone. During a user study, 15 partici-
pants were asked to make a forced choice between a recommenda-
tion from the diverse set and a recommendation from the baseline
set, after reading an article on the same topic. It was found that 66%
of the participants chose the baseline article, compared with 33%
who chose the diverse article. However, in the current study, we ob-
served the actual reading behaviour of both user groups and argue
that the present setup holds a higher level of ecological validity.
Additionally, the results shed light on the importance of how
a recommendation is presented. Multiple presentation properties,
such as the inclusion of a thumbnail image and the number of times
an article is marked as favourite, were shown to have a significant
influence on the click-through rate of recommendations. Future
research, thus, should not only address the capability of a model
to enhance viewpoint diversity according to an offline metric but
also evaluate what presentation characteristics could impact the
users’ willingness to read multiperspectival news. Related research
on viewpoint-aware interfaces, which aim to explain the recom-
mendation choices to users [25, 35], and research on interfaces for
cognitive bias mitigation in recommender systems [32] are valuable.
8.3 Limitations
We further discuss the limitations of our approach.
Choice of participants in the online study. Only users who fre-
quently followed recommendations below articles were selected
for the experiment. Thus, the click-through rates presented in this
study are higher than for average news readers.
Limited number of topics and articles. For both the online and
offline evaluations, we used only opinion pieces. Furthermore, each
evaluation had a limited number of topics, namely four, as well as a
limited number of news articles. New topics could reveal additional
results that hold across topics.
Missing user perceptions.While we could study user behavior at a
reasonable scale, a notable omission is users’ qualitative judgement
of viewpoint diversity in the resulting recommendations.We plan to
continue collaborating with the news aggregator platform to refine
the proposed framework, i.e., to improve viewpoint extraction.
Presentation characteristics. Some presentation characteristics,
and in particular the heart ratio, could also be markers of quality.
Further qualitative analysis is needed to e.g., understand how much
of user behavior is directed by quality. We also saw that for some
topics the presence of thumbnail was more common than for other
topics, and it would be relevant to study whether this also interacted
with user perceptions of relevance or quality.
Relevance metric. The offline study could use amore sophisticated
relevance measure between the recommendation and the original
article. The relevance score was based on a simple TF-IDF score,
limited to the terms in a handcrafted search query.
Influence of _. Given limited time for online testing, we only
compared against a maximum viewpoint diversity score.
Influence of publishers. In Figure 3 we see that, although 15 pub-
lishers are represented in the datasets, three publishers are predom-
inant. Due to the limited number of articles and the unbalance in
terms of publishers, the inclusion of a wide variety of perspectives
on a topic can be challenged.
8.4 Future Work
As future work, we plan to investigate further the presentation
characteristics and how they influence user experience, in addition
to behaviour. In more controlled settings, we will study the relative
effects of actual (e.g., as judged by experts) versus perceived qual-
ity (e.g., number of hearts in the interface) of recommended news
items. Future work will also focus on defining a better metric to
measure viewpoint diversity, as opposed to topic diversity, c.f., [11].
Additionally, we learnt that contextual information, general knowl-
edge about a topic (e.g., current measures in place to stop the virus
spread) can also be essential to reveal a specific frame. We hope this
work will encourage further research on defining, conceptualizing,
and evaluating framing in the computational domain.
9 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed a novel method for enhancing the di-
versity of viewpoints in lists of news recommendations. Inspired
by research in communication science, we identified frames as the
most suitable conceptualization for news content diversity. We
operationalized this concept as a computational measure, and we
applied it in a re-ranking of topic relevant recommended lists, to
form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method.
In an offline evaluation, we found that the proposed method
improved the diversity of the recommended items considerably,
according to a viewpoint diversity metric from literature. We also
conducted an online study withmore than 2000 users, on the Blendle
platform, a Dutch news aggregator. The reading behaviour of users
receiving diversified recommendations was largely comparable to
those in the baseline. Besides, the results suggest that presentation
characteristics (thumbnail image, and the number of hearts) lead to
significant differences in reading behaviour. These results suggest
that research on presentation aspects for recommendations may
be just as relevant as novel viewpoint diversification methods, to
achieve multiperspectivity in automated online news environments.
