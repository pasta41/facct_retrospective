ABSTRACT
Environmental data science is uniquely placed to respond to essen-
tially complex and fantastically worthy challenges related to arrest-
ing planetary destruction. Trust is needed for facilitating collabora-
tion between scientists who may share datasets and algorithms, and
for crafting appropriate science-based policies. Achieving this trust
is particularly challenging because of the numerous complexities,
multi-scale variables, interdependencies and multi-level uncertain-
ties inherent in environmental data science. Virtual Labs—easily
accessible online environments provisioning access to datasets,
analysis and visualisations—are socio-technical systems which, if
carefully designed, might address these challenges and promote
trust in a variety of ways. In addition to various system properties
that can be utilised in support of effective collaboration, certain
features which are commonly seen to benefit trust—transparency
and provenance in particular—appear applicable to promoting trust
in and through Virtual Labs. Attempting to realise these features
in their design reveals, however, that their implementation is more
nuanced and complex than it would appear. Using the lens of affor-
dances, we argue for the need to carefully articulate these features,
with consideration of multiple stakeholder needs on balance, so
that these Virtual Labs do in fact promote trust. We argue that
these features not be conceived as widgets that can be imported
into a given context to promote trust; rather, whether they promote
trust is a function of how systematically designers consider various
(potentially conflicting) stakeholder trust needs.

1 INTRODUCTION
It is well known the numerous benefits of trust, for example in
facilitating and sustaining collaborative relationships and enabling
decision making [82, 102, 107]. More fundamentally, however, we
can understand trust as a clever mechanism, the function of which
being to reduce complexity in order to resolve paralysing uncer-
tainty so that one is able to act—or in Möllering’s [111, p. 403]
own words: “bracketing the unknowable, thus making interpreta-
tive knowledge momentarily certain”. Unknowing is intrinsic to
science: we look to evidence to support (or really, the absence of ev-
idence to refute) hypotheses so that we can make confident claims
about our world. Confidence in scientific claims is perhaps uniquely
challenging in the area of environmental science, where competing
values, priorities, and politics are at play [97, 117, 119]. Being able
to make policy decisions that will help arrest planetary destruc-
tion requires trust not only in the scientific findings and resulting
recommendations, but subsumed within this, trust in the people,
processes, and data that led to these findings and recommendations
[12, 119, 141]. The collaborative nature of science and particularly
environmental science also means that scientists themselves need
to have a solid basis for trusting their collaborators, the processes
and data they use, and their findings, in order to make collective
progress in the field.
The turn towards open data and the development of new collab-
orative environments are indicative of the need to foster trust in
environmental data science and its underlying methods, assump-
tions and datasets. The authors of this paper are involved in the de-
velopment of an easily accessible online environment provisioning
access to datasets, analysis and visualisations. In the early stages of
designing this Virtual Lab, it was presumed that well-known trust-
supporting properties would need to be incorporated to achieve
intended trust [71]:
(1) Transparency: providing collaborators access to relevant in-
formation to determine trustworthiness of the items in the
repository;
(2) Provenance: preserving workflow through notebook tech-
nologies integrated with version control (possibly incorpo-
rating blockchain);
(3) Security: balancing openness with some assurance of privacy
for collaborators.
It is possible that these are essential high-level design goals
in promoting trust in some form. But in attempting to envisage
how these might be implemented, and interrogating the purpose
they serve with respect to specific users of the system in specific
64

contexts, we came to understand that these properties which are
so commonly seen to benefit trust are not as unproblematically
associated with trust as the literature would generally have us
believe.
This paper offers reflections, grounded in an extensive trust liter-
ature and informed by conversations and interviews with relevant
stakeholders of this Virtual Lab, on the challenges of simply im-
porting ‘trust solutions’ from other domains. There is neither a
singular solution, one-size-fits-all approach, nor a magic formula to
designing for trust—this is known already, if not necessarily always
appreciated [2, 39, 102]. Where we go further is in problematis-
ing two of the most common ingredients used in designing for
trust, namely transparency and provenance. Our aim is to inform a
more considered discourse on what we are calling ‘trust affordances’,
i.e. designed aspects of systems that promote trust. We hope to
instill a new sensibility about these affordances as being not only
context-dependent, but also fluid and multiply-articulated within
socio-technical systems. This is quite distinct from the predomi-
nant (though implicit) view of such affordances as simple widgets
that can be taken off the shelf and incorporated into a system. By
exploring specifics of how each affordance contributes to trust, for
whom, and then what it would need to look like to promote trust
for this particular stakeholder in context, we show that trust af-
fordances would need to vary in their final form even within the
same system - in other words, rather than being binary or black
and white, there are many shades of grey. Given the collaborative
nature of environmental data science, we follow on from this with
a brief consideration of additional affordances related to the socio-
technical aspects of Virtual Labs. We conclude with some thoughts
about the applicability of these insights to the wider literature on
trust, where transparency and provenance in particular are seen as
almost unquestionably beneficial to trust.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Data Science
Environmental data science applies the tools and techniques of data
science to environmental science problems [15]. Environmental
science subsumes a rich tapestry of sciences, methods, and knowl-
edge of the Earth and its climate. Environmental processes are
often complex, involving non-linear interactions between biolog-
ical, chemical and physical processes across a range of temporal
and spatial scales [33]. The disciplines and sub-disciplines within
environmental science are often fragmented and siloed, with each
having their own languages, methods, conventions and approaches
[16, 43, 61, 114]. There are a small number of ‘big science’ fields, that
are voluminous in the quantity of data but homogeneous in instru-
mentation, format, content and structure and a larger number of
‘small science’ fields in which there are smaller amounts of data that
exhibit greater heterogeneity and variety [17, 150]. Consequently,
there is a variegated assemblage of heterogeneous structured and
unstructured data—not always adequately defined or explained—at
different scales and different levels of veracity, stored in field notes,
local records offices, and archives as well as online repositories
[33, 40, 66, 141, 144].
Given this, accessing data or outputs can be difficult to navigate,
time consuming and, often ineffective [33, 90]. Even with significant
expertise, environmental data is not necessarily straightforward.
Something as outwardly simple and ‘everyday’ such as soil is incred-
ibly complex, uncertain, multi-scale and with impacts on multiple
stakeholders and areas, e.g. food security, carbon capture, and pro-
tection of biodiversity [86]. Similarly, sensors—often assumed to be
inherently objective—can be biased depending on their placement
and other contextual factors [81, 141, 148]. Investigating global
plant data, Meyer et al. [108] found that there are many uncertain-
ties present within the data, and that any filtering done to exclude
these uncertainties would drastically affect the volume of usable
data. They conclude that an opportunity to scrutinise data is needed
in order to be able to make sufficient use of it [108]. In a similar
vein, Pescott et al. [122] state that there is a wide variation in the
quality of environmental data, advocating for improved meta-data
that records assumptions and decisions made with the data pipeline.
An opportunity to scrutinise data and models alongside im-
proved supplementary information are therefore essential mecha-
nisms to enhance scientific research, and even more so when con-
sidering the growing emphasis on multi-disciplinarity and hence
the increase in non-domain experts and non-experts potentially
searching for and using environmental data [44]. This is all the
more important when we view data through a socio-technical lens
[42]. Data is aggregated, processed and then circulated through dif-
ferent sites and practices [8, 58]. Data is not innately neutral, there
are a multitude of judgements, biases, limitations, assumptions
and uncertainties within [27, 42, 99, 134, 151]. Given these com-
plexities, the application of data science to any area is challenging
[102, 121]. However, for environmental data science in particular,
these challenges are compounded [15]. With regards to environ-
mental data science, then, trust is valuable to reduce—but not com-
pletely eliminate—complexity [37, 88, 94, 98, 111]. Particularly for
stakeholders who lack familiarity or face uncertainty [87, 124, 130].
Systems that can therefore encapsulate these components, enabling
collaboration, investigation, and importantly, support stakeholders
to place or refuse trust appropriately are worthy of attention.
2.2 Collaborative Virtual Research
Environments
To address the pressing environmental challenges of the planet, a
holistic approach that consists of collaborative, open and repro-
ducible scientific work is needed [15, 38, 61, 114, 153]. Transdisci-
plinary research, transcending any one field or approach by syn-
thesising different types of knowledge is a promising method for
addressing complex, real-world environmental problems [72, 103].
This includes not only ‘experts’ in the traditional sense, but also
communities outside of academic institutions [7, 44, 89, 97]. Inter-
disciplinary dialogue and practice is needed, but can be problematic
and a site for ‘science friction’ [9, 14, 41]. This has led to calls for the
development of infrastructure to foster collaboration and bridge the
gaps between scientific disciplines, policymakers, external organisa-
tions and agencies, the media, and publics [15, 38, 97, 103, 144, 152].
Virtual Labs represent a means to provide this infrastructure
[25, 71, 86]. Virtual Labs are online research environments capa-
ble of providing access to datasets, analysis and visualisations for
a range of stakeholders [43]. Virtual research environments are
65
Fifty Shades of Grey: In Praise of a Nuanced Approach Towards Trustworthy Design FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
conceptual and thus differ with each instantiation. Within envi-
ronmental data science, there are realisations of the concept, such
as DataLabs [71], the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual
Laboratory [63], and the Environmental Virtual Observatory [43].
Despite the differences in how Virtual Labs may be actualised,
there are some commonalities. They are cloud-based platforms en-
abling users to combine data and modelling software through a
Web browser. Virtual Labs are differentiated from data repositories,
which typically focus on meta-data, provenance, classification and
standardisation [17]. These environments thus incorporate the tra-
ditional features of repositories, but also focus on tools and services,
for instance conducting experiments or including elements of social
networks [10, 63, 156].
Virtual research environments are typically designed with one
specific community in mind, but are available to other stakehold-
ers. By virtue of being accessible through a Web browser, Virtual
Labs are technically accessible to all potential users [43]. However,
open access does not equate to being usable or useful in reality.
To analyse data and understand modelling functions and outputs,
specific skills and knowledge may be required [60]—thus limiting
the use of these environments dependent on ability. When we think
about legislators or members of the public, possessing the tech-
nical skill to use new technologies or traverse a large amount of
evidence should not be taken as a given [56, 140], and thus must be
taken in consideration when designing virtual environments [60].
Implementations that can be taken to accommodate different stake-
holders include environments within the Virtual Lab specifically
tailored to skill levels or user experience [60, 71] and the inclusion
of glossaries and background information [63].
There are various aims and goals for virtual environments, such
as reproducibility and reusability [6, 10, 24, 30, 32, 44, 57, 100]; cross-
disciplinarity and collaboration [6, 24, 44, 57, 71, 115, 156]; accessi-
bility and understanding [7, 44]; transparency [30, 32, 44, 71, 115];
improved documentation and meta-data [158]; interactivity and
usability [25, 44, 57]; interoperability and integration [6]; scalability
[6, 44]; and trust [7, 32, 71, 115, 141, 156]. These are realised through
various functional and socio-technical properties. For instance, flex-
ibility enables users to define and tailor according to their specific
needs. This is necessary in order to address the fact that each dis-
cipline and project is different, and has different norms and needs
[25, 101, 128, 150]. Virtual Labs represent a space which allows for
improved data and software integration, which can often be difficult
and time-consuming on the one hand, and lead to a poor under-
standing and decision-making on the other [6, 64, 128, 144, 156].
However in addition to a purely technical focus, Virtual Labs
are socio-technical, providing space for communication and col-
laboration across organisations and geographical locations [25, 57,
97, 118, 121, 130]. Many of these scientific communities work in
isolation and so technology that can transcend the spaces between
them whilst also including other stakeholders can act as a source
of connection and coordination [43, 102, 121, 158]. This viewpoint
enables us to think about properties from different angles. For in-
stance, usability can be seen as a purely functional or technical
property [6], or as a socio-technical property that should be defined
and enacted in a community-driven way rather than as a top-down
implementation [25]. Features and properties are also interlinked
with others, for instance, usability can be connected to flexibility,
collaboration, and accessibility. Virtual Labs can therefore present
a means to connect these standalone features.
2.3 The Challenge of Trust
This approach, however, is not without obstacles: “a challenge
common to all emerging collaborative environments that promote
open science and the rapid exchange of experimental and pre-
publication data and methods is one of trust” [10, p. 609]. Taking
into account multiple stakeholders and their concerns imports a
consideration of a multiplicity of trusts within the design of Virtual
Labs [23, 74, 115, 141, 145]. For instance, the promotion of trust
is related to: the adoption and use of Virtual Labs; the research
outputs included within the lab itself; and other stakeholders using
the Virtual Lab.
Whilst being theorised in a myriad of different ways, one ele-
ment that is common to studies of trust is an emphasis on evidence
of trustworthiness [22, 28, 29, 84, 91, 94, 102, 104, 107, 133, 142].
Trust is often interlinked with interpretation and quality, and is
commonly associated with the inclusion of provenance information
as evidence of trustworthiness and to aid interpretation and hence
foster trust for data and model consumers [10, 17, 32, 100, 115, 156].
Virtual Labs, as a result of their specific features and properties,
allow for much needed and improved documentation, provenance
and supplementary information [158]. However, given that these
environments are “aimed at serving a variety of user groups that
will include both method development and scientific discovery and
support for decision making in environmental change, it is critical
that results presented are meaningful for all stakeholders involved”
[71, p. 11].
While there are contexts in which these functional and socio-
technical properties have been shown to promote trust, in what
follows we explore the extent to which these properties can be
said to afford trust in Virtual Labs with treatment of multiple stake-
holders. To be able to do so, we must briefly explain our particular
orientation to affordances and define what we are calling ‘trust
affordances’.
3 APPROACH
The concept of affordances is useful to guide the design of technol-
ogy, capturing the relationships and interactions between users and
an artefact [51, 65, 76]. Gibson [53, 54] coined the term affordances,
referring to a relation (action possibility) between an environment
and an organism. Gibson’s conception focused on visual, direct
perception on cues for affordances, that do not change with needs
and goals of an actor. This interpretation is limited when applied to
technology, particularly because not all technological affordances
are directly perceptible [77, 105, 146]. Consequently, affordances
were adapted and adopted within HCI [51, 112, 113]. In this line
of thought, affordances are processed in the brain rather than di-
rectly picked up; affordances are reliant on knowledge, culture and
experience, rather than existing independently; and can be learnt
whereas for Gibson they cannot be [5, 106, 116, 143, 145].
Whilst Gibson focused on utility and the possible actions af-
forded, the focus within HCI has been on use and usability leading
to an over-emphasis on user interfaces [3, 65, 106, 116, 135, 145, 147].
66
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Thornton, Knowles & Blair
When designing trustworthy systems, “the role of systems design-
ers and researchers is thus not one of solely increasing the func-
tionality and usability of the systems that are used to transact or
communicate, but to design them in such a way that they support
trustworthy action and—based on that—well-placed trust” [131,
p. 383]. With this in mind, we take a view of affordances as de-
signed elements that affect not just the human-computer dynamics
(how any given user interacts with the tool) but on broader social
dynamics enfolding through the technology’s mediation.
3.1 Trust Affordances
To develop ‘trust affordances’1 we look to approaches that go be-
yond a limited focus on usability to those that view affordances
as user- and context-specific [3, 93, 138, 146]. One means of doing
this is by utilising structuration theory developed by Giddens [55].
Giddens argues that there is a duality of structure comprised of
human agency and social structure. Social systems are produced
and reproduced recursively between the two. Structuration theory
is beneficial for investigating groups or organisations and has been
applied in work contexts [145, 146] and in online communities
[75]. In the same way that social structures are recursively repro-
duced and may be maintained or changed, every engagement with
technology may see a different structure being enacted, and there-
fore affordances may also be reconstructed over time [120, 146].
Technology is both a product of human actions within a specific
socio-cultural context and a medium for actions due to its mate-
rial and social properties inscribed into them by designers [145].
Additionally, structuration theory allows us to look at technology
being used in ways that the designers had not envisioned, either
through appropriation or enactment [62, 120]. In this way, users
do not use a technology as it was designed, and the structures
within it, but may ignore, work around, or invent new properties
themselves [120, 145]. This lens allows us to understand what the
technology affords users and how ways of using a technology are
instantiated in users’ practice within different contexts and over
time [62, 116, 132, 145, 146]. It also allows us to think about how
affordances can play a different role in the design of attributes of
the same artefact for multiple different users [65, 74, 145].
Recent conceptualisations of affordances, such as social affor-
dances [19, 20], collaborative affordances [5], and organisational
affordances [145] are useful to us in developing ‘trust affordances’.
For instance, the social and cultural context of users can directly
influence how affordances are perceived [5, 20]. And how the con-
ditions of technology, culture, power and interpretation have a
combined influence on the emergence of affordances; and the emer-
gence of a certain affordance can reinforce the conditions or, in
some cases, change them [145]. Taken together, these approaches
emphasise the impact of learning and change on affordances and
that they may need to be discovered from practice, and that this
practice is always situated in a specific and often complex socio-
cultural context [21, 48, 73, 74, 145]. The relationship between the
user, the context and the artefact thus affords a particular action or
activity [18, 145]. Individual users can employ a specific technology
for different goals and have agency in how they use it [36, 48, 135].
1We note that the phrase ‘trust affordances’ does appear within literature (cf. [32, 49,
85, 137]) but has not been formally defined in its own right.
We are therefore cognizant of the fact that however we might define
trust affordances, it is dependent on them being seen as such by
users.
To construct our definition we utilise the criteria for affordances
as set out by Evans et al. [47]. An affordance is something that is:
not solely affiliated with a platform or a feature of a platform; not
an outcome; but does vary (for instance, anonymity, persistence,
searchability, and visibility are affordances but privacy is not as it is
an outcome) [47]. In our specific context, trust and trustworthiness
is the goal or outcome, and there are affordances that reflect the
means through which this can be attained.
Trust affordances are: characteristics of the technol-
ogy by virtue of itself or of features designed into the
technology to promote trust by providing access to evi-
dence of (dis)trustworthiness specific to a user, a tech-
nology and their context.
We proceed in the next section to explore whether and how/not
commonly presumed trust-supporting properties of Virtual Labs
meet this criteria for a trust affordance.
4 APPLICATION OF TRUST AFFORDANCES
Virtual Labs enable certain trust affordances that can shape but
not dictate how people interact with Virtual Labs, with data and
models, and with other users. Properties of Virtual Labs introduce
action possibilities and lend themselves to specific affordances. For
instance, the properties of usability, accessibility and flexibility
draw upon ‘functional affordances’ (usefulness) and ‘cognitive af-
fordances’ (understandability) [65]. Other properties, such as trans-
parency and features such as provenance are often assumed to be
trust-supporting properties—and are assumed to be, themselves,
affordances. But they do not determine how one interacts with a
system, or with others who are also part of the system ecology.
In truth, they imply certain affordances, which as we show below,
do not necessarily or automatically lend themselves to promoting
trust.
Before launching into our examination of how provenance and
transparency relate to trust in the context of Virtual Labs, we must
briefly expand upon the point made within Sect. 2.3 that they are
both delivered via the mechanism of documentation. Documen-
tation is thought to afford trust through visibility, inspectability,
and the provision of contextual information for stakeholders to use
relative to their needs and goals, e.g. functional affordances [65].
Documentation is, at least in principle, beneficial for providing base-
line evidence of trustworthiness. It can be used to ascertain whether
a dataset is appropriate for a users’ needs. This is dependent not
only on the quality of information within any form of documenta-
tion, but as we will show, on how that documentation is designed.
To put it succinctly, there is a difference between information and
useful information.
4.1 Transparency
Transparency is thought to be essential for reproducible science
[139], to enable opportunities for scrutiny [115], and to improve ac-
cess to scientific evidence [71]. But transparency comes in degrees:
if conceived as a metaphorical ‘window’ onto information, the glass
itself can range from invisible to semi-opaque, and the frame can
67
Fifty Shades of Grey: In Praise of a Nuanced Approach Towards Trustworthy Design FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
be the full width of the wall or a narrow aperture. The reason to
carefully vary these parameters is, counter-intuitively, to optimise
visibility of relevant information (cf. [45]). So-called ‘transparency’
has the capacity to contribute to opacity when relevant information
is buried in an abundance of irrelevant information, or when data
is provided in an undigested and unintelligible form. Looking for
detailed evidence can be demanding, hard and time-consuming—
particularly when this evidence is used to judge trustworthiness
[118]. Too little detail does not provide sufficient evidence of trust-
worthiness, but neither does too much [13, 35, 123, 125, 154]. Trans-
parency is well-placed to promote trust, it would appear, only when
it lessens rather than increases the cognitive burden on the given
user to interpret and understand information [67, 79, 126, 127]—
specifically, when users are able to see all relevant data to them and
their goals, but no more than this [82].
Given the existing literature exploring how to afford visibility
through shades of transparency (i.e. translucency), we will focus
our attention in what follows on lesser noted affordances that relate
to realising transparency.
4.1.1 Scrutability. The ability to scrutinise, or the capacity to un-
derstand through examination, is often implied by transparency
[95].Within a Virtual Lab, scrutability is concernedwith the amount
of the system and its features that are shown to users. This requires
careful forethought and a balance between complete openness on
one side of the spectrum, and complete closure at the other end.
Visibility and lack of privacy afforded by transparency may be un-
wanted affordances for some stakeholders [46]. Science, by its very
nature uncertain and experimental, necessitates that certain ele-
ments of research are conducted behind closed doors; as in real life,
so too is it the case online. Credential-based access [46, 71] is one
means of providing security and anonymity for on-going scientific
work and social connections, thus not being completely transparent.
It also allows scientific researchers and others working on multi-
disciplinary projects to have control over what is published within
the Virtual Lab.
On the other hand, designers of these systems might seek to
provide a certain amount/kind of evidence to promote trust in both
the scientific research at hand, in other Virtual Lab users, and in the
Virtual Lab itself. This being the case, one would need to consider
how specific elements are published and made public, and further,
how users can search for or request additional information should
they require. Rather than aiming to be transparent—which is not
always suitable or ideal—a more appropriate ambition might be to
foster a spirit of openness. Openness connotes an ability to engage
skeptically with a system, obtain additional information, and to
scrutinise various elements in determining trustworthiness. The
provision of documentation may already satisfy users, but when
it does not, other scrutability-supporting features are needed. The
ability to ask questions and receive reliable answers can enable
stakeholders to withhold or place trust [23]. This raises certain
questions: what questions do people need answers to and what
evidence (or components) would serve to answer these questions?
More specifically, how can we facilitate the actions of probing
and conversing? And fundamentally, how can designers of these
systems uncover what users’ needs are, given that they may not be
able to articulate them in technical terms?
The ability to scrutinise is necessary for Virtual Lab users, such
asmembers of the public and other groups of external stakeholders—
but only up to a certain point. This affordance requires practical con-
straints to issues raised in our discussion of translucency, namely
the tendency to overwhelm users and undermine trust in the pro-
cess. It is easy to overestimate the amount the amount of times
users are likely to spend scrutinising, which makes it all the more
important that they can find answers to their specific questions
easily. This is not easily resolved given that users inevitably seek
out different confirmatory evidence of trustworthiness.
4.1.2 Abstractability. Virtual research environments have the abil-
ity to “provide very different information types from a single data
set, and to present them in different ways that are accessible and
convenient for the intended user” [44, p. 3]. It is relatively simple to
place all information pertaining to a particular dataset or model on-
line, the challenge rests in ensuring that it is accessible, intelligible,
and assessable [118]. In the co-creation of an environmental virtual
observatory for flooding, Elkhatib et al. [44] conducted workshops
between various types of stakeholders (environmental scientists;
policy makers; local communities directly involved such as farmers;
and the general public) to understand what each different group re-
quired. Within their work, they opted to maintain a user experience
that focused on the environmental questions asked, rather than the
technical questions about how data was collected or how a model
was calibrated, noting that access to these areas is available if the
user wants to, but this is not immediately presented [44]. DataLabs
[71] also enables a range of abstractions, allowing users access to
the same project but dependent on their ability, e.g. users can work
with raw code at one end of the spectrum through to graphical user
interfaces on the other. In addition to this, DataLabs includes the
use of notebooks, which can take the form of tutorials or contextual
narratives that afford accessibility and understanding [71]. This
flexibility and multimediality of information affords users the same
access to the same data and models, and does not limit or exclude
those who may lack programming skills, for instance.
Key to the utility of abstractability, it would seem, is first deter-
mining how this range of information is perceived by those it is
aimed at. This approach aims to codify specific types of knowledge
that are gained through experience, however this is difficult to trans-
fer to others [92]. Who creates these abstractions? Do they convey
what they are meant to convey? Do they enable understanding?
Which formats of abstraction are suited to whom? How and where
is this abstracted information used and how can it be restored if
and when it becomes relevant later on? In short, what should be
abstracted out, for whom, and how do we know it has led people
to the information they need to form well-placed trust?
4.1.3 Reciprocality. In naming this affordance we harken to the
literature on reciprocal design—here, specifically, highlighting the
need for documentation to be tailored to the individual needs of
recipients. Annotation, enabling stakeholders to add to a document
and hence modify it, is one way of achieving this [65]. Annota-
tion can reduce the epistemic load placed onto creators and reduce
the expertise gap between creators and stakeholders [34, 128]. An-
notation further affords trust through collaboration, e.g. a shared
sense of ownership, a sense of adding value or contributing, and
contributes to the holistic research vision for environmental data
68

science. Annotation by other users, such as those who have used
the data and left comments on it, may afford trust in determining
appropriateness, completeness and accuracy. Annotation is also
a way to pose questions or solve uncertainties. Documentation is
predominantly created by those who collected or aggregated the
data or who ran and tuned a model. We should not assume that
those same people can inherently understand all questions held by
others.
Conversation enables the ability to scope, rephrase or ask addi-
tional questions, affording mutuality and responsiveness [59, 67,
110]. Being able to ask questions and receive reliable answers are
well-placed in promoting trust, aligning trustors and trustees ex-
pectations [23, 115]. For instance, a particular user of a dataset can
determine the reasoning of the data producer and how this relates
to the appropriateness of said dataset to their own specific needs.
When the intelligibility of documentation cannot be guaranteed,
features to support additional dialogue are worthy of investment
to promote trust.
Howmight these features afford trust and for whom? Reciprocity
is afforded through communication, the sharing of dialogue, and
the ability to build relationships. Trust is individual- and context-
specific [102]. Therefore we cannot pre-meditatively completely
compile all evidence of trustworthiness for any given stakeholder.
We can generalise, and provide the information we think might be
meaningful, but without a mechanism to address any questions,
the promotion of trust is hindered. Annotation goes some way in
addressing this, with comments left and attached to documents.
But annotation and tagging can be problematic in its own right
(cf. [75]). In addition, then, channels of communication, are required.
Enabling various stakeholders to gain access to the information that
they need in order to be able to place or refuse trust appropriately.
But this too can be fraught with design decisions to be made and
affordances produced. Person-to-person private messaging enables
direct questions to be asked and answered, but are ephemeral and
contained within the specific interaction [45]. On the other hand,
discussion boards enable conversation to be broadcast to others.
This prevents the same question being asked numerous times, but
also introduces the problems of not knowing the audience and
navigating messy threads [18, 45]. Within our reflections, it seems
evident that some form of communication is required, but the spe-
cific instantiation of this is to be determined. We are aware that
channels of communication are already pre-existent for scientists
and academic researchers, e.g. through personal acquaintances or
by virtue of having an institutional affiliation. We believe that these
affordances should be expanded to a wider demographic of Virtual
Lab users to ask, answer, and discuss.
4.2 Provenance
Provenance is slated as critical for assessing authenticity [139],
maintaining integrity in scientific results [100], and (linking back
to transparency) enabling the transparency and reproducibility of
scientific results [30]. But as we saw with transparency, ‘prove-
nance’ varies: basic forms describe the source and lineage of data;
complex forms of provenance describe production processes and
influences such as assumptions or bias [26, 31, 139]. Complex forms
may also be referred to as supplementary information. Spieker-
mann et al. [139] delineate between coarse-grained provenance,
which captures relationships but not complete insight, and fine-
grained provenance, which provides a comprehensive account of
all information pertaining to a dataset or model. Therefore what
is stated as ‘provenance’ is a specific form of provenance in every
case. Cheney et al. [26] also characterise different types of prove-
nance within a database: ‘where’ (e.g. where data has come from?),
‘how’ (e.g. how was an output produced?), and ‘why’ (e.g. why
was an output produced?). Documents can have different values—
for instance, evidential value relates to structure, procedures, and
proving ownership; and informational value refers to the contents
of the document for reference, contemplation and research [67].
Thus when provenance is hailed as a critical foundation crucial to
scientists, which provenance are we talking about? Coarse-grained,
‘where’ evidential provenance, or fine-grained, ‘why’ informational
provenance? The varying granularity of provenance connotes dif-
ferent affordances. The former type of provenance affords insight
into the origins of a particular dataset, model, or outcome. It is
not transparent, capturing the relationships between items but ex-
cluding the complete derivation [139]. In our context, this type of
provenance affords trust when there are issues of legality or own-
ership, as it can be used to ascertain basic facts about a sensor and
its recordings, for exmaple [67, 141]. The latter provenance, which
is fine-grained and informational provides much deeper insight
into these relationships. For instance within scientific research, the
onus is on the contents of any documentation or provenance infor-
mation, including any supplementary details which provide value
[67, 139]. The granularity of provenance is not dichotomous or mu-
tually exclusive, but enables us to consider the affordances between
the types. Coarse-grained may be sufficient for a stakeholder who
wants to see where something has come from, or been used in but
for whom evidence of trustworthiness is not reliant upon seeing
all details. Whereas fine-grained may be useful to a modeller, who
needs a comprehensive account of what has been done, how, and
why in order to have trust in the source and appropriately conduct
their research.
Trust is a judgement based upon available evidence, but may also
rely on many other elements in addition [102]. Approaches that fo-
cus on ‘where’ questions and evidential value only go some way in
affording trust. Evidence of trustworthiness is not prescriptive, and
scientists may rely on approximate evidence and heuristics in addi-
tion to provenance information, e.g. reputation; comparison with
standards; or appropriateness for their needs [50, 80, 118, 149]. The
validity of data is related not only to lineage, but also supplemen-
tary information, such as context and instrumentation [102, 141].
To assess and use data sufficiently, data consumers may need to
look beneath mere provenance records to look at the assumptions
or to answer ‘how’ and ‘why’ questions [8, 26].
4.2.1 Verifiability. Trustworthy data is data that is verifiably ac-
curate, that has evidence of integrity, authenticity and reliability
[81, 100, 136]. It is not purely about the data journey, but the accu-
racy and completeness of the source and the provenance informa-
tion itself [56, 100]. Verifiability can be achieved through identity,
or can be achieved through things such as distributed ledger tech-
nology.
69
Fifty Shades of Grey: In Praise of a Nuanced Approach Towards Trustworthy Design FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
Knowing in whom you are placing your trust enables an in-
dividual to make interpersonally rooted trust assumptions; and
conversely when identity is unknown, assumptions of trustworthi-
ness are based in more impersonal dimensions [28]. Hoffman et al.
[69] propose the use of blockchain for academic published papers
which will enable verification of collaborators’ identities. Use of
distributed ledger technology would also enable data consumers
to know that the record is authentic in what it purports to be and
is free from corruption or tampering [136]. However this has the
potential to be troublesome for sensitive or proprietary materi-
als [30, 155]. Thornton et al. [141] note that the use of blockchain
within academic research could lead to a paradox where evidence of
trustworthiness is provided for some consumers, such as those who
seek quality assurance, but simultaneously lead to disengagement
for others who prioritise the protection of business interests and
intellectual property.
Verifiability is therefore a two-sided affordance, arising from
a tension between privacy and visibility [46]. This tension is ex-
acerbated if we utilise technology, such as blockchain, to retain
persistence and immutability. But then in some cases retaining in-
formation about one’s identity within a system can be beneficial
in supporting trustworthy behaviours (e.g. providing awareness
of and accountability for one’s actions [45], retaining a memory
of past behaviours in the form of a reputation [28]). Potentially
problematically, in a system with multiple stakeholders, it may be
that for some users preserving identity is key to being able to verify
and trust, and for others it inhibits collaboration and reduces trust.
Balancing these issues, then, and deciding on what level of identity
to present in order to promote well-placed trust is highly context-
specific and a system may need to be flexible to accommodate
individual users’ preferences.
4.2.2 Persistence. Within our context, persistence relates to trust
that the data or models will remain in the same content and location,
unless a new version exists (cf. [29]). Effort is required to develop
a persistent infrastructure for artefacts ranging from datasets to
models and supplementary information about them [9]. On the
future of data and its quality, Lord et al. [96] ask whether all data
should be kept andwhat issuesmay arise from decisions undertaken.
The velocity of data is increasing exponentially, and the veracity
of data (in particular environmental science) is often questionable.
Given this, decisions need to made to increase computing capacity
to store all data regardless of its relevancy for future research, e.g.
potential inaccuracies or incompleteness—or do we selectively filter
data before we commit it to a repository? Both approaches may
be unsatisfactory. There are only so many bytes of data, model
runs, and outputs we can store. But on the other hand, we cannot
necessarily decide what may be useful to someone in the future,
and may inadvertantly privilege specific types of information over
others in doing so.
If persistence is deemed important to trust within the context
of a Virtual Lab, there are design challenges related to curation,
archival, and preservation [96]. Not only does the data itself need
preserving in many cases, but so too does associated meta-data, so
as to facilitate trustworthy reuse of the data (cf. [10, 156]). But what
meta-data is useful to a given stakeholder, and what meta-data a
given stakeholder is capable of collecting, may differ greatly; in
which case, how are these trade-offs and potential inconsistencies
resolved?
4.2.3 Traceability. Environmental data may have tangled heredity
and ownership, which may entail more sources than a user is able
to assess at one time [81, 102]. It can be challenging for any user,
regardless of expertise, to assess the quality of aggregated environ-
mental data [4, 15, 50]. Barclay [4] suggests that a gateway (in our
context, a Virtual Lab) can dually: provide traceability, e.g. origins
and reuse of data; and importantly, assist with navigation through
this complexity. For instance, myExperiment [10, 32] facilitate an
infrastructure to ‘bundle’ essential information pertaining to sci-
entific research into workflows. However, workflows can break
[157], and from our own experience workflows can be limiting: on
the inputs and outputs, data accessibility, data sharing, and on the
stakeholders that can use workflows, e.g. external project partners
with limited technical ability.
Traceability, whilst often thought of in terms of looking back,
can also include forward tracing [81]. Scientists can often be reti-
cent in sharing data because of a fear that their data will be taken
and used inappropriately or for erroneous science [141]. The work
on DataLabs advocates for strong supporting mechanisms for trust
when sharing data [71]. Once more, however, this approach is two-
sided. Trust may be afforded for scientists with evidence of the
propagation of their data, but this may be an unwanted affordance
for commercial users of Virtual Labs, who do not want to share
or promote which data they use within their analysis and want to
protect intellectual property [141]. Any solution to this would re-
quire some type of constraint, which Clark [28] argues, nonetheless
cannot force people to behave in a trustworthy way. In the face of
increasing calls for open data, traceability may be suited to some
forms of data or research, e.g. high profile or contentious issues,
but not suited to the majority of research, for which backwards and
forwards traceability would be problematic.
4.3 Making Connections
Following the criteria set out by Evans et al. [47], neither trans-
parency nor provenance are in themselves affordances, but relate
to a number of affordances which can—for some stakeholders in
some contexts—support trust. We have knowingly made a some-
what unnatural separation between transparency and provenance,
as they are intimately connected through these various other affor-
dances. We have tried to demonstrate that affordances may be two-
or multi-sided [74]: the affordances associated with transparency
and/or provenance can be positive for some users but may have
negative implications for others. Furthermore, whilst we have ex-
panded upon six trust affordances, which can all contribute to trust,
we should not assume that they afford trust in all instances or in-
dividually. For instance, reciprocality and scrutability combined
may afford trust, where neither does in and of itself in a particular
scenario.
A mind map (Figure 1) captures part of the complexity in design-
ing for trust. As messy a picture as this already is, we note that it
is incomplete. We have not fully unpacked all of the affordances
related to transparency and provenance (if there even is a bottom
to this well), and these are hardly the only considerations in design-
ing for trust. At a minimum, the map shows that simple recipes
70

Figure 1: Mind map, illustrative of interconnections and tensions within and between affordances relating to transparency
and provenance. Dotted lines indicate concepts we have made connections to without fully unpacking.
(e.g. FAIR represents data management that is Findable, Accessi-
ble, Interoperable, and Reusable [71, 78]) inevitably elide myriad
important design considerations which impact on the resultant
trust.
We are not arguing that transparency and provenance are antag-
onistic to trust—clearly they can be appropriate high-level design
goals. But promoting trust is clearly not as simple as adding a
bit of transparency and a bit of provenance. The affordances that
feed into both are not clear-cut themselves and evidently require
careful consideration of potentially conflicting multi-stakeholder
requirements. It is important to clearly define sub-goals that not
only support transparency and provenance but also support trust
(remembering that one does not guarantee the other), drawing on
various affordances with appreciation of their interdependencies
and tensions. Most importantly, we are by no means suggesting
designing for trust is futile; rather, we are trying to foster a greater
sensibility regarding the delicacy of designing for trust, and the im-
portance of really understanding the requirements of the different
users of the system.
5 DISCUSSION
The design process is fraught with decisions to be made and com-
peting interests to be balanced, which as we have shown, are not
necessarily as simple as they initially appear. Trust is recognised as
being key to the success of socio-technical systems; and because
trust is notoriously difficult to retrofit, how a system will foster
trust needs to considered early and throughout the design process
[82]. By exploring how properties designed into Virtual Labs either
do or do not afford trust, we have illustrated the need for a nuanced
(rather than prescriptive) ‘trustworthy by design’ approach that ac-
counts for how system affordances relate to the specific trust needs
of individual stakeholders. As we have shown, certain features of
Virtual Labs both afford trust and do not afford trust, depending on
the context. The broader lesson in this is to be careful in proclaim-
ing a natural relationship between any particular system property
and trust.
5.1 Trust Affordances in AI Literature
Trust has garnered significant attention within the computing com-
munity, particularly in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. Prevalent
conceptions of trusted AI invoke notions of fairness, accountability,
transparency and provenance. As we have seen above, implement-
ing technology and/or technological artefacts in a way that affords
trust to multiple stakeholders requires careful consideration and is
not an easy task to undertake.
Transparency in particular is leaned on heavily in the trusted
AI community, increasingly instantiated through forms of docu-
mentation [1, 11, 52, 70, 109]. As such, there is much from our
discussion of Virtual Labs that can be applied to trusted AI more
generally. AI documentation across the board is designed (implic-
itly) for scrutability, enabling stakeholders to examine relevant facts
of the AI’s development. There has been much interest in seeking
to enable more dialogic scrutability, for example providing explana-
tions (whether in documentation or via other means) in the form
of counterfactuals [110], which raises similar issues to the ones we
71
Fifty Shades of Grey: In Praise of a Nuanced Approach Towards Trustworthy Design FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
have here about the challenges in predicting the questions indi-
viduals might have. Reciprocality is possibly less universal though
clearly features in IBM FactSheets, which are tailored to specific
documentation consumers [129].
It seems inevitable that some of the subtleties of the various af-
fordances subsumed within transparency arose in designing these
forms of documentation and influenced the particular form this
transparency took. Our point is that it is important not to lose that
subtlety when justifying documentation in terms of how trans-
parency contributes to trust in AI. If and when documentation
succeeds in doing so, it is because its designers have attended to
balancing myriad interconnecting considerations that impact on
trust. Where they fail to promote trust, it is likely due to insufficient
attention to specific multi-stakeholder trust needs. Transparency
should, therefore, always be approached within AI as a ‘problematic
ideal’ [121] that requires great specificity regarding the trust needs
of relevant users and reflection on how designed aspects of systems
might contribute to (or undermine) the fulfilment of these needs.
5.2 Scaling Trust
Many if not all of the affordances described in this paper speak to
interpersonal trust, which requires careful nurturing in ways that
do not necessarily scale as systems become more complex. The
Virtual Labs we have described are relatively small communities:
the infrastructure provided can enable the nurturing of trust at
a project- or team-level. But can these environments scale any
further? At some point, it becomes impractical to individually assess
trustworthiness and one instead must place their trust in the system
itself as having inbuilt mechanisms for assuring trustworthiness
(cf. [83]). Interestingly, this suggests that Virtual Labs, if scaled
up, might entail a rather different set of affordances related to
impersonal (or system) trust.
Our exploration of transparency and provenance affordances—
our overwhelmingly complex mind map (Figure 1) in particular—
also raise more general questions about how much effort is reason-
able to expend in support of trust given how much is involved in
developing systems that enable trust to thrive. Trust really doesn’t
scale well. For example, documentation is costly to create and main-
tain, requiring a high level of manual input [1, 68, 70], as are features
that enable provenance of scientific data [24, 141]. On balance, then,
how important is trust? How do system developers make decisions
about how much trust is enough trust? And how do we approach
the design of a system given these considerations? The trouble is,
problems stemming from a lack of trust are not easily fixed once
they appear—hence the emphasis in the literature on a trustworthy
by design approach [82]. This is not something we can answer here,
but pose it as a question for ongoing deliberation by the research
community.
5.3 Further Trust Affordances
Whilst not the focus of our paper, we note that given the inherent
collaborative nature of environmental data science and the potential
collaborative affordances offered by Virtual Labs, we would be
remiss to exclude a consideration of trust affordances pertaining
to collaboration. These dynamics are complex, but as we have
alluded to in Figure 1, are present within design considerations of
virtual research environments, e.g. collaboration is linked to both
reciprocality and verifiability. Whilst we have not unpacked further
additional trust affordances of collaborative research environments
within our research, this area is one amongst others that we hope
to build upon in future work.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper we have introduced and defined trust affordances,
characteristics of a technology to promote trust through the provi-
sion of evidence of (dis)trustworthiness. Our effort was driven by
our own experiences in designing features within a virtual research
lab for environmental data science—specifically, the realisation that
when trust is discussed, there are certain (often implicit) features
which are assumed to unwaveringly support trust. . . and which end
up being far more complicated in their implementation. In par-
ticular, provenance and transparency are two such features often
presumed to provide authentic, informative evidence of trustwor-
thiness. However when we uncover the complexities of designing
these properties into systems, we find that there are no blueprints
or maps to guide us in enabling said design, and moreover, there
is no clarity on which features actually equate to trust. Given this,
we argue that we should be analytic within the design process,
particularly of the prevailing assumption that designing a system
consists of a sprinkle of one element here, and a dash of another
element there. In reality, a critical understanding of the social re-
alities in which any system is situated is crucial. In the design of
Virtual Labs, we have learnt that provenance and transparency are
useful, with the caveat that these features need to be articulated
in multiple ways in order to contribute to trust and what’s more
we must be cognizant of the fact that when a system is designed
in such a way as to promote trust for one stakeholder, the same
practice may not be promoting trust for another. With regards to
the wider community utilising documentation for the promotion of
trust, in particular data science and AI, we believe that these reflec-
tions can be beneficial to guide the design of systems and features
within these systems. There are different forms of provenance and
transparency that can be taken, and not all roads lead to trust. The
use of trust affordances has facilitated the consideration of features
and systems as-a-whole from multiple perspectives and contexts,
ones which can easily be glossed over. We hope that our work can
enable greater emphasis on the differing stakeholders within each
context and inclusion of additional mechanisms to promote trust.
Ultimately, we want to show that despite the numerous shades
of grey within trust, it is only when we embrace this that we can
design in a trustworthy manner.
