ABSTRACT
Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled ma-
chines to generate cohesive open-ended text when prompted with
a sequence of words as context. While these models now empower
many downstream applications from conversation bots to auto-
matic storytelling, they have been shown to generate texts that
exhibit social biases. To systematically study and benchmark social
biases in open-ended language generation, we introduce the Bias
in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale
dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for
bias benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race,
religion, and political ideology. We also propose new automated
metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and text gender po-
larity to measure social biases in open-ended text generation from
multiple angles. An examination of text generated from three pop-
ular language models reveals that the majority of these models
exhibit a larger social bias than human-written Wikipedia text
across all domains. With these results we highlight the need to
benchmark biases in open-ended language generation and caution
users of language generation models on downstream tasks to be
cognizant of these embedded prejudices.

1 INTRODUCTION
Natural language generation models are the central building blocks
for many important artificial intelligence applications, including
machine translation [16], text summarization [43], automatic sto-
rytelling [42], conversation bots [19], and writing assistants [38].
Given some input words representing the context as the prompt
or trigger, these models generate the most probable sequence of
words in an auto-regressive manner.
Recently, there has been growing evidence on how machine
learning models without proper fairness checks risk reinforcing
undesirable stereotypes, subjecting users to disparate treatment
and enforcing de facto segregation [1, 22]. Although numerous stud-
ies have been done to quantify biases in various Natural language
processing (NLP) tasks such as coreference resolution and word
embeddings [2, 7, 28, 29], there has been limited work addressing
biases in open-ended natural language generation. There are differ-
ent ways in which biases can manifest themselves in open-ended
language generation. Broadly, one can say a language generation
model is biased if it disproportionately generates text that is often
perceived as being negative, unfair, prejudiced, or stereotypical
against an idea or a group of people with common attributes. More
precisely, Fig. 1 shows an example of a negative text generated with
the prompt “On February 4, 2009, Debbie Allen was”. The original
Wikipedia text from which the prompt was extracted is a positive
sentence. If this behaviour of generating negative text is more fre-
quent for people belonging to a specific social group (e.g., women,
African Americans, etc) or an ideology (e.g., Islam, etc) than others
then the language generation model is biased. Given that a large
number of state-of-the-art models on Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks are powered by these language generation models, it is
of critical importance to properly discover and quantify any exist-
ing biases in these models and prevent them from propagating as

unfair outcomes and negative experiences to the end users of the
downstream applications [11, 17, 19, 32, 33].
In this work we propose to examine bias in open-ended language
generation by triggering or prompting language models (LMs) with
seed words matching the distribution of human-written text. Our
intuition is that while carefully handpicked LM triggers and choices
of LM generations can show some interesting results, they could
misrepresent the level of bias that an LM produces when presented
with more natural prompts. Furthermore, LM generations in such
a contrived setting could reinforce the type of biases that it was
triggered to generate while failing to uncover other critical biases
that need to be exposed.
With this central goal, we propose following key contributions.
(1) First, we present the largest fairness benchmark dataset to-date
for evaluating bias in open-ended English language generation,
containing 23,679 unique prompts to study biases in five domains
spanning 43 different sub-groups1. Our LM prompts are extracted
from English Wikipedia articles that represent naturally occurring
texts from diverse writers. (2) Second, to measure biases from multi-
ple angles we augment various existing bias metrics like sentiment
and regard with novel bias metrics: psycholinguistic norms, toxic-
ity, and gender polarity. These metrics are validated to agree with
humans by gathering crowd-worker ratings along each bias metric
using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform.
In experiments, we evaluate biases in open-ended English lan-
guage generation with three common LMs: GPT-2 [26], BERT [10],
and CTRL with the Wikipedia (CTRL-WIKI), thoughts (CTRL-THT),
and opinion (CTRL-OPN) control codes [14]. Results show that, in
general, most of these models exhibit larger social biases than the
baseline of Wikipedia text, especially towards the historically dis-
advantaged population groups. Also, CTRL-THT, CTRL-OPN and
GPT-2 more frequently generate texts that are polar along the bias
metrics compared to BERT and CTRL-WIKI. These results highlight
the importance of studying the behaviour of language generation
models before being deployed with various downstream tasks.
2 RELATEDWORK
Much recent work focuses on exposing and quantifying NLP model
biases that reflect known harmful aspects of human culture, nega-
tive stereotyping, and inadvertent group segregation [1, 8, 22].
1https://github.com/jwaladhamala/BOLD-Bias-in-open-ended-language-generation
The seminal work in [2] exposed gender bias in pre-trained word
embeddings and provided a bias metric capturing gender bias as a
magnitude of the projection of gender-neutral words onto the gen-
der subspace. Another work [7] inspired by the Implicit Association
Test defines bias as harmful negative stereotypes in human culture
and provides a metric based on a permutation test between words
from target study group and stereotype attribute groups. Many re-
cent works propose new datasets to expose the difference in model
behavior for counterfactual examples from different groups. For
example, Rudinger et al. [28], Zhao et al. [44] designed the Wino-
gender schema to study the behaviour of co-reference resolution
models in associating gender-neutral occupations with a specific
gender. Webster et al. [39] proposed the GAP dataset that contains
sentences mined from Wikipedia to expose the performance gap
between populations belonging to different gender groups. The
Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC) [15] presents a dataset to measure
the difference in the intensity of sentiments predicted by sentiment
analyzers across various gender and racial groups.
Closely related to our work is a study in [30] that showed that
GPT-2 is biased towards generating text with lower sentiment and
regard scores when prompted with contexts associated with certain
groups. This study consists of a manually curated dataset with 60
unique text generation prompts. Sheng et al. [31] further showed
that adversarial triggers [36] can be used to control biases in lan-
guage generation. Concurrent with our work, Nadeem et al. [24]
presented a dataset, StereoSet, with 17,000 sentences that measure
an LM’s preference for texts expressing stereotypes. StereoSet was
collected by first curating a set of identifier tokens; for example, him,
wife, etc for the gender domain. Crowd workers are then asked to
provide a stereotypical, an anti-stereotypical, and a neutral sentence
containing the target token. The paper evaluates the probability
that an LM ranks a stereotypical sentence higher than the unbiased
sentence. Nangia et al. [25] presented a dataset, similar in spirit
to the StereoSet, with 1,508 sentence pairs in which one sentence
is more stereotypical than other. The paper measures the degree
to which a masked LM prefers the stereotypical sentence over the
unbiased sentence. Both the dataset and evaluation metrics in [24]
and [25] are fundamentally different from the work presented here.
BOLD consists of language generation prompts extracted from
Wikipedia sentences. Instead of measuring the probability that an
LM chooses a stereotypical text over an unbiased text, our metrics
directly measure social biases in the generated texts.
3 BOLD: BIAS IN OPEN-ENDED LANGUAGE
GENERATION DATASET
Existing approaches typically collect prompts from experts or crowd-
workers [24, 30]. This may pose a challenge in collecting prompts
that accurately reflect the diversity and structure of text beginnings
that text generation models are subjected to. Wikipedia is an online
free-content encyclopedia continuously written and reviewed col-
laboratively by a large number of volunteers. Because it provides
articles from many domains and demographics, represents authors
from diverse background, and contains a quality control procedure,
we take English Wikipedia as a source for gathering prompts [40].
This section describes the generation process and statistics of BOLD.

3.1 BOLD statistics
We study fairness across major sub-groups that compose each of the
following demographic domains: profession, gender, race, religious
belief, and political ideology. Throughout the paper we refer to indi-
vidual sub-groups within the larger demographic domain as simply
“groups”. We restrict groups within each domain as follows. For
profession, we take occupational categories from Wikipedia2. For
gender, we consider males and females. To avoid the confounding ef-
fect of profession on gender, we use only male and female actors for
gender-based prompts. In the race domain, we consider European
Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino / His-
panic Americans. Based on Wikipedia’s list of political ideologies,
we consider socialism, populism, nationalism, liberalism, fascism,
democracy, conservatism, communism, anarchism, left-wing, and
right-wing3. We include political ideology like fascism to under-
stand how texts generated for political ideologies in the extreme
end compare to texts generated for moderate political ideologies;
fascism group is not included to interpret negative generations with
fascism prompt as a bias. Similarly, based on Wikipedia’s list of
religious and spiritual beliefs4, we take the most commonly adopted
religious beliefs in the world: Sikhism, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism,
Christianity, Buddhism, and Atheism. Table 1 shows the statistics
of BOLD.
3.2 BOLD collection
From here, we collect English prompts from Wikipedia as follows.
For each domain, we identify a list of Wikipedia pages correspond-
ing to appropriate groups for that domain. For instance, we take
groups for the profession domain from https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Lists_of_occupations. Next, for each group, such as arts &
entertainment, we scrape the Wikipedia pages for each occupation
under that umbrella. However, we do not take all sentences on the
scraped page. For each profession, we only take sentences where
the profession is mentioned in the first 8 words of the sentence. This
is so that we can truncate the sentence in order to get the prompt.
The prompt is taken to be the first five words plus the profession /
name / religious belief / political ideology term. Therefore, prompts
in BOLD have six to nine words depending on the domain and
group. Table 2 provides some examples of prompts in BOLD.

3.3 BOLD post-processing
Wikipedia pages do not always link to pages that are relevant to the
group attribute under consideration. For example, a Wikipedia page
about the Statistician profession may contain sentences or link to
pages describing Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also some Wikipedia
pages have texts that are incomplete or not relevant to the group
attribute. Therefore, we post-process and clean texts extracted from
Wikipedia as follows. Since we compare LM generations with orig-
inal Wikipedia sentences, we filter out Wikipedia sentences that
are too short (≤ 8 words). In the gender and the race domains, a
prompt belongs to a specific group based on the gender or the race
of the person’s name present in that prompt. Therefore, in these
domains we use the named entity analyzer from NLTK [21] to filter
out sentences that do not contain a person’s name.
During metrics calculation we use anonymize the prompts by
replacing the names of people in the gender and race domains
with "Person" and replacing names of professions and religious or
political groups such as Christianity, Nurse, Scientist, Buddhism,
Socialism, Communist, etc with "XYZ". This is to avoid incorporat-
ing the bias that an evaluation metric or human annotators may
have towards the person or the ideology under study. It should be
noted, however, that the prompts may still contain some words that
are indirectly related to the group attributes.
4 EVALUATION METRICS
Text generation models may display societal biases in various forms.
To capture and study biases in generated texts from multiple an-
gles, we propose different bias metrics. Prompts from gender, race,
religious belief, and political ideology domains trigger a text gener-
ation model to generate text given a context referring to a person
or an idea. In these cases, we are interested in examining the posi-
tive or negative feelings in the generated texts. Hence, we propose
sentiment, toxicity, regard, and emotion lexicons as the metrics.
Studies in word embedding models have uncovered a gender bias in
associating gender neutral professions with a specific gender [2, 7].
Therefore, in the profession domain we propose metrics that mea-
sure the polarity of a text towards the male or the female gender.
4.1 Sentiment
Sentiment analysis is commonly used to analyze sentiments in a
customer’s reviews or opinions in social media [13, 23]. Here, we
evaluate the sentiments conveyed in the texts generated by an LM
when prompted with seed words representing certain group in a
864
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Dhamala and Sun, et al.
domain. We use the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Rea-
soner (VADER) which computes the sentiment score of a text by
first taking word-level valence-based lexicons and then combining
the lexicon polarity with rules for text context awareness [13]. For
each text, VADER produces a score in a range of [−1, 1] where −1
represents a negative sentiment and 1 represents a positive senti-
ment. Using some texts with known sentiment label, we determine
a threshold of ≥ 0.5 and ≤ −0.5 to classify texts as conveying
positive and negative sentiments respectively.
4.2 Toxicity
A text is considered toxic if the language it conveys is disrespectful,
abusive, unpleasant, and/or harmful. We take a BERT model that
was fine-tuned on a toxic comment classification dataset5 to classify
a text into multiple labels: toxic, severe toxic, threat, obscene, insult,
and identity threat. In the final metric, we label a text to be toxic if it
is classified into either of the six labels. Additional implementation
details are provided in the Appendix.
4.3 Regard
Sheng et al. [30] noted that sentiment and language polarity may
not always directly correlate with bias, and defined regard, a metric
that directly measures human-annotated bias by measuring polarity
towards a demographic, rather than overall language polarity. They
train a BERT model on human-annotated samples across gender
(female, male), sexual orientation (gay, straight), and race (White,
Black). These samples were curated by using GPT-2 to complete
sentences that start with a certain set of bias templates for each
demographic. We use this classifier6 to evaluate regard on the
generated text. Since the regard classifier was only trained on a few
groups, we limit calculation of this metrics to gender (female, male)
and race (European American, African American) groups .
4.4 Psycholinguistic norms
Some texts may invoke positive emotions like happiness, love, joy
and, success, whereas others may invoke negative emotions like
sadness, anger, disappointment, and fear. To explain the underlying
basic text emotions that accumulated to an overall positive / nega-
tive / neutral sentiment or toxicity for a given text we propose using
text-level psycholinguistic norms. At the word-level, psycholinguis-
tic norms are numeric ratings assigned by expert psychologists to
words to measure the affective meaning conveyed by each words
along various dimensions. Commonly eight dimensions are con-
sidered as the foundation of emotion states: Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance (collectively known as VAD [3]); and Joy, Anger, Sad-
ness, Fear, and Disgust (collectively known as BE5 [4]). Variables
in VAD use a scale of 1 to 9 with 5 representing neutral, and vari-
ables in BE5 use a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 representing neutral.
Given a set of seed words with scores along VAD and BE5 variables
labeled by psychologists there are two components to extending
these scores to text-level. First, lexicons should be extended to cover
a larger vocabulary of words. Second, word-level lexicons should
be aggregated to obtain a text-level lexicon. To extend lexicons to a
larger vocabulary we use the method in [6] that trains a multi-task
5https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge
6https://github.com/ewsheng/nlg-bias
learning feed-forward network with FASTTEXT word embedding
vectors to predict lexicons of unknown words [5]. To aggregate
lexicons of each word and compute text level norms we compute
the weighted average as follows:∑𝑛
𝑖=1 sgn(𝑤𝑖 )𝑤2
𝑖∑𝑛
𝑖=1 |𝑤𝑖 |
,
where𝑤𝑖 represents the word-level lexicon value and 𝑛 is the num-
ber of words used during this aggregation. During text-level psy-
cholinguistic norm calculation, we do not include lexicons from
words that belong to certain parts of speech like pronoun, prepo-
sition, and conjunction that do not convey any emotion. For ease
of interpretation, we scale variable in VAD to [−1, 1] with 0 repre-
senting neutral and BE5 to [0, 1] with 0 representing neutral.
4.5 Gender polarity
We propose two types of gender polarity metrics. Our first gender
polarity metric (termed unigram matching) counts the total number
of male and female specific tokens in the text. Following current
literature that studies gender bias in models [2, 34], we obtain a
list for male and female identifying tokens as: male tokens he, him,
his, himself, man, men, he’s, boy, boys and female tokens she, her,
hers, herself, woman, women, she’s, girl and girls. A text is identified
as expressing male gender if the count of male words in the text
is larger than the count of female words. If both counts are zero,
the text is labelled as neutral. While this metric can account for the
direct presence of gendered words in the text it does not account
for words that may be indirectly related to a gender.
We propose a second gender polarity metric to take into account
the presence of words in the text that are indirectly related to a
gender. It is based on Bolukbasi et al. [2] which identifies that the
normalized projection of a word vector into the gender direction
defined by ®𝑠ℎ𝑒 - ®ℎ𝑒 is closer to 1 if the word is closer to ®𝑠ℎ𝑒 and
closer to −1 if the word is closer to ®ℎ𝑒 in the word embedding space
and shows that a word-level gender classifier based on this metric
has a good approximation with human annotations of word-level
gender. With this finding, we define our second text-level gender
polarity metric as follows. To avoid inheriting the gender biases in
professions existing in a word embedding we use the hard debiased
Word2Vec embedding7. On this word embedding space, we first
compute the gender polarity of each word ®𝑤𝑖 in the text as follows:
𝑏𝑖 =
®𝑤𝑖 .®𝑔
| | ®𝑤𝑖 | | | ®𝑔 | |
,
where ®𝑔 = ®𝑠ℎ𝑒 − ®ℎ𝑒 . If ®𝑤𝑖 is female-aligned then 𝑏𝑖 is close 1, if
®𝑤𝑖 is male-aligned then 𝑏𝑖 is close to −1, and if ®𝑤𝑖 is neutral then
𝑏𝑖 = 0. Next, we aggregate the word-level gender polarity scores
𝑏𝑖 and obtain a continuous score indicating the gender polarity of
the entire text. A simple approach to aggregate word-level scores
is averaging. However, since a text in general has a larger number
of neutral words than gender polar words it tends to skew the
gender polarity of the text towards neutral. Hence, we propose two
alternative ways to aggregate word level gender polarity scores
that apply a larger weight to the scores from gender polar words.
First, we propose to weight all word-level gender polarity scores
7https://github.com/tolga-b/debiaswe
865
BOLD: Dataset and Metrics for Measuring Biases in Open-Ended Language Generation FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
𝑏𝑖 by their magnitude and take a weighted average (termed as
Gender-Wavg).
Gender-Wavg =
∑𝑛
𝑖=1 sgn(𝑏𝑖 )𝑏2𝑖∑𝑛
𝑖=1 |𝑏𝑖 |
.
Second, we propose to take the score from the most gender polar
word in the text (termed as Gender-Max for the rest of the paper).
𝑖∗ = argmax
𝑖
( |𝑏𝑖 |),
Gender-Max = sgn (𝑏𝑖∗ ) |𝑏𝑖∗ |.
Once a global score is computed we take a threshold of ≤ −0.25
to classify a text as expressing the male gender and a threshold
of ≥ 0.25 to classify a text as expressing the female gender. These
thresholds are determined empirically by computing gender polar-
ity scores on a few texts with known gender labels.
5 GENERATINGWITH LANGUAGE MODELS
We trigger an LM to generate texts with prompts from BOLD as
a sequence of seed words. In this study, we include multiple LMs
that differ in their training strategy and training corpora. Below
are the LMs used in this paper.
5.1 BERT
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
trains deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by
jointly conditioning on both left and right context [10]. BERT is
pre-trained using English Wikipedia and BooksCorpus [45]. In our
task, we use a pre-trained BERT model for filling in the next set
of words given a prompt consisting of a set of seed words from
Wikipedia [37].
5.2 GPT-2
Unlike BERT, GPT-2 is a transformer-based LM that is trained with a
causal language modeling objective: predicting the next word given
a sequence of previous words in an auto-regressive manner [27].
GPT-2 was pre-trained on the WebText dataset that was collected
by scraping and filtering web pages from sources such as Reddit.
5.3 CTRL
CTRL is a conditional transformer-based LM that is trained to condi-
tion on control codes to govern the style, content, and task-specific
behaviour [14]. Control codes are derived from naturally occurring
structure in raw text and provide control over text generation by
helping to predict which part of the training data is more likely
given a sequence. In this study, we use CTRL LMwith three different
control codes:
(1) CTRL-WIKI uses the Wikipedia control code
(2) CTRL-THT uses the Thought control code
(3) CTRL-OPN uses the Opinion control code
Each control code can be traced back to a particular subset of
training data. The Wikipedia control code traces back to English
Wikipedia. The Opinion and Thought control codes trace back to
sub-reddits r/changemyviews and r/showerthoughts respectively.
6 EXPERIMENTS
For language generation experiments, we use the HuggingFace
library [41]. We provide model implementation details in the Ap-
pendix. In this section, we first evaluate various LMs with regards to
the different types of biases present in the texts that they generated
and compare with a baseline of bias present in the texts extracted
from Wikipedia. These evaluations are done with automated met-
rics described in Section 4.
Next, by collecting crowd workers’ annotations on a subset of
data we validate that the presented automated metrics align well
with human annotations.
6.1 Bias across groups in each domain
BOLD contains prompts that trigger text generation from various
demographic groups that compose profession, gender, race, reli-
gious belief and political ideology domains (see Table 2). In each
domain, some groups may be more frequently associated with neg-
ative emotions than others when an LM generates text. In this
section, we examine biases in generated texts towards different
demographic groups in each domain.
6.1.1 Profession. Table 3 shows the proportion of texts that were
classified as male or as female with Gender-Max, Gender-Wavg,
and unigram matching metrics across various professions and data
sources. This categorization of profession was obtained by merg-
ing a set of granular professions as follows: arts & entertainment
includes dance, film and television, entertainer, writing, artistic,
and theater; science & technology includes engineering, computer,
and scientific; industrial & manufacturing includes metal work-
ing, industrial, and railway industry; and healthcare & medicine
includes healthcare, nursing, and mental health. Only 6.57% of total
texts across all professions are classified as either male or female.
This is because the prompts were extracted fromWikipedia articles
without any constraint that will force an LM to generate gender
polar texts. The proportion of texts classified as female is higher in
healthcare & medicine group across all metrics and data sources
(Table 3 bold), whereas the proportion of texts classified as male is
higher in the majority of the remaining profession groups. Fig. 2
shows the proportion of texts classified as male minus the propor-
tion of texts classified as female with the Gender-Max metric in a
granular profession level across all text sources. It again shows that
most of the professions such as writing, science, art, and engineer-
ing are skewed towards the male gender (male - female proportion
> 0). Only the nursing is skewed towards the female gender (male -
female proportion < 0). The rest of the professions show a mixture
of male and female majority across data sources.
6.1.2 Gender. Fig. 3a shows the proportion of texts classified as
having positive, neutral, and negative sentiments across male and
female genders. Overall, 76.72% of total texts were classified as
having neutral sentiments. The proportion of texts with positive
sentiment was larger for female (male: 0.17041, female: 0.17763,
p-value in binomial proportion test: 0.204) and the proportion of
texts with negative sentiment was smaller for female (male: 0.069,
female: 0.047, p-value<0.01) showing a (negative) bias in sentiment
scores towards the male population. Table 4 presents the differences
in the proportions of male and female texts that are classified to

of texts generated with male prompts are classified as containing
negative emotions like anger, sadness, fear, and disgust (> 0 scores

of texts generated with female prompts are classified as containing
positive emotions like joy and dominance (+ve) (< 0 scores in Table

analysis results in which smaller proportion of texts generated with

group. Both the proportion of texts with negative sentiment (African:
0.08154, Asian: 0.04917, European: 0.07484, Hispanic/Latino: 0.06958,
chi-square test p-value < 0.001) and toxicity was largest for the
African American group (Africa: 0.00297, Asian: 0.00077, European:
0.00193, Hispanic/Latino: 0.00162, chi-square test p-value < 0.001).
We see in Table 5 that the positive regard for the European Amer-
ican group is equal or larger than that for the African American
group in five out of six models. Similarly, the proportions of texts
with negative regard for African American groups is marginally
larger in five out of six models. This results shows a consistent bias
against the African American group across all three metrics.
6.1.4 Religious beliefs and political ideologies. Fig. 4 shows the
result of sentiment analysis for various religious and spiritual ide-
ological groups. On average over all data sources, the proportion
of texts with negative sentiments is highest for Atheism (13.21%)
followed by Islam (10.39%). It is lowest with Hinduism (1.38%) and
Buddhism (3.85%). Note here that Hinduism is underrepresented
in BOLD with only 12 prompts. Next, we pick two most widely
adopted religious beliefs: Christianity and Islam to dive deep and
compare results on psychologinguistic norms. Table 6 presents the
proportion of texts from the Christianity group minus the propor-
tion of texts from the Islam group that were classified into different
VAD and BE5 variables. As shown, a larger proportion of texts gen-
erated with Islam prompts were labelled as conveying emotions like
sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and valence (-ve) (indicated by negative
values in Table 6), while a larger proportion of texts generated from
the Christianity prompts were labelled as having emotions like
joy. This suggests a negative bias towards Islam religious belief in
terms of psycholinguistic norms. In terms of toxicity, only prompts
with Islam, Christianity, and atheism resulted in toxic texts among
which atheism had the largest proportion (0.574%).
Finally, Fig. 5 shows sentiment analysis results on the political
ideology domain. Among all ideologies considered proportions of
texts with negative sentiment was largest for fascism across all
models. However, proportions of texts with positive sentiment are
not the smallest in fascism across all models. This is undesirable
and users of text generation models should consider treatments
that handle LM generations for extremist ideologies appropriately.
We provide detailed results in terms of psycholinguistic norms in
the Appendix.
6.2 Comparison of language generation models
Gender polarity metrics. In texts from Wikipedia, the proportion
of texts classified as male is larger that the proportion of texts classi-
fied as female in the arts & entertainment and science & technology
groups. Conversely, the proportion of texts classified as female
is larger in industrial & engineering and healthcare & medicine
groups. Texts generated by LMs show a similar trend across all
profession groups except in industrial & manufacturing, in which
WIKI, BERT and CTRL-OPN have larger female proportion but
GPT-2, CTRL-WIKI and CTRL-THT have larger male proportion.
The average of male to female proportions of texts across all profes-
sion groups for WIKI, BERT, GPT-2, CTRL-WIKI, CTRL-OPN and
CTRL-THT are respectively 2.29, 1.25, 3.18, 2.94, 1.85 and 2.15. This
shows that GPT-2 has the largest male to female ratio and BERT
has the smallest.
Regard. As shown in the bolded values in Table 5, proportions of
texts with positive regard is highest in texts from Wikipedia. Pro-
portions of texts with negative regard is higher in texts generated
by either GPT-2 or CTRL-OPN. We find that there is a difference in
the proportions of texts with positive regard generated by CTRL-
THT, CTRL-WIKI, CTRL-OPN, and GPT-2 models (chi-square test,
p-value < 0.0002).
Sentiments. Both the proportion of texts with positive sentiment
and with negative sentiment are larger in texts that are generated
by CTRL-OPN or CTRL-THT, while both proportions are smaller in
texts that are generated by BERT in the gender domain (see Fig. 3
a). A chi-square test on the proportions of positive and negative
sentiments in texts generated by various LMs in the gender domain
showed that these proportions are not the same (p-value< 0.001).
This trend is common across rest of the domains (Fig. 4 and 5).

Figure 5: Proportions of texts classified as expressing positive, neutral, or negative sentiments for different groups in political ideologies.
Top and bottom bars respectively represent positive and negative sentiments.
Toxicity. Compared to the proportions of texts with negative or
positive sentiments, only a small fraction of texts generated by any
LM or extracted from Wikipedia were classified to be one of the
toxic categories (< 0.5% of total data across all data sources and
domains). One reason for this could be that LMs and Wikipedia
do not generate highly polar texts unless explicitly triggered to
do so. Another reason could be because the toxicity classifier was
trained on a social media dataset which is not similar to BOLD.
Similar to sentiment scores, larger proportion of texts generated by
CTRL-OPN, CTRl-THT, and GPT-2 were classified to be toxic than
the texts fromWikipedia, BERT, and CTRl-WIKI (Fig. 3). In religious
belief domain, CTRL-THT, and CTRL-OPN models generated one
toxic text each with prompts from the Islam, the Christianity and
the atheism group. Similarly in political ideology domain, BERT
generated a toxic text with communism prompt, CTRL-OPN gener-
ated a toxic text with fascism prompt, and CTRL-THT generated a
toxic text each for socialism and communism prompts.
Overall, CTRL-THT, CTRL-OPN, and GPT-2 generated texts that
were more polar across gender polarity, sentiments, toxicity and
regard than BERT and CTRL-WIKI. This could be because CTRL-
THT and CTRL-OPN are trained on social media data that reflect
people’ opinions or thoughts, whereas CTRL-WIKI and BERT are
trained onWikipedia data. Table 7 presents various examples of LM
generations that contained negative sentiments, negative regard,
toxicity and gender polarity.
6.3 Validation with human annotated metrics
To validate if automatic metrics align well with the human judge-
ment of sentiment, toxicity, and gender polarity, we collect ratings
from crowd workers via AMT. We conduct three AMT experiments
one each for the validation of sentiment, toxicity, and gender polar-
ity metrics. To validate gender polarity metrics, we take a random
sample of data consisting of 1,020 texts from the profession domain,
and ask crowd workers to label whether each text conveys male, fe-
male, or neutral gender. Similarly, to validate the sentiment metric,
we take a random sample of data consisting of 1,960 texts from the
gender domain and ask crowd workers to label each text as con-
veying positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Finally, to validate
the toxicity metric we take a random sample of data consisting of
152 texts from the gender domain and ask crowd workers to label
each text as toxic or neutral. The data sampled for all experiments
consisted of texts from all data sources: Wikipedia, BERT, GPT-2,
CTRL-WIKI, CTRL-THT, and CTRL-OPN. Also, as shown in Fig. 6
these samples contain texts whose automated metric scores span

the entire feasible range of each metric’s value. To avoid any inher-
ent sentiment or toxicity bias that annotators may have towards
the person mentioned in the prompt, we anonymize all texts. Simi-
larly, we redact names of political ideologies, religious beliefs, and
professions from all texts before collecting annotations.
We determined the setup of our AMT experiments by conducting
pilot studies with AMT sandboxes and a set of AMT experiments.
We chose a final setup in which one task consists of annotating
ten texts. Appendix details our experiment guidelines and Fig. ??
illustrates a user interface implemented for collecting annotations
in the profession domain. A similar interface was used for the
rest of the experiments. Based on the average time taken during
pilot studies, we set a target payment rate of USD 12/hour. After
the study was concluded, we dispensed additional payment via
bonuses based on the actual annotation times to ensure that all
workers working at an average pace received an equivalent of
USD 12/hour; this surpassed USD 15/hour for median pace. Since
prompts are extracted from the Wikipedia and we compare the
fairness of generated texts with Wikipedia sentences, we restrict
the country of crowd workers to United States, Great Britain or
India which were countries with the highest number of page views
to the English Wikipedia8. Additionally, we only allowed crowd
workers with a HIT approval rate greater than or equal to 98 and
with masters granted by AMT. We also ensured that no personal
identifying information about crowd workers was solicited and any
trace of annotator information including worker-ids were deleted
post annotation. Each text in our AMT experiments is shown to
at least three crowd workers and only those labels are accepted
that have a majority agreement on the chosen label. In overall,
there were 50 unique annotators. After crowd worker ratings are
collected, we assign labels to the labeled nominal values as follows:
male = -1, female = 1, positive sentiment = 1, negative sentiment =
-1, neutral sentiment = 0 and toxic = 1, neutral = 0.
To compare automatic and human annotated metrics, we com-
pute the following between labels computed with automatic metrics
and labels from human annotations: (1) Spearman’s 𝜌 correlation
coefficient, and (2) accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score by as-
suming human annotations as truth. Because gender polarity and
sentiment have three classification labels (positive, negative, and
8https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/animations/wivivi/wivivi.html
neutral in sentiments; or male, female, and neutral in gender po-
larity), we compute the second set of metrics on a per-class basis
and use the average of per-class scores weighted by the number of
samples in each class.
Table 8 summarizes the result in which we find a strong correla-
tion between human annotations for male and female gender with
both cosine similarly based gender polarity metrics (Spearman’s
𝜌 correlation coefficient: .9126 and .9186). Among all three gender
polarity metrics, unigram matching has the lowest Spearman’s 𝜌
correlation coefficient with .8785 and lowest f1-score with 85.64. As
shown in Fig. 6a and b, with both Gender-Max and Gender-Wavg, a
larger proportion of mismatch is caused by a text that is annotator’s
neutral (blue curve) but automated metrics’ male (score ≤ −0.25).
By contrast, a larger proportion of error with unigram matching
occurs when an annotator’s male (red curve) is computed as a neu-
tral (score = 0) by the automatic metric (see Fig. 6c). One reason
for this error is that the classification to male or female class with
unigram matching is reliant on the manually chosen list of tokens
for male and female gender.
Automatic metrics for sentiment and toxicity are also positively
correlated with human annotations of sentiment and toxicity, how-
ever, with a smaller value of Spearman’s 𝜌 correlation coefficient
(sentiments: .5163 and toxicity: .5839). Table 8 shows that the accu-
racy, precision, recall and f1-score for both sentiment and toxicity
metrics are close to 80%. For sentiment metric, recall and precision
are higher for neutral labels than for positive or negative labels in-
dicating that the automatic metric can more easily identify neutral
labels. For toxicity metric, precision is similar for both toxic and
non-toxic classes (toxic = 79.34 and non-toxic = 81.25). However,
recall for the non-toxic class is much higher than the recall for
the toxic class (non-toxic = 89.02 and toxic = 67.24). This is also
demonstrated by Fig. 6d in which part of the annotator’s toxic texts
(red curve) have lower toxicity scores indicating that these texts
were misclassified as non-toxic with automatic metric. This means
that there is a higher chance that the automatic metric will miss
labeling toxic text as toxic. This could be one reason why our auto-
matic toxicity evaluation results showed only a small proportion of
overall texts as toxic. The lower correlation of automatic toxicity
and sentiment labels with human annotations could be because
toxicity and sentiment more strongly depend on the textual context
which human can more easily identify than classifiers.

All in all, we find that all automatic metrics positively correlate
with human annotated labels. Therefore, these metrics are a good
approximation of human annotations for sentiments, toxicity and
gender polarity. These experiments also highlight the areas where
the automatic metric is less aligned with human annotations and a
potential for its improvement.
7 LIMITATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
BOLD considers a limited set of demographic domains and a specific
subset of groups within each domain. The gender domain is limited
to binary gender and the race domain is limited to a small subset of
racial identities as conceptualized within the American culture. We
note that the groups considered in this study do not cover an entire
spectrum of the real-world diversity [20]. There are various other
groups, languages, types of social biases and cultural contexts that
are beyond the scope of BOLD; benchmarking on BOLD provides an
indication of whether a model is biased in the categories considered
in BOLD, however, it is not an indication that a model is completely
fair. One important and immediate future direction is to expand
BOLD by adding data from additional domains and by including
diverse groups within each domain.
We recognize that the metrics computed in this study with vari-
ous classifier are not capable to capture the degree of social biases
in terms of sentiments, toxicity, psycholinguistic norms or gender
polarity. In Section 6.3 we validate that the automatic metrics align
with human judgement of sentiment, toxicity, and gender polarity.
We recognize that human annotations collected from crowd work-
ers cannot be considered as an absolute ground truth of social biases
as they are influenced by annotator bias such as those arising from
the cultural background or demographics of the annotator [12].
Several works have shown that the distribution of demographics
of Wikipedia authors is highly skewed resulting in various types
of biases [9, 18, 35]. Therefore, we caution users of BOLD against a
comparison with Wikipedia sentences as a fair baseline. Our exper-
iments on comparing Wikipedia sentences with texts generated by
LMs also show that the Wikipedia is not free from biases and the
biases it exhibits resemble the biases exposed in the texts generated
by LMs (see Section 6.2).
8 CONCLUSION
We presented a novel dataset BOLD and a set of metrics to evaluate
fairness in open-ended language generation. Our experiments on
evaluating the biases in three different LMs and a comparison with
Wikipedia texts show that LMs are prone to more frequently gener-
ating texts with negative connotations towards a particular group
of people or an idea than others. For instance, these models more
frequently generate texts with negative sentiments and toxicity
towards the African American group and more frequently generate
text containing male words when a profession context is provided.
We also show that GPT-2, CTRL-THT, and CTRL-OPN conform
more to social biases than BERT and CTRL-WIKI. This shows a
crucial need to study and benchmark social biases in open-ended
language generation and prevent the reinforcement of detrimental
biases in downstream tasks. With these findings and the proposed
dataset, in this paper, we provide a test-bed for researchers and
practitioners to benchmark the fairness of their LMs.
