ABSTRACT
The recent adoption of machine learning models in high-risk set-
tings such as medicine has increased demand for developments in
privacy and fairness. Rebalancing skewed datasets using synthetic
data created by generative adversarial networks (GANs) has shown
potential to mitigate disparate impact on minoritized subgroups.
However, such generative models are subject to privacy attacks
that can expose sensitive data from the training dataset. Di￿erential
privacy (DP) is the current leading solution for privacy-preserving
machine learning. Di￿erentially private GANs (DP GANs) are often
considered a potential solution for improving model fairness while
maintaining privacy of sensitive training data. We investigate the
impact of using synthetic images from DP GANs on downstream
classi￿cation model utility and fairness. We demonstrate that exist-
ingDPGANs cannot simultaneouslymaintainmodel utility, privacy,
and fairness. The images generated from GAN models trained with
DP exhibit extreme decreases in image quality and utility which
leads to poor downstream classi￿cation model performance. Our
evaluation highlights the friction between privacy, fairness, and
utility and how this directly translates into real loss of performance
and representation in common machine learning settings. Our re-
sults show that additional work improving the utility and fairness
of DP generative models is required before they can be utilized as
a potential solution to privacy and fairness issues stemming from
lack of diversity in the training dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION
Machine learning models are being trained for use in high-stakes
settings on sensitive data in domains such as medicine [6, 63, 72, 79]
and consumer ￿nance [36, 41, 83]. These models can have disparate
impacts on minoritized subgroups for a number of reasons, in-
cluding due to class imbalance [20, 49] and small minority sample
sizes [9] in the underlying training dataset. These impacts often
amplify existing prejudices against minorities in society under the
guise of automated impartiality [13, 16, 46].
The use of balanced synthetic datasets created by Generative Ad-
versarial Networks (GANs) [27] to augment classi￿cation training
has demonstrated some bene￿ts for reducing disparate impact due
to minoritized subgroup imbalance [2, 19, 56]. However, GANs and
the synthetic data generated from them are vulnerable to privacy
attacks [12, 14, 67, 70, 76] due to their tendency to memorize the
training distribution. This makes GANs vulnerable to membership
inference attacks [12, 30] which can expose sensitive information
about individuals in the underlying training data to malicious enti-
ties [12, 14, 67, 70, 76].
Di￿erential privacy (DP) [21] is the leading technique for pre-
serving privacy in statistical and machine learning settings. It has
seen successful applications at Google, Apple, and in the US Cen-
sus [29] resulting in its increased popularity and use. DP guarantees
privacy by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any particular
individual does not signi￿cantly change the output distribution of
an algorithm [21]. Di￿erentially private stochastic gradient descent
(DP-SGD) is a popular method for training deep learning models
with DP [1]. While DP-SGD has strong theoretical guarantees for
privacy and generalization, its application has been shown to dis-
parately impact model performance for minoritized subgroups in
imbalanced datasets theoretically [25] and empirically in the ￿elds
of computer vision and natural language processing [5, 23].
GANs trained without DP have been extremely successful at gen-
erating high quality synthetic images [39]. Dataset augmentation
using GANs has been shown to improve downstream classi￿cation
performance [50]. Training classi￿cation models on di￿erentially
private [59, 81] synthetic data has been proposed as a technique
to ensure the privacy of training data [22, 68]. Empirically, GANs
trained with DP have been shown to generate useful synthetic

images on simpler datasets such as MNIST [81]. Most investiga-
tions of DP GANs on image datasets have used lower dimensional
datasets such as MNIST and SVHN, though some have utilized high-
dimensional facial datasets such as CelebA[48], and more challeng-
ing tabular datasets [75, 81, 82]. However, to our knowledge there
have been no investigations into whether DP synthetic images pro-
vide the same improvements to utility and fairness in downstream
classi￿cations that synthetic images generated without privacy do.
Furthermore, past DP GAN research has not taken advantage of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) GAN architectures such as Progressively
Growing GANs (PG-GANs) [39] that have been advantageous in
generating high-dimensional image data. Such composite analysis
of the fairness, utility, and privacy impacts of DP is essential for its
application in real-life systems.
In this work, we investigate the viability of DP synthetic data
as a solution to improving both utility and fairness of downstream
classi￿cation, while maintaining privacy. We focus on two chest
x-ray datasets, the MIMIC Chest X-Ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset [38]
and CheXpert (CXP) [33], and two facial datasets, CelebA-HQ [39]
and FairFace [44], one dermatology datasets, the ISIC archive [64].
To succeed in this analysis, we extend the current theory for
the sequential adaptive composition of heterogeneous Rényi di￿er-
ential privacy (RDP) sampled Gaussian mechanisms and provide
new guarantees to support training state-of-the-art DP GANs such
as Progressively Growing GANs (PG-GANS) [39]. Based on these
new guarantees we empirically investigate the e￿ect that DP syn-
thetic data generated from PG-GANs has on the utility and fairness
of classi￿cation models. We compare the generated image qual-
ity as we increase privacy levels and investigate whether there is
disparate impact to image quality across subgroups. Next, we inves-
tigate whether DP protects all subgroups equally from membership
inference attacks on GANs. Finally, we investigate the impacts of
training downstream classi￿cation models on balanced DP syn-
thetic datasets. We quantify the impacts on both model utility and
fairness. We demonstrate that DP does not introduce unfairness
into the data generation process or to standard group fairness mea-
sures in the downstream classi￿cation models, but does unfairly
increase the in￿uence of majority subgroups. DP also signi￿cantly
reduces the quality of the images generated from the GANs, which
decrease the utility of the synthetic data in downstream tasks.
Our results demonstrate that more research into new techniques
is needed to improve the utility and quality of synthetic image
data generated using DP GANs. Currently, applying DP-SGD to
GANs does not result in high quality high-dimensional private
synthetic image datasets that are useful for training downstream
classi￿cation models.
1.1 Contributions
• We provide a new upper bound on the privacy loss of the
sequential adaptive composition of heterogeneous RDP
mechanisms to support private training of PG-GANs. Cur-
rent adaptive composition bounds for sampled Gaussian RDP
mechanisms assume constant sampling probability (batch size)
across all steps taken by the learning algorithm. Thus, those
bounds do not apply to PG-GAN architectures which have vary-
ing sampling probabilities during training. Our method allows
us to reliably quantify the privacy guarantees from PG-GANs.
Our new bounds are an important addition to understanding the
sequential adaptive composition of the heterogeneous sampled
Gaussian RDP mechanism.
• DP signi￿cantly decreases image quality, but there are no
trends in the di￿erence in image quality between subgroups.
Generated image quality is reduced by DP overall but there is no
observed disparate subgroup impact in our chosen datasets.
• DPGANs defend againstmembership inference attacks in
the presence of dataset shift. We show that GANs trained
without privacy are subject to membership inference attacks
when the test set is shifted from the training set, and demonstrate
that DP defends against these attacks.
• DP synthetic images decrease downstream model perfor-
mance. We ￿nd that due to the poor quality of the DP synthetic
images, the performance of downstream classi￿cation models
signi￿cantly degrade.
• DP synthetic images have the potential to give unfair in-
￿uence to majority subgroups but result in no changes to
group fairness measures.We ￿nd that the use of DP synthetic
images results in no signi￿cant changes to classi￿cation model
group fairness measures. However, the in￿uence of the major-
ity subgroup on the downstream predictions can increase with
increased privacy for highly imbalanced datasets.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATEDWORK
2.1 Di￿erential Privacy
Di￿erential privacy (DP) [21] ensures that the output of statistical
analyses are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular
individual. It provides important theoretical guarantees for privacy
and has been shown empirically to defend against privacy attacks
[14, 35, 67].
DP-SGD is currently the leading private learning algorithm for
training neural networks [1, 35]. Other private learning algorithms
such as objective perturbation are only applicable to linear models
because they assume convex loss functions [10]. The privacy loss
in DP-SGD is tracked using methods such as the Moments Accoun-
tant [1] or the Rényi di￿erential privacy (RDP) Accountant [54]. DP
learning algorithms focus on learning the body of the joint data and
label distribution. By doing so, they omit the tails of the distribu-
tion [24]. Recent work shows that this leads to disparate impact for
minoritized subgroups due to the combination of gradient clipping
and noise addition [5, 23]. Additional background about di￿erential
privacy has been included in Appendix A.1.
2.2 GANs for Image Generation
GANs [27] learn to model a data distribution. They can then sam-
ple from the modeled distribution to generate novel data and are
extremely e￿ective at learning high-dimensional distributions such
as image data [39]. The training procedure follows a minimax op-
timization problem between a generator and a discriminator[27].
Conditional GAN models are modi￿ed to also input a label to both
the generator and the discriminator in order to learn a conditional
distribution based on that label [55].

Progressive Growing GANs. Many of the current state-of-the-
art GAN models such as PG-GAN [39] and StyleGAN [40] use pro-
gressive growing architectures. These architectures progressively
grow the generator and discriminator networks by gradually adding
additional layers. This helps the model to learn global features at
low resolutions and local features at high resolutions, and mitigates
common GAN training issues such as mode collapse [39].
Di￿erentially Private GANs. GANs tend to output data sam-
ples that are closer to the training data than to unseen data [81],
raising privacy concerns when the training data contains sensi-
tive information. Di￿erentially private GANs (DP GANs) [81] and
Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles GANs (PATE-GANs)
[58, 59, 82] are able to achieve di￿erential privacy in GANs by em-
ploying the DP-SGD or PATE mechanism during training. Since
PATE-GAN has not yet been shown to be e￿ective on image data,
we focus our investigation on DP-SGD. We have chosen to employ
the progressively growing technique with the conditional version
of DP GANs in our work (DP-CGANs)[73].
Additional background about GANs has been included in Ap-
pendix A.2.
2.3 Di￿erential Privacy and Fairness
Di￿erentially private training has been shown to degrade model
accuracy [37]. This accuracy drop is more signi￿cant in DP-SGD
for minoritized subgroups in the training dataset [5, 23]. Recent
attempts to make di￿erentially private learning fair have looked at
Lagrangian dual approaches [74] and post-processing techniques
similar to equalized odds and multicalibration [34]. Most current
work in DP dataset synthesis focuses on low-dimensional image
or tabular data and does not investigate the e￿ects on downstream
classi￿cation fairness [3, 22, 75].
2.4 Improving Model Performance With
Synthetic Data
Augmenting the original training dataset using generated images
from GANs [19, 65, 80] has shown promise in improving perfor-
mance in downstream tasks.
Downstream Training with DP. DP is immune to post-
processing [21]. This means the output of a di￿erentially private
mechanism cannot be made less private regardless of any auxiliary
information or the unbounded computational resources a malicious
entity may have. This is important for using DP synthetic images
because downstream models trained on these generated images
do not need to use DP in their training process. Therefore, we can
train classi￿cation models on generated di￿erentially private data
and maintain privacy.
3 EXTENDING THE RDP ACCOUNTANT TO
PROGRESSIVELY GROWING TRAINING
We use the TensorFlow Privacy library [52] to train our models with
DP-SGD and to track the privacy loss using an RDP [54] accountant
for sampled Gaussian mechanisms (SGM). This implementation
is based on the theoretical analyses in [54] which assumes that
batch size remains constant throughout training. PG-GANs de-
crease batch size during training due to memory constraints [39].
Existing work on DP PG-GANs naively applies the RDP Accountant
and provides underestimates of the privacy loss [12]. We extend
the RDP for SGM privacy analysis to account for varying batch
sizes throughout training in Section 3.1. We use this modi￿cation
to measure the privacy of our model using the derived n guarantee.
Lower n values mean higher privacy.
Note that the privacy guarantees we provide are underestimates
of the true privacy loss because we do not add the privacy loss
incurred due to hyper-parameter search [11, 47].
3.1 Extending the RDP Accountant
We derive a new tight upper bound on the privacy loss for our PG-
GAN training and provide a loose upper bound which generalizes
more broadly to progressively growing learning procedures. We use
this modi￿cation to the RDP for SGM accountant to track privacy
loss.
Progressively Growing Private Training Analysis. We pre-
sent a theoretical analysis on the upper bound of the RDP of our
models trained with progressively growing training. We extend the
theoretical work of [54] for our speci￿c use case.

Analysis. DP-SGD can be viewed as an adaptive sequential
composition of ) (U, n)-RDP mechanisms. Previous analyses such
as the Moments Accountant [1] and RDP Accountant [54] assume
that the sampling probability for each mechanism is constant. In
our work we examine the composition when the sampling prob-
ability decreases during training due to the progressive growing
learning algorithm, thus motivating the extension of existing com-
position upper bounds for decreasing sampling probability over
the ) sequential adaptive mechanisms. We extend the composition
theorems for RDP [53] and tight bounds for RDP sampled Gaussian
mechanisms [54] to this unique case of sequential adaptive com-
position with decreasing sampling probability that appears when
training PG-GANs. We prove both theorems in Appendix E.
T￿￿￿￿￿￿ 3.6. Decreasing Sampling Probability With Con-
stant Decay and Steps. Let there be T RDP sampled Gaussian mech-
anisms (SGMs). We partition this set of mechanisms k times. Each
partition is made up of T/k (U, n8 )-RDP mechanisms where 8 = [:].
For each partition the original sampling probability @1 decays by

We provide a tight upper bound on" given these assumptions
and the assumptions on @ and f from the previous theorem.
In our previous theorem, we provide a tight upper bound based
on the assumptions regarding the varying sampling probabilities
and the number of steps taken at each sampling probability. Typ-
ically, the sampling probability decreases over time because we
reduce the batch size. Since we reduce the batch size the number
of steps taken increases compared to previous batch sizes. For our
theoretical analysis, we make the prior theorem more generalizable
by only assuming that the number of steps for each sampling prob-
ability is greater than that of the previous sampling probability (i.e.
that the number of step (8+1 > (8 8 8 = 1, 2, · · · ,:).

4 METHODS
Figure 1 shows our model training and evaluation pipeline.
We ￿rst trained GANs on real image data with and without
progressive growing to compare which architecture produces the
best images when training with di￿erential privacy. We focus our
evaluations on PG-GANs, as they produce higher quality images
than non-growing GANs (Section 7).
4.1 GAN Architecture
Our GAN model is a conditional variation of the PG-GAN [39]
trained with a di￿erentially private discriminator model [73]. This
training process allows for the generator model to be di￿erentially
private as well, via the Post-Processing Theorem as shown in Ap-
pendix A.3. The GAN is trained with an Adam optimizer [42] with
gradient clipping and noise addition based on DP-SGD [1]. We
condition our PG-GAN using both the protected and target labels
to ensure that we can generate a balanced synthetic dataset to train
our downstream classi￿cation models. All images used in the GAN
training process and the rest of our evaluation pipeline have been
resized to be 64⇥64 pixels.

4.2 Progressively Growing Training
Progressively growing training [39] modi￿es the standard GAN
training procedure by gradually fading layers into the model rather
than training all the layers at the same time. This process trains
the model at lower resolution images ￿rst, allowing it to learn the
high-level structure of the data before learning the low-level details.
In order to accommodate for memory constraints, the mini-batch
size is decreased as the model size and image resolution increases.
This procedure has been shown to improve the resulting generated
image quality [39].
4.3 Di￿erentially Private Training
We train models without privacy guarantees using stochastic gra-
dient descent (SGD). Models are trained with DP-SGD [1], which is
the only currently suitable di￿erentially private learning method
for deep neural networks. DP-SGD makes two modi￿cations to
SGD: clipping gradients computed on a per-example basis to have a
maximum ✓2 norm, and then adding Gaussian noise to these gradi-
ents before applying parameter updates [1]. We select the clipping
norm to be 1.0 from hyper-parameter tuning. We use three di￿erent
noise multipliers of [0.0001, 0.0010, 0.1000] corresponding to low,
medium, and high privacy settings respectively. For each task, four
increasing levels of privacy are explored: No Privacy (Standard
PG-GAN Model), Low Privacy, Medium Privacy, and High Privacy.
We use our modi￿cation to the RDP accountant discussed in
Section 3.1 to track the privacy loss of the model. The epsilon
values for each privacy level and dataset are presented in Appendix
F.
4.4 Downstream Model Training
Wegenerate balanced synthetic datasets using the trained PG-GANs
for each real dataset at each privacy level. Each synthetic data is the
same size as the corresponding real dataset, but is balanced across
both the protected attribute and the target prediction attribute. The
attributes for each dataset are listed in Table 1.
We then use these balanced synthetic datasets to train 3 di￿erent
types of downstream classi￿cation models [61] to predict the target
label: linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), and multi-layer
perceptron (MLP).
5 EVALUATION
5.1 Evaluation of Synthetic Image Quality
We evaluate the quality of synthesized images from these GANs us-
ing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [32]. FID estimates the quality
and diversity of a set of synthetic images as compared to the real
dataset. It extracts the activations of the real and generated images
from the last pooling layer of Inception v3 [71]. These activations
are used to measure the distance between the distribution of the
real images and the distributions of the generated images.
5.2 Evaluating Privacy Attacks for GANs
We perform membership inference attacks on the GANs across all
privacy levels to measure the ability of DP to defend against these
attacks. Membership inference [14, 67] exploits the memorization
of training examples in the parameters of neural networks [24]. We
assume that the malicious entity has access to the trained generator
leading to a white-box attack [12]. This is a reasonable assumption
given that trained GAN models are often released publicly.
We use a white box membership inference attack [12] based
on the reconstruction loss for each image. The attacker uses the
parameters of the generator model to optimize the random latent
vector inputted to the model to reproduce the given images as
closely as possible. The reconstruction loss between this reproduced
generated image and the real image is lower for images that can be
reproducedmore closely. The imageswith the lowest reconstruction
loss are taken by the attacker to be members of the original training
set. If this attack has a high success rate measured by the Area
Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) [8], then we
conclude that the model has high memorization and is vulnerable
to membership inference privacy attacks.
5.3 Downstream Model Evaluation
Classi￿cation Performance. We measure the performance of
models using AUC on real test images from the original real dataset.
Group Fairness Metrics. We evaluate classi￿cation fairness
under four di￿erent standard measures of group fairness [28]: per-
formance gap, parity gap, recall gap, and speci￿city gap. We provide
de￿nitions for these metrics in Appendix B.
Group In￿uence Metrics. We also measure fairness via the
level of in￿uence as de￿ned by Cook’s distance [15] for each sub-
group. Cook’s Distance captures the in￿uence of a particular train-
ing point on a linear regression model.
6 DATA
We conduct our experiments on two chest x-ray datasets, theMIMIC
Chest X-Ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset [38] and CheXpert (CXP) [33],
two facial datasets, CelebA-HQ [39] and FairFace [44], and one
dermatology dataset, the ISIC archive [64]. Table 1 reports the label
distributions for these datasets. Detailed dataset distributions are
reported in Appendix D. We intentionally selected a variety of
balanced and imbalanced datasets in order to investigate the e￿ect
of imbalanced training data.
All 6 datasets use the same methods and evaluation pipeline as
described in Sections 4 and 5.
6.1 Chest X-Ray Datasets
We take M￿￿￿/F￿￿￿￿￿ to be our protected attribute based on prior
work demonstrating disparities in chest x-ray classi￿er performance
for this label [45, 66]. We pick the E￿￿￿￿￿￿￿ label to be our target
label out of a possible 14 labels because it is one of the most preva-
lent labels in MIMIC-CXR (23.72% positive rate) and CXP (40.14%
positive rate). We only use the frontal images in both datasets. Our
experiments on this data investigate if our methods are able to
improve the fairness of models in the medical imaging ￿eld.
6.2 Dermatology Dataset

6.3 Facial Datasets
We take S￿￿￿ T￿￿￿ as our protected attribute in our facial datasets.
We generate the binary skin tone label based on Fitzpatrick Skin
Tone categories using the same process as for the dermatology
dataset. FairFace [44] only contains labels for the attributes of race,
gender, and age. We formulate a label Y￿￿￿￿ to be the target pre-
dictor label in FairFace by splitting the provided age buckets in
half. We select Y￿￿￿￿/O￿￿ as the target label in CelebA-HQ [39]
to match our FairFace labels.
FacialDatasets, Recognition, and Fairness. There have been
several facial datasets that have recently been constructed by the
computer vision community, such as CelebA-HQ [39] and Fair-
Face [44]. The collection and use of these datasets has led to con-
cerning and unethical research due to the inherent systemic bi-
ases (sexism, racism, colorism, and ageism) from the collection of
the images and their labels [9, 18]. We use CelebA-HQ [39] and
FairFace [44] in our experiments for prediction tasks to illustrate
our hypotheses about privacy and fairness. Our analysis serves
to demonstrate the negative e￿ects of using these labels. We do
not condone use of and prediction on these datasets in practical
scenarios. We emphasize that irresponsible and unethical usage
of these labels and datasets could have harmful impacts on the
research community, and on society-at-large.
7 EXPERIMENT: EVALUATING QUALITY OF
SYNTHETIC DP DATA
First, we analyze the e￿ect of increasing levels of privacy on the
quality of images generated by the DP PG-GANs conditioned on
our protected attributes and target labels.
Experimental Setup. We evaluate the quality of generated im-
ages compared to real images across GANs of increasing privacy
levels using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [32]. We also measure
this on a subgroup level to quantify possible disparate impact.
Image Quality Metrics. A low FID score indicates that the set
of generated images is close in distribution to the images in the
training set, and therefore realistic. The minimum possible FID
Figure 2: FID Scores of PG-GANs vs GANs. Closer to 0.0 is better.
The PG-GANs achievemuch better FID scores than the non-PGmod-
els in the DP case and similar FID Scores in the non-DP case. Models
trained with DP have poorer FID scores than models trained with-
out DP.
score is 0.0, which corresponds to the score for when the generated
image distribution exactly matches the training image distribution.
7.1 Result: Progressive Growing Training
Improves DP Synthetic Image Quality
We ￿rst con￿rmed that progressively growing training with DP
improved the resulting image quality. Figure 2 shows the di￿erences
in image quality between DP vs non-DP models trained on CelebA-
HQ. The models trained with DP are trained in the medium privacy
setting.
The models trained with DP show signi￿cant improvements
when using PG training even when non-DP models show negligible
improvements. This shows that the improvements in FID experi-
enced by large high-quality imagemodels such as StyleGAN [40] are
extensible to models trained with DP as well. It also demonstrates
the need for our formulated privacy accountant that accurately
supports progressively growing learning in Section 3. Therefore,
we focus on PG-GANs in the remainder of our experiments and
results.
7.2 Result: DP Degrades Quality of Synthetic
Images
High privacy levels result in lower image quality across all datasets.
Figure 3b shows the computed FID metric for each privacy level and

domain ("Cross-Dataset") as listed in Table 1. Attacks using test images from a di￿erent dataset of the same domain are more
successful (lower AUC is better). The cross-dataset white box attacks are less successful for DP-trained GANs. Therefore, DP
protects against membership inference attacks. Di￿erence in attack AUC between protected subclasses increases as privacy
increases for CelebA-HQ. From the reconstructed images, we can see that the model trained without privacy is able to more
closely reconstruct the input images than the models trained with privacy, indicating potential memorizing and over-￿tting
to the training set. Additional attack results are included in Appendix H.

vacy levels increases. Figure 3a qualitatively visualizes the output
of the GAN models trained on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. The images
become noisier and more unrecognizable as privacy increases. Syn-
thetic chest X-ray images were also reviewed post-submission by a
licensed radiologist to con￿rm that the quality of the x-ray images
decreased as privacy levels increased.
Finally, we ￿nd no trends in the FID di￿erence across the pro-
tected subgroups with increasing privacy levels (Figure 3b).
8 EXPERIMENT: EVALUATING ROBUSTNESS
TO PRIVACY ATTACKS
We measure the e￿cacy of di￿erent levels of DP for protecting
PG-GANs against white-box membership inference attacks [12]
compared to PG-GANs trained without DP.
Experimental Setup. We use the vulnerability to white-box
attacks of PG-GANs trained without DP as our baseline for this
evaluation. We then measure the attack success on PG-GANs with
155
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Cheng, et al.
increasing levels of privacy across all datasets. The attack is success-
ful if it is able to accurately predict which data points are from the
original training set of the model. We evaluate whether increased
privacy reduces attack success.
We evaluate both the setting where the training and test set of
images are from the same distribution (within the same dataset),
and the setting where the training set and test are from di￿erent
datasets in the same domain (i.e. across CelebA-HQ and FairFace).
White-Box Membership Inference Attack [12]. In a white-
box attack, the adversary attempts to infer whether a particular
image belonged to the original training set of a generative model
based on the model’s ability to reconstruct that image. The model
parameters are used to optimize a latent variable input to the model
in order to minimize reconstruction loss and produce a synthetic
image that most closely resembles the given image.
Performing this attack on both training and test images allows
us to estimate training set membership since models with memo-
rization will be able to better reconstruct the training images than
unseen images. We use 1000 training images and 1000 unseen test
images (2000 images total). The model takes the 1000 images with
the lowest reconstruction loss to be members of the training set.
The AUC of the white-box attacks represents the success level
of the attack at predicting training set membership. Higher AUC
means that the attacker can more accurately infer if an individual’s
data was used to train the GAN.
8.1 Result: DP Protects GANs From
Membership Inference
Prior work demonstrates that membership inference is unsuccessful
in GANs that are trained on large enough datasets [12]. In Figure
4a, we observe this to be true across all privacy levels when the
training and test sets are from the same distribution. When the
training and test set are from di￿erent datasets within the same do-
main, GANs trained without privacy are vulnerable to membership
inference. In this setting of dataset shift, DP protects GANs from
membership inference. We qualitatively analyze the e￿ectiveness of
this white-box attack in Figure 4c. Models trained without privacy
can reproduce the training set images almost exactly.
In real-life applications, dataset shift is a common occurrence
[62], so this result presents dangerous privacy implications for
deploying generative models trained without DP in real settings.
Therefore, di￿erential privacy is essential for preventing these at-
tacks, especially when a model is publicly released.
We observe that increasing privacy results in less protection
for the minoritized subgroup in the presence of dataset shift for
CelebA-HQ, the most imbalanced dataset use in our evaluations
(Figure 4b). There is no trend observed amongst the other datasets
used in our evaluation.
9 EXPERIMENT: FAIRNESS OF MODELS
TRAINED ON PRIVATE SYNTHETIC DATA
We measure the e￿ect of DP synthetic data on downstream classi￿-
cation model fairness in order to evaluate the relationship between
privacy and utility. We perform the evaluation across all datasets
and privacy levels.
Experimental Setup. Three di￿erent downstream algorithms
are evaluated: linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), and multi-
layer perceptron (MLP). The DP PG-GANs from our previous ex-
periments are used to create balanced synthetic datasets at each
privacy level for downstream training. The downstream algorithms
are evaluated on the real test images from each corresponding
dataset, predicting the target label as listed in Table 1.
Our baseline is the classi￿cation performance when trained on
the entire unbalanced corpus of real training data. For training on
the synthesized data, a dataset of the same size as the real data
was generated, balanced across both the protected attribute and
the target attribute.
Utility and Fairness Metrics. We evaluate model utility using
AUC. We evaluate model fairness according to standard group fair-
ness measures between the protected attribute classes: performance
gap (AUC di￿erence between subclasses), parity gap, speci￿city
gap, and recall gap.
9.1 Result: DP Reduces Classi￿cation Model
Utility
The AUC of the classi￿cation models decreases as the privacy level
increases across all datasets (Figure 5). Therefore, the reduced image
quality due to DP results in poor data utility and poor downstream
model performance.
9.2 Result: DP Has No Impact on Standard
Group Fairness Metrics
We observe no trends in any group fairness metrics for the down-
stream classi￿cation models (Figure 5) as privacy increases. Results
for additional group fairness metrics like parity gap, speci￿city gap,
and recall gap have been included in Appendix I.
10 EXPERIMENT: SUBGROUP INFLUENCE
ON DOWNSTREAM CLASSIFICATION
MODELS
Experimental Setup. In addition to standard group fairness
metrics on downstream models, we also measure fairness in terms
of the in￿uence of each synthetic training data point. For each
generated dataset, we use Cook’s distance [15] to evaluate the
in￿uence of each training point on a downstream linear regression
model.
In￿uence Metrics. Cook’s Distance [15] quanti￿es the e￿ect
that the training point has on the downstream model’s predictions
based on the change in themodels prediction values when that point
is excluded from the training set. We provide a detailed de￿nition
for this metric in Appendix B.
A highly in￿uential point is considered to be any point that has
a Cook’s Distance value of over 4/=, where = is the total number
of training data points [7]. We measure in￿uence fairness as the
percentage of highly in￿uential points from themajority class. To be
determined as fair, when trained on the balanced synthetic datasets,
the set of highly in￿uential points should contain equal proportions
of the protected subclasses.

no trend on the group fairness metrics. Additional downstream evaluations and fairness metrics are included in Appendix I.
Figure 6: Percentage of In￿uential Points (as de￿ned byCook’s Dis-
tance) from the majority class at di￿erent privacy levels. Closer to
50% is more fair. DP synthetic data increases the in￿uence of the
majority class as noise increases for highly imbalanced datasets. In-
￿uence in the high privacy setting has been excluded due to the
low utility of the model, rendering any in￿uence on the prediction
output essentially meaningless. Additional in￿uence results are in-
cluded in Appendix J.
10.1 Result: DP Can Disparately Impacts
In￿uence on Highly Imbalanced Datasets
As shown in Figure 6, we observe that synthetic data created by
GAN models trained without DP improves or approximately main-
tains in￿uence fairness when compared to the real training set for
all datasets.
As the privacy level increases, more in￿uence tends to be given to
points from the majority subgroup in imbalanced datasets. CelebA-
HQ (the most imbalanced dataset used in our evaluation) displays
a signi￿cant increase in in￿uence unfairness in the presence of any
DP. Models trained on synthetic data created from more balanced
datasets used in our evaluations do not experience the same level
of disparate impact or do not display any consistent trends. There-
fore, even when the synthetically generated dataset is balanced,
imbalances in the protected attribute in the original training set
can still potentially result in unfair and harmful over-in￿uence of
majority subgroups in downstream evaluations.
11 DISCUSSION
11.1 The Need For Diverse Real Data
Lack of diversity in training datasets is known to amplify societal
biases for minoritized subgroups. For example, such de￿ciencies
in facial recognition algorithms have led to signi￿cantly worse
recognition rates for black female faces in commercially deployed
algorithms [9]. Similarly, the lack of variation in medical chest x-ray
datasets can cause models to have consistently poor performance
on important subsets of the data [57]. Our analysis emphasizes that
biased datasets may still have disparate impacts on downstream
classi￿cation in￿uence, even when the real dataset is not directly
used in the downstream training process and even when the syn-
thetic dataset used for the training is balanced. Therefore, supple-
menting or replacing datasets with synthetic data does not mitigate
the fairness concerns caused by the existing biases in imbalanced
datasets.
11.2 Privacy Risks of Synthetic Data
Synthetic data augmentation is often explored as a solution to
missing data or to data privacy issues, such as in credit card fraud
detection models [4] and sports medicine research [77]. Although
synthetic data can be realistic and appear promising to use as a
replacement for real data, the privacy risk associated with doing
so remains high. While commonly used for creating synthetic data,
generative models do not guarantee privacy by design [12, 14, 67, 70,
157
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Cheng, et al.
76].We have shown that GANs trainedwithout DP are vulnerable to
membership inference privacy attacks, especially in the presence of
dataset shift. Releasing a GANmodel therefore exposes the training
set to attackers, and can result in the leakage of sensitive data.
11.3 The Price of Privacy
Our investigation into the e￿ect of DP on state-of-the-art PG-GAN
models in terms of downstream model utility, privacy, and fairness
shows the negative reality of the trade-o￿s. We have demonstrated
that training with DP can address privacy concerns, but has the
potential to skew the in￿uence towards the majority subgroups,
exacerbating already existing inequities in the data collection pro-
cesses.
As well, while DP has strong theoretical guarantees, it can sig-
ni￿cantly degrade model utility when applied in real-word set-
tings [37, 60]. The loss in utility of the synthetic data as privacy
increases causes much higher rates of misclassi￿cations in down-
stream models. This decrease in model performance can lead to dis-
astrous e￿ects in important settings such as weapons identi￿cation
[51] and pedestrian identi￿cation for autonomous cars [31, 69, 78].
11.4 Limitations Of Our Analysis
We caution that the automatic detection of facial labels is only per-
formed as an example and should not be considered a valid task
for deployed applications. Many labels that are associated with fa-
cial datasets such as Y￿￿￿￿, S￿￿￿￿￿￿, or A￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿ (all available
labels in the CelebA-HQ dataset) are disproportionately biased to-
wards women and other minoritized groups. When these predictors
are applied in settings such as automatic hiring algorithms [17],
they can be used against these minoritized groups in the screening
process.
The analysis we present also contains limitations in the auto-
mated skin tone categorization, since Fitzpatrick categories are
known to be subject to lighting conditions and are inherently sub-
jective, even to human dermatologists [43]. Cameras are also known
to less accurately capture darker skin tones [26]. We also reiter-
ate the inherent ￿aws in our labels for our downstream models,
speci￿cally predicting age attributes. Labels with less problematic
implications should be used in the future provided they are avail-
able.
12 CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK
Our analysis shows that balanced di￿erentially private synthetic
datasets are e￿ective against privacy attacks. However, DP GANs
display a decrease in dataset image quality and downstream clas-
si￿cation accuracy. The utility of the synthetic images decreases
signi￿cantly with increased privacy for standard downstream tasks,
resulting in close to random classi￿cation predictions. We conclude
that more work needs to be done on di￿erentially private data syn-
thesis before it is ready to be applied in real-world settings such as
high-dimensional medical images or facial images.
Additional future work can also be done around the training
of progressively growing models with di￿erential privacy. When
training at low resolutions with DP-SGD, the noise added during
the training process prevents the model from e￿ectively learning
essential low level structures of the images, resulting in much worse
quality images than if the noise is only added when the model is
learning the high-level details. Theoretical work must be done
around how this technique would a￿ect privacy guarantees.
