ABSTRACT
Perhaps the most controversial questions in the study of online
platforms today surround the extent to which platforms can inter-
vene to reduce the societal ills perpetrated on them. Up for debate
is whether there exist any effective and lasting interventions a plat-
form can adopt to address, e.g., online bullying, or if other, more
far-reaching change is necessary to address such problems. Em-
pirical work is critical to addressing such questions. But it is also
challenging, because it is time-consuming, expensive, and some-
times limited to the questions companies are willing to ask. To help
focus and inform this empirical work, we here propose an agent-
based modeling (ABM) approach. As an application, we analyze
the impact of a set of interventions on a simulated online dating
platform on the lack of long-term interracial relationships in an arti-
ficial society. In the real world, a lack of interracial relationships are
a critical vehicle through which inequality is maintained. Our work
shows that many previously hypothesized interventions online
dating platforms could take to increase the number of interracial
relationships from their website have limited effects, and that the
effectiveness of any intervention is subject to assumptions about
sociocultural structure. Further, interventions that are effective in
increasing diversity in long-term relationships are at odds with plat-
forms’ profit-oriented goals. At a general level, the present work
shows the value of using an ABM approach to help understand the
potential effects and side effects of different interventions that a
platform could take.

1 INTRODUCTION
Online platforms have been criticized for their role in a profusion of
societal ills, from the increased spread of political misinformation
[4], to extrajudicial killings in the Philippines [50]. Platforms have
sought to address these issues with various interventions, from
attempts to filter or restrict various forms of content (e.g. hate
speech) [31] to attempts to decrease discriminatory practices by
users [16]. Few, if any, would argue that these interventions have
fully addressed the problems at hand. Underlying agreement to this
high-level assertion, however, lies a more debated question–what
are the limits of a platform’s ability to intervene on society’s ills?
Given the documented problems platforms have helped give rise
to, it would be wrong to assume that they have no role to play in
positive change. At the same time, however, we must be careful
to ascribe too heavy of a causal arrow to platforms. Doing so is
destined to lead to an ill-informed aura of technological determin-
ism [44], where we search for solutions to societal problems by
endlessly tweaking the structure of our technology, ignoring other
root underlying causes [20].
How might we understand the limits to a platform’s ability to
intervene to reduce a given societal ill? Empirical work, especially
based on natural experiments [42] and using algorithmic auditing
[28, 54], is critical, but is restricted to studying the platform as it
currently exists. Exploration of the effects of interventions is thus
limited to what platforms are willing and able to implement given
their profit-oriented goals. Even beyond these profit-related restric-
tions, there are ethical questions about the use of experimentation
without the consent of platform users [59].
Even still, scholars have pursued ethical empirical research not
bound by profit-oriented goals, for example, by constructing plat-
forms of their own [13, 45]. But doing so is time-consuming and
expensive; it would be useful if we could first scope potential solu-
tions and their potential side effects in a more rapid and expansive
way. Social theory can partially fulfill this role [51], but it can be
difficult to theoretically characterize, and much less operationalize,
the myriad causal factors underlying sociotechnical systems.
What is needed is amethodology that exists in thismiddle ground
between difficult empirical work on the one hand, and often abstract
theory on the other. Simulation has long filled this role of bridging
theory and empirical work in the social sciences [18, 25, 55], and
more recently has proved useful in the study of algorithmic fairness.
For example, [41], and later [17], use simulation to show concretely
how the abstract notion of feedback loops in predictive policing can
lead to settings where police unfairly target one population over
another, despite equal crime rates. Simulation has the added benefit
of being applied to hypothetical people, allowing us to carefully
and fully consider the harms that may be caused by a particular
412

intervention before it has any real effects.In the present work, we
use simulation, and specifically, an agent-based model (ABM), to
make concrete a set of proposed interventions to address a given
societal ill on a given online platform, and to provide new ideas
about their implications and side-effects.
Online Dating. Specifically, we construct an ABM of an online
dating platform and assess how interventions theorized recently by
Hutson et al. in their award-winning CSCW paper [34] affect the
degree of racial homogamy in a simulated society. Racial homogamy
is defined as the tendency of individuals to seek out and engage in
long-term relationships with individuals who are the same race.
Critically, we do not argue that racial homogamy is in and of
itself a societal ill; there are many valid reasons why individuals,
particularly those identifying with an oppressed racial group, may
want to maintain racial homogamy in their relationships. However,
racial homogamy has been well-established to contribute to the re-
inforcement of racial inequality by increasing racial segregation [3]
and racialized income inequality [26]. Hutson et al. [34] argue that
racial homogamy is hence worthy of dating-platform intervention,
as it is one racializer of economic and social inequality [34].
After detailing this connection between racial homogamy and
racial inequality, Hutson et al. [34] explore an array mechanisms
within online dating platforms that present opportunities for in-
terventions to reduce racial homogamy. For example, “search, sort,
and filter tools” allow users to perform initial searches for roman-
tic partners, and thus might encourage users to make particular
decisions about the race of their partner. Hutson et al. therefore
take, at least implicitly, the stance that platforms could construct
interventions that reduce racial homogamy. Others, however, dis-
pute this claim. In particular, Anderson et al. [2] study racial bias
in online dating from a sociological perspective, and conclude that
“merely altering the structural environment [on the platform]—say,
by creating more opportunities for individuals of different races
to interact—would not necessarily ameliorate persistent patterns
of racial homogamy in romantic relationships” (pp. 38-39). This
claim puts the ideas presented in Anderson et al.’s work in contrast
with those presented by Hutson et al., who explicitly argue that
structural changes to platforms can reduce racial homogamy.
These two papers therefore present a difference of opinion on
the extent to which interventions on online dating platforms can
impact racial homogamy, and ultimately racial inequality. However,
empirical analyses of this debate is difficult for the reasons listed
above. We therefore employ a simulation model to bridge the mid-
dle ground between Hutson et al. [34] theorized interventions and
potential future empirical work. Our work helps to operationalize
the theoretical constructs and to explore their impacts and poten-
tially unintended consequences in an artificial, but empirically and
theoretically grounded, complex sociotechnical system.
Contributions. The present work makes three contributions:
• We provide a blueprint (including an open-source modeling
framework)1 for the use of agent-based modeling to help
operationalize theory and explore the potential impacts of
interventions of online platforms
1Repository link: https://github.com/StefaniaI/ABM-for-Online-Dating.git.
• Specific to racial homogamy and online dating platforms, we
find that various interventions theorized byHutson et al. [34]
indeed decrease racial homogamy in our simulated society
according to our selected measure by as much as 10%
• However, the benefits of these interventions are dependent
on specific assumptions about the sociocultural structure of
that society, and are often at odds with societal outcomes
and profit-oriented goals of the platform
Likemany social science endeavors [64], our core findings present
claims that, once stated, seem quite obvious. However, given their
motivation from established differences of opinion in published
literature by leading scholars, our work serves a critical role in the
path forward to understanding the potential of platforms to inter-
vene to reduce racial homogamy, and as a broader methodology to
address similar questions in other domains.
2 RELATEDWORK
2.1 Online Dating
Online dating plays an increasingly central role in the process of
finding romantic partners, with 15% of Americans reporting to have
used an online dating site [11]. Indeed, at least for heterosexual
couples, online dating has become the predominant means of meet-
ing romantic partners [53]. This change in the means for dating
has opened the door to a debate on whether platforms can disrupt
patterns of assortative mating, and in particular decrease racial
homogamy. While Hutson et al. [34] argue that platforms have
the means of decreasing racial homogamy through interventions,
Anderson et al. [2] think that this would likely not be the case as
homogamy is partly caused by same-race preferences which cannot
be changed through opportunity alone. These preferences influence
and are influenced by social norms, and their formation is based on
imitation and recurrent behaviour [48] and enforced through social
verification [29]. To capture this phenomena, we consider norms
and their impact on preferences. In alignment with Hutson et al.
[34], we acknowledge that platforms can potentially intervene to
change norms on the platform, so, in our model, we differentiate
between offline and online norms.
The process people go through while dating online is complex
in multiple ways. First, one goes through a variety of different
“phases” of dating, from seeking information about dating platforms
to developing a long-term relationship [19]. Second, the decision-
making process depends on distinct factors such as the perceived
level of compatibility [9], how much we can validly infer about
others online [22], and one’s own personal stereotypes [37].
The complexity of studying dating have naturally given rise
to the use of simulations. Previous agent-based models for dating
have looked at, for example, how the selection of partners is influ-
enced by space and mobility [60], and whether assortative mating
patterns could explain previously observed statistics on marriages
and divorce [32]. We build upon these examples in our work, but
focus on the novel problem of understanding the role of platform
interventions on racial homogamy in the context of online dating.
2.2 Uses of Simulation to Study Fairness
Starting with the seminal work of Schelling [55] on housing seg-
regation, simulation has been widely leveraged to explore how
413
An Agent-based Model to Evaluate Interventions on Online Dating Platforms to Decrease Racial Homogamy FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
inequality and unfairness can arise and be combated in social sys-
tems. These studies have provided useful fodder for the more recent
application of simulation to questions of algorithmic fairness. For
example, Martin Jr. et al. [43] use a type of simulation called System
Dynamics Modeling [36] to show how simulation can help us to
think through the complex impacts of different interventions in the
context of credit lending. Others have leveraged different kinds of
simulation models to study lending in similar ways, for example,
within a reinforcement learning paradigm [14]. Still others have
used simulation beyond the context of lending. For example, various
forms of simulation have been used to study fairness and feedback
loops in the context of predictive policing (as noted above [17, 41])
the effects of recommender systems [6], and income inequality for
drivers on rideshare platforms [5].
Like Bokányi and Hannák [5], we use an agent-based model here.
Agent-based modeling involves the construction of virtual worlds
in which artificial agents interact according to a set of pre-specified
rules [18]. While behavior is thus predictable at the individual level,
ABMs are useful for understanding how these pre-specified micro-
level behaviors result in emergent properties, e.g., social biases
across social groups [35] or opinion polarization [56].
Our work compliments existing literature using simulation mod-
eling to study questions of fairness and equality in three ways.
First, we study a concrete, contemporary, and contested question
about the role that online dating platforms can play in reducing
racial homogamy. Second, rather than focus on algorithmic fairness
specifically, we emphasize other ways in which online platforms
can have impacts on society. Finally, and at the same time, we de-
velop an agent-based model that can be easily extended to study
algorithmic fairness, complementing existing SystemDynamics and
reinforcement learning platforms provided by prior work [14, 43].
3 MODEL
Our model contains a variety of parameters, listed in Table 1 along-
side references, where applicable, to were used to determine their
values. Below, we first provide an overview of the model, and then
further details on each major element of the model.
3.1 Model Overview
Agents in our model are people that have at some point used our
simulated dating website. Agents are assumed to carry out a series
of activities on the site in pursuit of a romantic partner. These
activities include creating a profile (Figure 1a), searching for a
partner (b), browsing the list of potential partners returned by
that search (c), and messaging (d). Agents in our model perceive
other agents according to their attributes. As in most ABMs [24],
attributes are just a vector of 0s and 1s, but are assumed to represent
real-world traits that might be important in the context of dating,
e.g. partisanship. All agents also have a “protected attribute,” that
is, an attribute relevant to questions about discriminatory dating
practices. We will focus on race as the protected attribute here.
Moreover, we will focus on a binarized model of race, that is, agents
can be only one of two races in the model. In the context of prior
work we discuss above, the two races of interest here are White and
Black. Section 3.2 provides full details on how agents are modeled.
(a) Creating a profile (b) Searching (using filters)
(c) Browsing the (filtered) list
of potential partners
(d) Looking at (and potentially
responding to) messages
Figure 1: The actions agents can take on the platform
As shown in Figure 2, relationships between agents evolve over
a series of phases, from finding (or being found by) a potential
partner, to interacting with each other on the platform via messages
(online relationship), and finally to an offline relationship [19]. At
any phase, a relationship might end, at which point the agents
will resume their search for another romantic partner, or exit the
platform. If a relationship continues for long enough, it becomes a
long-term relationship. Our primary outcome measures focus on
racial homogamy in these long-term relationships. and Section 3.3
provides complete details on the different relationships phases.
The simulation is carried out via a sequence of iterations, or turns,
with one turn being loosely the equivalent of one day. On the first
turn of the simulation, 300 agents are initialized and become the
population of users on the online dating site. On each subsequent
turn, we add four new agents, modeling a constant flow of new
users. After new agents are added, all agents get a turn to act.
During their turn, agents can 1) conduct a search, potentially using
a set of search filters provided by the site, 2) send a message, 3) start
a new relationship, 4) continue or end an existing relationship, or
5) leave the platform, either because they have found a long-term
partner, or because they have become frustrated with the site.
As shown in Figure 2 , which of these things agents decide to do
is based on which part on the relationship phase they are in, and
on the decision model we construct for agents. The decisions made
by an agent are determined by 1) their attributes, 2) the attributes
of their potential (or current) partner, 3) the stereotypes they hold
of how different attributes are related, and 4) their preferences for
others with certain attributes. These preferences are themselves
informed by social norms that exist both on and off the platform.
Section 3.4 provides details on how agents make decisions.

Agent’s attributes are static in our model. However, their stereo-
types and preferences evolve as they interact with others and move
through relationship phases. The social norms governing all agents
also evolve throughout the simulation. Section 3.5 details when and
how these updates to stereotypes, preferences, and norms occur.
3.2 Agents
As in all ABMs, our agents have state and can take actions. Agents’
states encompass their type, attributes, stereotypes, preferences, and
knowledge of others. The actions agents take, based on these states,
are a set of decisions, which we describe in Section 3.4.
3.2.1 Type. Agents can be of two types, and are only attracted to
agents of the opposite type. We thus loosely mimic a hetero- and
mono-normative online dating website, as was studied by Anderson
et al. [2]. We return to this limitation in our conclusion. Agents are
assigned to the two modeled types with equal probability.
3.2.2 Attributes. Each agent 𝑖 has a vector of binary attributes, 𝑎 (𝑖) .
We distinguish between race, 𝑎 (𝑖)0 , and𝐾 other attributes. Following
theory in the online dating literature [9, 19], we make two addi-
tional distinctions among attributes. First, we distinguish between
matching and competing attributes. For matching attributes, agents
try to find partners with similar values, while for the competing
attributes, they try to find partners with the highest possible values.
We assume that the protected attribute is matching.
Second, we distinguish between attributes visible only offline
as experiential attributes, and ones that are visible both online and
offline as searchable attributes. Examples of searchable attributes in-
clude personal interests and location. Sense of humor is an example
of experiential attribute [19]. Since people do not share everything
about themselves in their profiles [38], agents have a probability
of 50% to specify each searchable attribute on the platform. In the
example from Figure 1, the agent chose to specify their music taste,
but not their race. We describe the complete process of generating
attributes for new agents in the Supplementary Materials.
3.2.3 Stereotypes. Agents’ stereotypes encompass their beliefs of
which attribute combinations are more likely to be encountered [37].
We model the stereotypes of agent 𝑖 as a matrix𝐺 (𝑖) . This matrix
is initialized via a theoretically grounded model that is also based
on prior work. Specifically, when generating a new agent, we first
generate a sample of 300 agents having the same race, and 100
agents with a different race. The imbalance in sample sizes is moti-
vated by homophily: people are, in general, more likely to meet and
know people similar to themselves [46]. In addition to homophily,
we also model in-group favoritism, i.e. that people tend to look
favorably on people like them [30, 61]. To capture this in our model,
we follow prior agent-based models [35] and assume that agents
also have an initial degree of ethnocentrism. For example, as in
415
An Agent-based Model to Evaluate Interventions on Online Dating Platforms to Decrease Racial Homogamy FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
[35], if the degree of ethnocentrism is 0.3, then the agent will, on
average, expect 30% of the attributes of agents in the other-race
sample to have values that the agent does not like.
The Supplementary Materials contain full details on stereotype
initialization, and Section 3.5 on how stereotypes evolve over time.
3.2.4 Preferences. An agent’s preferences define which attributes
they believe are most important in a potential partner. We model
the preferences of agent 𝑖 as a weight vector,𝑤 (𝑖) ∈ Δ𝐾 . This vector
of preferences is in the 𝐾th simplex, i.e. its entries sum to one, thus
capturing the relative importance of different attributes in the eyes
of the agent. For example, a weight vector with 𝑤 (𝑖)
𝑗
= 1 and all
other entries of 0 corresponds to an agent who only considers the
𝑗th attribute to be important in a potential partner.
The preferences of agents influence and are influenced by two
different types of social norms, i.e. sociocultural regulations on
one’s preferences [39].2 First, while interacting online, an agent
impacts and is impacted by platform norms. Second, when in an
offline relationship, the agent preferences inform and are informed
by off-platform norms. Critically, then, in our model as in the real
world [39], agent’s preferences thus vary in part based on social
norms, which change as they move between the context of the
platform and their offline social life. At the same time, norms are
aggregations of the preferences of individuals, except, as we will
discuss, when explicit efforts are made by the platform to fix norms.
Agent preferences are initialized based on a procedure common
in the decision-making literature [12]. We note here that two param-
eters govern important aspects of this process. First, a parameter 𝛽
is used to capture the level of correlation between race and other
attributes. Second, 𝛾 captures the level of correlation between the
non-protected attributes. Varying these two parameters changes
the predictability of one attribute, given another. In our virtual ex-
periment, both 𝛽 and 𝛾 are changed. Most importantly, 𝛽 is varied
to reflect different degrees to which race can be inferred by agents
based on other available attributes when the agent chooses not to
display race in their online profile.
3.2.5 Knowledge of other agents. As they interact with another
agent, agents can become aware of the values of new attributes
of that agent. This knowledge is used to make decisions about,
e.g., whether to continue relationships. How agents acquire this
knowledge is discussed in Section 3.3.
3.3 Relationship Phases
Agents can be in one of three relationship phases: 1) searching, 2)
in an online relationship, or 3) in an offline relationship.3
3.3.1 Searching phase. When first entering the platform, an agent
is in the searching phase. An agent can search in two ways. First,
the agent can perform a query for potential partners using a search
interface. Second, the agent can look through messages in their
inbox that they have received from other agents. In one turn of the
simulation, agents can perform up to 30 search actions, mimicking
the typical length of a user’s session on an online dating website
[19, 22]. A search action represents looking at either a single search
2We discuss initialization of preferences and norms in the supplementary material.
3We make the simplifying assumption that an agent can only be in one of the before-
mentioned phases at one time, e.g. one cannot be both searching and dating offline.
result or a single message in the agent’s inbox. The agent randomly
decides which of these two actions to take. If the agent decides to
view a profile from their search result list, they look at the profile of
the next search result and decide whether or not they should send
that person a message. If the agent decides to view a message in
their inbox, they look at the oldest un-read message and consider
whether or not they should reply.
Search results are a randomly ordered subset of other agents
currently on the platform. Importantly, however, the agent decides
which other agents will appear in their search results. They do so by
filtering for potential dating partners. The agent filters on a single
attribute, the one that, on this turn, is most important to them (i.e.
for agent 𝑖 , the attribute with the highest value of𝑤 (𝑖) ). In Figure 1,
for example, interest in music is the most important factor for the
blue agent, and they hence use this as a filter. The blue agent is then
only shown profiles of other agents having a passion for music.
If the agent decides to reply to a message in their inbox, their
search ends, and the two agents involved proceed to an online
relationship phase. However, the agent can send as many initial
messages to agents in their search results as they would like. An
unsuccessful search is considered to be a turn in which the agent is
not interested in answering any of the messages they have looked
at, and in which they did not find at least half of the profiles they’ve
looked at interesting enough to send an initial message. Too many
unsuccessful search turns would make the agent exit the platform.
3.3.2 Online relationship phase. After answering or getting a reply
to an initial message, the agent moves to an Online Relationship
Phase with another agent. While in this phase, in each iteration the
two agents within the relationship have an online interaction. Dur-
ing this interaction, three things happen. First, agents may update
their knowledge about the attributes of the other. Going back to the
example in Figures 1 and 2, when entering the relationship, the blue
agent only knows the value of the green agent’s interest in music.
After one interaction, they have also learned the self-identified race
of the green agent. Second, agents update their stereotypes based
on what they learn about the other; see Section 3.5. Finally, agents
decide whether or not to continue the relationship. If both decide
to continue, the interaction is positive, and the relationship will
continue with a new interaction in the next iteration. Otherwise,
the interaction is negative, and the relationship ends.
After deciding on whether or not to continue the relationship,
the preferences of agents are updated based on whether the inter-
action was positive or negative (see Section 3.5) and the turn of
the agents ends. If the agents have decided to end the relationship,
their tolerance to failed relationships decreases. Agents will exit the
platform if this tolerance reaches 0, and otherwise they return to
searching. If the agents decide to continue the relationship, they
either continue the online relationship, or, if the relationship has
lasted long enough, move to the Offline Relationship Phase.
3.3.3 Offline relationship phase. The turn of an agent in an Offline
Relationship Phase progresses similarly to the Online one, with
two key differences. First, if the interaction was positive, the agents
either continue the relationship (as above); however, if the relation-
ship lasts for 30 iterations, the agents then exit the platform into a
long-term relationship. Second, while offline, in each iteration there
416
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Trovato and Tobin, et al.
is a fixed 1/7 chance of interacting. This means that, in expectation,
people in offline relationships meet once per week [10, 47].
3.4 Agent Decision-Making
In the Searching phase, agents answer the questions (posed to them-
selves), "should I reply to/send an initial message to this agent?".
When in a relationship, the agent answers questions of the type
"should I continue being in a relationship with this agent?". Both
of these are yes/no questions, and agents use the same decision
function, described below, to answer them.
Suppose that agent 𝑖 must make a decision about sending a
message or continuing a relationship with agent 𝑗 . We assume
agent 𝑖 may know only an incomplete vector of agent 𝑗 ’s attributes,
which we call 𝑎 ( 𝑗) . We use 𝑎 ( 𝑗) ⊆ 𝑎 if 𝑎 extends the incomplete
vector of attributes 𝑎 ( 𝑗) , i.e. 𝑎 is a complete vector that has the same
entries as 𝑎 ( 𝑗) on the known attributes. Lastly, for the agents 𝑖, 𝑗
there is some time value, 𝑡 , capturing the amount of time spent in
that specific phase with one another (for somebody in the searching
phase or who just started an online or an offline relationship, 𝑡 = 0).
In making decisions, agents consider a) the time spent so far
with the other agent and b) how well the attributes of the other
agent align with their own attributes and preferences. Time is an
important predictor for breakups, as agents that have stayed longer
in a relationship are less likely to interrupt their relationship. For
example, people tend to be especially selective in their first offline
date together [40]. Consequently, using the above introduced nota-
tion, the probability that agent 𝑖 answers yes to a decision question
regarding agent 𝑗 is given by the following sigmoid function:
P(yes) = 1
1 + exp
(
−E
[
𝑤 (𝑖) · 𝑠 (𝑖) (𝑎) |𝑎 ( 𝑗) ⊆ 𝑎
]
− 𝑡
) .
Two aspects of the above equation require further explanation.
First, the expected value is taken over all possible attribute combina-
tions extending the incomplete information of 𝑖 over the attributes
of 𝑗 . The probability of each combination is given by the current
stereotypes of 𝑖 . Thus, 𝑖’s stereotypes impact what they expect the
unknown attributes of 𝑗 to be. Second, the function 𝑠 (𝑖) (𝑎) is an
attribute scoring function that for a given agent and complete at-
tribute vector returns a vector with entries 1, 0, and −1 depending
on whether each attribute is viewed as good, neutral, or bad. Agents
see a matching attribute value as being good if it is the same as
their own and bad if it is different. Similarly, they see a competing
attribute value as good if it is larger than their own, neutral if it is
equal, and bad if it is lower. The Supplementary Material provides
a formalization of this scoring function.
3.5 Belief, Preferences, and Norm Updates
Agents’ stereotypes, preferences, and the norms of the platform
change on each iteration.
3.5.1 Agent Stereotype Updates. Recall that when generating an
agent, we construct 𝐺 (𝑖) , a sample of attribute combinations they
have encountered so far. After each interaction, an agent observes
a new combination of attributes. If that observation is a complete
list of attributes, they add it to the sample. Otherwise, they find the
probabilities of each possible complete combination of attributes
that could extend the observed one and adds a proportional fraction
to each of these categories. For example, consider somebody that
observes the combination (1, 0,⊥) after an interaction, and their
sample was 25 observations for (1, 0, 0) and 75 for (1, 0, 1). Post-
interaction, their sample changes to 25.25 and 75.75.
3.5.2 Norm and Preference Updates. Preferences and on-platform
norms both change during each iteration. First, agent preferences
change according to their interactions based on a) whether the
interaction was positive or negative and b) the attributes of agents.
For example, a positive interaction with somebody of the same race
will change the preference of the agent by increasing the preference
of an agent to date someone of the same race. In contrast, a negative
interaction with someone of the same race will make the agent less
likely to seek out a same-race partner in the future.
At the end of each simulation turn, norms and preferences are up-
dated to reflect their convergence [39]. Specifically, the on-platform
norm gets closer to the average preference of agents on the plat-
form, and the preferences of agents are updated by getting closer
to the respective norm. Each update is carried out by taking convex
combinations between the original value of the norms (preferences)
and the values of the influencing preferences (norms). The extent to
which norms determine preferences, and vice versa, is set via model
parameters. See the supplementary information for more details
on how these updates are made, as well as details on initialization.
4 VIRTUAL EXPERIMENT
We now describe how we use our model to explore three different
classes of interventions outlined by Hutson et al. [34]. In Section 4.1,
we operationalize these interventions, which are also listed in Ta-
ble 2. We then discuss how we vary model parameters to evaluate
the effectiveness of these interventions under different assump-
tions about the underlying society. Finally, we detail the outcome
measures we use to understand the impacts of these interventions.
4.1 Interventions
Hutson et al. [34] suggest three places where platforms might inter-
vene to reduce bias and discrimination on intimate platforms: 1) at
the search, sort, and filter level, 2) at the matching algorithm level,
and 3) at the community policy and messaging level. Here, we focus
on the first and the last, and leave out the second for two reasons.
First, not all platforms use matching algorithms, and even when
they do, the algorithm differs substantially. Second, the literature on
the possible algorithm to implement is vast [1, 8, 23, 33, 58, 63, 65].
Consequently, there are many different alternatives to substitute
the existing matching algorithm with. A comparison between these
various procedures is beyond the scope of this paper.
4.1.1 Filtering Interventions. The ease of filtering out people based
on their attributes when searching for potential partners in online
systems may exacerbate racial homogamy in two ways: 1) it reduces
the diversity in search results and 2) it makes race a legitimate basis
for decisions [7, 34, 38]. The first suggested solution to mitigate this
problem by Hutson et al. [34] is to purposefully introduce diversity
into search results, e.g. by removing the ability to filter by certain
attributes entirely. We refer to any intervention along these lines as
a filter intervention. We consider four different filter interventions,
comparing them to a baseline of traditional platform behaviors.

Table 2: The three types of Interventions, the baselines for
each, and the different intervention conditions we test.
Intervention Description
Filtering Interventions
Strong Baseline. Only see others with the preferred attribute value
on the most important attribute.
Strong non-race Strong filtering, if not on race. Otherwise, Strong filter
on second most important.
Weak Also shows profiles with unknown values on most im-
portant attribute
Weak non-race Weak filtering, but not on Race.
Off No filtering allowed.
Attribute Intervention
5 attributes Each agent has the protected attribute, plus one of each
kind of attribute
9 attributes Each agent has the protected attribute, plus two of each
kind of attribute
Norm Intervention
Off Baseline. On-platform norms are an average of agent
preferences
On On-platform norms are fixed to 0 on race, encouraging
agents not to consider it
As explained above, without any intervention, agents will filter
their searches for romantic partners by the attribute they consider to
bemost important.We refer to this baseline option as Strong filtering.
From this baseline, Hutson et al. [34] note that interventions to
reduce racial homogamy can be constructed along two dimensions.
First, we can restrict the possibility of filtering on race entirely. To
signal such an intervention we add a "non-race" label to the filter
name. Second, we can introduce diversity by showing profiles of
agents who did not provide the given attribute in their profile. We
label filtering strategies that only include the desired setting of the
given attribute as "Strong," and those that also include potential
partners who simply do not fill out a value for this attribute as
"Weak". Combining interventions on these two dimensions gives
three more filtering options, namely Strong non-race, Weak, and
Weak non-race.We also add a fourth intervention where no filtering
is allowed at all, on any attribute, i.e. the "Off" filtering option.
The five filtering conditions are most clearly stated with an
example. Consider the agents in Figure 1. Let us assume the platform
opts to use Strong filtering. Further, let us assume that the blue
agent’s strongest preference is for a romantic partner that is the
same race. In this case, the blue agent will search for others with the
same race, and will see only other potential partners who publicly
self-identified with that race on the platform. If the platform had
Weak filtering, the agent would also see any other agents who a)
have the same self-identified race or b) do not specify any race on
the platform. If the platform employed Strong non-race filtering, the
platform would not allow the agent to search by race at all. The
agent would therefore use their second strongest preference (say,
music), to perform their search. Weak non-race follows similarly,
and in the Off condition, agents would simply not be able to filter at
all. Finally, note that we have described the process with a matching
attribute; for competing attributes, agents are always assumed to
search for other agents who hold the desired attribute.
4.1.2 Attribute Intervention. Removing filtering options can make
it harder for agents to find the partners they desire. A suggested so-
lution by Hutson et al. [34] to mitigate this problem is to add or give
additional attention to new non-race attributes on which agents can
filter (e.g. political view or smoking preferences). We refer to this
intervention as anAttribute Intervention. In our model, this interven-
tion is implemented by increasing the number of dating-relevant
attributes from a baseline of 5 to a total of 9, i.e. from having one
non-racial attribute of each type, to having two of them.4
4.1.3 Norm Intervention. The final intervention from Hutson et al.
[34] that we model are attempts to change or outline platform
norms. Hutson et al. [34] suggest that different community poli-
cies, such as introducing pledges, educating users on the effect of
expressing racial preferences, and detailing the disparities faced
by racial minorities, can encourage social norms to date interra-
cially. Norms, in turn, are known to be perhaps the most powerful
mechanism for changing discriminatory behaviors [62]. In our ex-
periment, the platform norm intervention fixes the value of the
on-platform norm for the race attribute to 0. This means that agents,
via the link between norms and agent preferences, are encouraged
not to consider race at all in their decisions. Differently from the
baseline condition, when on-platform norms are updated to reflect
the average of preferences, the value on the race dimension does
not change and continues to be 0 (see the Supplemental Material).
4.2 Assumptions about Society
Table 1 lists the model parameters we vary or keep constant in
our virtual experiment. As we will show, consideration of these
parameters is critical to understanding how well claims about in-
tervention effects generalize to different assumptions about society.
At the same time, a full exploration of the parameter space is infea-
sible. We take a three-pronged approach to addressing this. First,
as noted in the table, many of these parameter and their values
are theoretically grounded and/or empirically informed by prior
work. Second, we engaged in sensitivity testing, described in the
appendix, across a range of values for all parameters. Finally, for
our virtual experiment, we fixed parameters that did not appear
to have significant impacts on model outcomes. For parameters
that did appear to have an effect, we select a default value for each
(coloured in red in Table 1); when varying one such parameter, we
keep the others at their default values.
As shown in Table 1, we vary five model parameters in our sim-
ulation. First, tolerance to unsuccessful search turns, which allows
us to see how results change if agents are more or less tolerant to
seeing undesired profiles and messages while browsing. Second,
we vary racial bias in the out-platform norms, capturing how much
importance society puts on same-race relationships compared to
the other attributes of individuals. Third, we vary the influence
norms have on preferences, i.e. the percentage of individual prefer-
ences explained by social norms. Fourth, we alter the initial degree
of ethnocentrism, which intuitively corresponds to the extent to
which agents are likely to prefer same-race relationships. The last
4As a reminder, attributes differ along two dimensions matching-competing and
searchable-experiential, thus giving 4 possible types. Note also that Hutson et al.
[34] additionally suggest a variant of this intervention, namely one based on the min-
imal group paradigm in social psychology [61]. We provide results for this similar
intervention in the supplemental material.

parameters we change are the levels of correlation between at-
tributes, i.e. 𝛽 and 𝛾 ; we test in turn scenarios with zero, low, mild,
and high correlations between race and the other attributes (𝛽), and
low and medium correlations between the other non-race attributes
(𝛾 ). Each simulation runs over 2000 iterations, which corresponds
roughly to a period of over 5 years. Moreover, we use 20 distinct
random seeds for each scenario, thus having a total of 3000 runs.
4.3 Outcomes
We treat racial heterogamy–the opposite of racial homogamy—as
the main outcome variable when studying the impact of the simu-
lated interventions on racial homogamy.5 We operationalize racial
heterogamy as the percentage of long-term relationships that are in-
terracial. However, a proportion-based measurement can of course
vary based on changes in the numerator or denominator. Thus, an
increase in racial heterogamy might be caused by a decrease in
efficiency, i.e. the overall number of long-term relationships, or an
increase in the number of interracial relationships. We therefore
investigate these two quantities separately as well.
Lastly, we provide two measures of user satisfaction. , which
are important for two reasons. First, profit-oriented decisions by
platforms depend in part on the number and, hence, also on the
happiness of users. This in turn suggests platforms may be less
likely to implement interventions which threaten these metrics.
Second, even if a platform was somehow persuaded to implement
such interventions, the free nature of the market permits unsatisfied
users to easily move to a different dating platform. To capture user
satisfaction, we use two measures informed by literature on online
dating [22]. First, we measure the percentage of time spent in an
offline relationship, relative to online dating phases. Second, we
measure the number of users who exit the platform because they
have exhausted their tolerance for unsuccessful online searches.
5 RESULTS
5.1 Average Effects on Racial Heterogamy
Each intervention proposed by [34] increases racial heterogamy.
However, as shown in Figure 3, the magnitude of these effects vary.
The largest positive effect of any intervention is the Strong non-
race filtering condition, i.e. when our simulated platform removes
the option of filtering searches by race but allows agents to search
on all other attributes. Doing so increases racial heterogamy from
10.5% to 18.3%. In contrast, a Weak filtering option increases the
percentage by 3.4% over the baseline.
Combining the Strong non-race filtering intervention with the
norm and attribute interventions further increase racial heterogamy.
However, the effects are non-additive. For example, the effect of the
norm intervention decreases after implementing a filtering inter-
vention. Applying the norm intervention to the baseline filtering
option results in a 4% increase in interracial relationships, while if
it is applied on top of a Strong non-race intervention, the impact
reduces to less than 3%. Finally, adding dating-relevant attributes
produces an additional and relatively stable increase of 2% to 3%.
These results suggest the potential of interventions on the platform,
but also that their impacts may quickly reach a saturation point.
5We do so since we would like to emphasize the positive nature of the proposed change.

intervention (x-axis), and depending on whether or not the
norm intervention is On (green lines, Xs as points) or Off
(blue lines, triangles as points) and whether or not the at-
tribute intervention is off (left subplot) or on (right subplot)
5.2 Effects on Total Number of Relationships
We also find that increases in racial heterogamy–the percent of
long term interracial relationships–are not solely due to an increase
in the number of interracial long-term relationships. Rather, as
depicted in the first part of Figure 4, most interventions are also
paired with a significant decrease in the overall number of long-
term relationships.
With respect to the filtering interventions, removing the ability
to filter by race causes an almost 20% drop in the total number of
long-term relationships. This happens, in short, because agents, and
people, often want to filter by race, whether they are conscious of
that fact or not [2]. Thus, removing this filter makes it harder to find
partners that agents desire. The attribute intervention causes this
decrease for a separate, non-obvious reason. Specifically, including
additional attributes makes the search space becomes more diverse,
thus making it harder to find the “right” partner. Most obviously,
with more attributes, the chance of two agents matching on all
attributes decreases.
Finally, with respect to the norm intervention, influencing the
preferences of agents by changing on-platform norms produces
fluctuating evaluation criteria, especially when paired with racially
biased offline norms. Agents enter the simulation with their own
potentially racially-biased preferences. As they interact on the plat-
form, their preferences slowly converge towards the racially unbi-
ased on-platform norm. However, when going through the offline
relationship phase, their preferences again adapt to the racially
biased societal (offline) norms, thus shifting the evaluation criteria
of agents again. These fluctuations means it takes longer to find
suitable partners; so, if the process extends over the tolerance of
agents for either bad recommendations or failed relationships, they
will exit the platform without entering a long-term relationship.
In our model, as in modern cultural sociological theory [49], then,
the impact of the norm intervention is therefore contingent on the
extent to which norms within the context of the platform permeate
to other normative context by way of individual preferences.
5.3 Effects on User Satisfaction
Our simulations suggest that most interventions, on average, will
decrease user satisfaction, especially filter interventions that do not

Figure 4: Number of total (left) and interracial (right) long-
term relationships (y-axis) for the filter conditions (x-axis)
and the norm intervention (Blue: off, Green: on). Results are
only shown without the attribute intervention
allow users to filter on race. However, the magnitude, and in select
cases, even the sign of these effects vary according to the settings
of the other interventions, and across the two metrics considered.
These findings present evidence that interventions can potentially
be carried out without decreasing user satisfaction, but that these
interventions typically are weaker (in terms of reducing racial
homogamy), that effects on one satisfaction metric may contradict
results on another, and that which combinations of interventions
are most effective is not obvious a priori.
Specifically, Figure 5a shows that filtering interventions, to vary-
ing degrees, all decrease the percentage of agent’s time spent in
offline relationships, and in doing so likely decrease user satis-
faction. The most drastic impacts are from the Strong non-race
intervention, where 19.0% of agents’ time is spent offline, as op-
posed to 24.2% in the baseline condition. This effect is, however,
mitigated when paired with the attribute intervention. This is likely
because agents become more satisfied with the non-race filtering
options they have available to them. Other interventions, while
less capable of reducing racial homogamy than the Strong non-race
filter, have a much more limited effect on user satisfaction.
These observations for time spent offline also appear when mea-
suring user satisfaction in term of the percentage of users who leave
the platform without a partner. As shown in Figure 5, however, cer-
tain filter interventions can actually increase user satisfaction along
this metric. Specifically, the use of Weak or no filtering can increase
satisfaction on this metric, because agents often do not report all of
their attributes, and thus including also the profiles with unknown
attribute-values lowers the chance of excluding possibly interesting
partners. Full descriptions of other patterns in Figures 5a and 5 are
included in the Supplemental Material.
5.4 Intervention Impacts under Different
Assumptions about Society
Finally, we explore how interventions fare under different assump-
tions about society. Broadly speaking, we find, as reflected in Fig-
ure 6, that interventions do have strong stand-alone beneficial
effects, but that their impact is diluted if certain, often reasonable,
assumptions about society are met.
The figure shows coefficients resulting from a linear regression
with racial heterogamy as the outcome variable, and all (centered

and scaled) model parameters in Table 1 and their pairwise inter-
actions as independent variables. For readability, Figure 6 only
includes the 10 coefficients with the strongest absolute effect. The
regression model fits the data quite well (𝑅2 = 0.83), indicating that
first- and second-order effects explain much of the dynamics of the
complex system we model, but also that the model cannot be fully
explained by phenomenon enumerable by theory alone.6
Filter interventions have the largest absolute effect on racial
heterogamy. On average, across all simulated societies, removing
the possibility to filter by race increases racial heterogamy by 7.65%

(CI = (7.43, 7.88))7. The Norm intervention also has a considerable
positive impact, as it alone induces an average increase of 3.95%
(CI = (3.73, 4.17)). The impact of these interventions reflects their
potential to have real and possibly lasting changes on society.
Not all interventions we tested, however, increase racial ho-
mogamy in the manner theorized by Hutson et al. [34]. Specifically,
we find that only matching (as opposed to competing) and search-
able (as opposed to experiential) attributes produce a meaningful
increase in racial heterogamy. Adding other types of attributes can
actually have negative effects, either in decreasing overall numbers
of relationships while not impacting the number of interracial rela-
tionships, or in simply leading to a decrease in racial heterogamy.8
These findings underscore the importance of using simulation to
think through the operationalization of potential interventions,
especially by combining various theoretical models (here, of inter-
vention and attribute types) into a single simulation model.
Other results in Figure 6 show, unsurprisingly, that different
assumptions about society reflect drastically different baselines
fromwhich this improvement might come. For example, we see that
racial heterogamy is significantly reduced as correlations between
race and the other attributes increase, and with an increase in racial
bias in off-platform norms. Perhaps most importantly, however,
Figure 6 reveals that intervention effects and societal conditions
can interact to change the effectiveness of an intervention. For
example, the Norm intervention is particularly effective when we
make the assumption that agent preferences are strongly impacted
by social norms. But, adding a non-race filtering option is less
effective with increased values of the 𝛽 parameter. Put another way,
the effectiveness of not allowing individuals to search by race on
an online platform is limited by the extent to which race is signaled
by, or correlated with, other attributes that the platform does allow
one to search on.
6 CONCLUSION
In their recent articles, Hutson et al. [34] and Anderson et al. [2]
present contrasting views on the extent to which online dating
platforms can intervene to impact long-term patterns of racial ho-
mogamy in online dating. In the present work, we developed an
agent-based modeling approach that synthesizes modern perspec-
tives in (cultural) sociology, the psychology of online dating, and
social computing to help us explore this debate.
Before discussing the implications of our work, we again ex-
plicitly call out two critical assumptions that our model makes.
While we allow race to co-vary with other individual attributes,
reflecting its multidimensional nature [57], our virtual experiment
does ultimately assume that race, and gender, are both binary, i.e.
that one can easily and completely specify an individual’s race or
gender. Doing so lends an aura of racial and gender determinism
to our work that FAccT scholars are rightfully skeptical of [27].
Our experiment also assumes that these variables are independent,
and thus ignores important intersectional identities. However, we
emphasize that these assumptions are made only in the present
virtual experiment, and are by no means hard-coded into our open
7Note that confidence intervals are provided here but should be cautiously interpreted,
as they can be made infinitely small simply by running additional simulations

source simulation framework. We hope that we and others can
therefore easily explore other constructions of race, dating, gender,
and sexual preference in future work.
These limitations in mind, our findings shed critical light on
the effectiveness and side effects of the interventions proposed by
Hutson et al. [34] in reducing racial homogamy, and ultimately
racial inequality. Our work implies that the extent to which these
interventions will be effective depends on four things. First, it de-
pends on what we assume about society. We find that some of the
proposed assumptions are effective only if we assume that people
are unable to infer (perceived) race from other cultural preferences
along which race can be performed online, an assumption that
is potentially untenable given what is known about correlations
between cultural attributes in general [15] and perceptions of race
in particular [21]. And, other interventions are effective only if we
assume that 1) the platform can significantly impact social norms
towards interracial dating on their site and that 2) these norms have
more significant effects on individuals than other “offline” norma-
tive structures (e.g. the family) that have historically encouraged
racial homogamy.
Second, it depends on what platforms, and society, are willing
to accept as sacrifice for progress on racial homogamy. Our model
makes explicit these potentially non-obvious tradeoffs, quantifying
how certain interventions to reduce racial homogamy have neg-
ative impacts on user satisfaction and rates of overall long-term
relationships. Third, it depends on how long one is willing to wait.
We find that changing on platform norms have a limited effect;
however, our model only studies short-term effects. Changes in
large-scale social norms can take much longer, and thus the payoff
of these normative interventions may exist only much further into
the future as on-platform norms influence agent preferences, which
in turn slowly reshape norms in other contexts. Finally, it depends
on what one’s ultimate goal is. If one’s ultimate goal is to increase
racial homogamy to any degree, our results provide evidence that
this is possible under a fairly wide range of assumptions. However,
if one’s goal is to eradicate racial homogamy, then interventions
at the platform level seem to hit a saturation point well below
true equality. These technological interventions will therefore al-
most certainly never be enough; they must be supplemented with
structural and normative social change beyond the platform.
While one could argue that these findings are post-hoc somewhat
obvious, our work is motivated by a disagreement in the existing
literature over the potential for platform intervention. This should
serve as an important reminder that everything is obvious once it
is observed [64], and we hope motivates the use of our approach
to other domains. Especially when unsuitable changes could have
large negative effects, constructing a model and simulating different
possible outcomes could help explore potential problems to those
interventions that emerge within a complex sociotechnical system.
