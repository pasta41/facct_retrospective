ABSTRACT
Smart weight scales offer bioimpedance-based body composition
analysis as a supplement to pure body weight measurement. Com-
panies such as Withings and Fitbit tout composition analysis as
providing self-knowledge and the ability to make more informed de-
cisions. However, these aspirational statements elide the reality that
these numbers are a product of proprietary regression equations
that require a binary sex/gender as their input. Our paper combines
transgender studies-influenced personal narrative with an analysis
of the scientific basis of bioimpedance technology used as part of
the Withings smart scale. Attempting to include nonbinary people
reveals that bioelectrical impedance analysis has always rested on
physiologically shaky ground. White nonbinary people are merely
the tip of the iceberg of those who may find that their smart scale
is not so intelligent when it comes to their bodies. Using body com-
position analysis as an example, we explore how the problem of
trans and nonbinary inclusion in personal health tech goes beyond
the issues of adding a third “gender” box or slapping a rainbow
flag on the packaging. We also provide recommendations as to how
to approach creating more inclusive technologies even while still
relying on exclusionary data.

1 INTRODUCTION
Kendra: As a nonbinary person who was assigned female at birth,
I’ve always had an uncomfortable relationship with my body weight.
To be honest, before I stepped on the Withings scale, I hadn’t weighed
myself in some time. But after undergoing some medical transition
steps, I found myself much more curious about what my body fat
percentage was. Especially since I have put on a fair amount of muscle,
I was interested to see how the numbers matched or didn’t match my
self perception.
Because of this discomfort with weight numbers, I asked Maggie
to make a profile for me when I was getting started with the scale.
She started going through the registration flow for a new user, and
quickly encountered a roadblock - the system required a gender.
Wait, that’s not right. It didn’t require a gender, it required you to
pick one of two images labeled gender - a person wearing pants or a
person wearing a skirt (see Figure 1). When Maggie asked me which
one I preferred, I told her to pick one and not tell me.
When I did finally step on the scale (with my shiny new profile), I
looked at the numbers and felt...well, some sort of way. To be honest,
I’m happier with my body now than I remember ever being before,
but the numbers seemed very off.
The next morning, we were talking about the scale at breakfast,
and that was when Maggie first told me that the fat percentage was
an estimation based on a technique called bioelectrical impedance
analysis (BIA). There was an equation behind that number - it didn’t
actually measure my body fat percentage directly. I was shocked, and
asked how that related to my gender. We decided to do some testing.
When Maggie changed my “gender” from skirt-wearing to pants-
wearing, my body fat percentage dropped 10% points. 10! The huge
difference seemed to confirm everything I’d thought about the numbers
feeling wonky. But which one was right? Or failing that, which one
closer? Could we look at how the algorithm calculated the percentage
in order to see which one was likely to be more accurate for me?
Maggie: Kendra’s reaction to the scale was an interesting expe-
rience because I realized that the knowledge I had about how BIA
worked was non-obvious to anyone not familiar with the tech. I had
already been thinking about how sex is often coded in the underlying
BIA equations as 1 or 0 because I had given a guest lecture about it
recently, but I hadn’t fully thought through the implications for trans
and nonbinary people.
Seeing the numbers on the scale jump by so much was jarring. We
talked a lot about how to interpret the results and what the exact
percentages really mean. There is a little progress bar on the scale
that indicated that the numbers (regardless of gender) were above

the “normal range.” But that normal range itself appears to be a
“normal range” for an athlete because we were both well above that
line. In terms of making the scale work for Kendra, the answer I was
proposing was to pick skirt-wearing or pants-wearing and then track
that number over time.
Kendra’s interest in using the Withings smart scale, and figuring
out what “gender option” was right drove us to reexamine how BIA
works as a technology, and how assumptions about gender and sex
are built into the fundamental equations that drive the algorithmic
models used for estimating body fat percentage.
This paper, the result of that analysis, combines transgender
studies-influenced personal narratives with an analysis of the sci-
entific basis behind the bioimpedance technology used as part of
the Withings smart scale. With these different forms of knowledge,
we explore how the problem of trans and nonbinary inclusion in
personal health tech goes beyond adding a third “gender” option
or slapping a rainbow flag on some packaging. Rather, nonbinary
exclusion is the tip of an iceberg of flawed assumptions and exclu-
sionary clinical testing, resulting in algorithms that are advertised
for self-knowledge but prove to allow anything but.
2 BACKGROUND
This paper draws on previous work related to self-tracking, trans-
gender studies, human-computer interaction, and the study of sex
and gender in biomedical research. In this section, we provide a
brief summary of related work in these disciplines to situate our
findings.
While the Withings weight scale is not the first commercially
available scale to estimate body fat percentage, the device was one
of the original “smart” (i.e. connected) weight scales [3]. The device
was first sold in the early 2010s at the beginning of a surge of interest
in self-tracking and the advent of the “quantified self” movement
[47, 55, 57]. The quantified self movement included a variety of
stakeholders including individual self-trackers, organizations such
as Quantified Self, companies and toolmakers, academic researchers,
and physicians (with considerable overlap between these categories)
[9]. Participants are broadly interested in the capabilities of self-
tracking to provide unique, actionable, and personalized insights
[50, 82]. Self-trackers engage deeply with their data through a
process sociologist Deborah Lupton refers to as “data sense-making”
[49]. Many self-trackers believe that data can “speak for itself”
and should be involved in medical care [27, 59]. However, the use
of data collected from commercial “wellness” devices such as the
Withings scale or activity trackers like Fitbits is controversial as
these devices don’t always perform well in third-party validations,
and often involve proprietary algorithms and metrics (e.g. steps,
sleep scores).
Previous research investigating self-tracking devices and wear-
able monitors has shown that these devices, like devices in other
categories, are designed primarily for an unmarked user [12, 15].
That is, the user is assumed to be a White, cisgender, non-disabled
man. Cifor and Garcia, for example, use duoethnography to eval-
uate gendered assumptions in the design and app of the Jawbone
UP3 fitness tracker. They illustrate that while the device itself ap-
peared “genderless,” the design of the device and the app reinforced
masculinist values such as competition [12]. Such issues are also
present in the design of algorithms - for example, Fitbit devices
count steps less reliably at slower gait speeds and with softer steps,
which decreases step count accuracy for older people or people
with mobility related disabilities [24, 37]. Early implementations of
the hardware and algorithms used to estimate heart rate on wear-
ables were less accurate for users with darker skin tones [31, 69],
though recent evidence suggests these disparities may have been
addressed by improvements to the device’s algorithms [6].
The development of algorithms without a diverse set of users
creates algorithmic exclusion. Populations are excluded from the
use of algorithmic tools because they were not included as part
of the original data used in development, or because information
was not gathered in such a way as to make their needs visible.
This algorithmic exclusion means that the performance of these
algorithms for individuals not in the original dataset are unknown;
the practical implication is that these algorithms likely work less
well for those not included in the original dataset. Algorithmic
343

exclusion can have real world impacts as individuals rely more
and more on these data, especially when these data are used by
physicians. For example, pulse oximeter devices that measure blood
oxygenation (using a more involved technique similar to that used
by wearables manufacturers for measuring heart rate) overestimate
blood oxygenation in individuals with darker skin tones [7, 25].
Renewed interest in these disparities during the COVID-19 epidemic
led to a study that showed that Black patients had nearly three
times the frequency of occult hypoxemia (oxygen depravation) that
was not detected by pulse oximetry than White patients [52, 71],
potentially leading to higher mortality rates for Black patients when
the seriousness of their COVID-19 cases were underestimated.
These issues have not escaped notice within communities that
build technological tools. There has been increasing discussion in
different design communities about how to create technology that
is more inclusive and/or addresses some of the disparities discussed
above. In human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelli-
gence (AI) research, for example, there have been efforts including
analytical reviews, software analysis of datasets, and guidelines
about increasing “gender sensitivity” [11, 33, 39, 63, 64] and more
intersectional approaches to addressing disparities, such as the in-
tersection of gender and race [10, 62]. There have been multiple
guides and recommendations for including transgender people in
user interface design [11, 53] and in surveys [74]. These recom-
mendations include allowing all individuals to self-identify their
gender, not assuming binary gender, using the language users use,
and protecting the privacy of participants. In the case of dealing
with medical research and “embodiment,” the guidelines recom-
mend measuring physiological parameters such as hormone levels
directly, rather than assuming them based on gender.
However, embodiment is a tricky line to draw. When one consid-
ers the terms “sex” and “gender,” the common assumption is that
sex is biological and gender is social. If there is any relationship
between the two, it is assumed that sex influences gender, and trans-
gender and intersex people are seen as outliers whose needs vary
from “normal” populations. However, Springer et al. argue that it is
sex that cannot be purely decoupled from social factors (i.e. gender)
[75]. A “biosocial turn” is now beginning in the study of sex and
gender [68]. Many mechanisms that were previously thought to
be due to biological “sex” differences, are in fact mechanisms that
involve differences based on socialization that manifest in biological
differences. Springer et al. recommend using “gender” to refer to
social relations and gender roles and the term “sex/gender” to refer
to those biological and biosocial factors associated with individual
physiology. In this paper, we will use the terms sex/gender and
gender, unless we are referring to how these terms are used in a
specific work.
3 APPROACH
Our work draws heavily from transgender studies as an approach,
while having some similarity to Black feminist methods, specifically
Jennifer Nash’s love politics in the form of witnessing [56]. We
include conversations between the two of us throughout throughout
the paper. Personal narrative, especially dialogue, can help uncover
“common pain points and overlooked opportunities” [12]. Where
duoethnography, used by previous studies, is a researchmethod that
employs personal narrative to “simultaneously generate, interpret,
and articulate data” about a shared experience [58], we include
personal narratives throughout this paper to combine, in the words
of Susan Stryker, “the embodied experience of the speaking subject”
(i.e. our experiences using the weight scale) with “the specialized
domain of scholarship”, (i.e. the specifics of the theory and practice
of BIA for at home body composition monitoring) [72, 77]. Personal
narrative allows for a starting point to a broader conversation about
smart weight scales and the implications the system and algorithm
design have for technology and biomedical research more broadly.
We are approaching this topic as a White nonbinary person
(Kendra), and as a White cisgender woman (Maggie). Neither of us
are disabled in ways that are likely to affect our readings from or
interactions with the Withings scale. Both of us have considerable
background in technology and gender. Kendra is a lawyer teaching
at a technology clinic who also teaches in transgender studies. They
have, at times, engaged in self-tracking, although not previously
aroundweight. Maggie is an assistant professor at a small liberal arts
school where she teaches digital/embedded systems and inclusive
engineering design. Her research involves using bioimpedance to
help patients manage fluid overload. She is also a self-tracker and
has presented her work at several Quantified Self conferences.
4 BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS
Critical analysis of the sort that we deploy in this paper requires
the knowledge of how the measurement technology inside smart
weight scales works. In this section, we present a background on
Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). We should note, however,
that because the specific testing and equations used by the With-
ings scale are not publicly available, this background will leverage
knowledge from public and peer-reviewed sources and may or
may not reflect the specific approaches that the Withings or other
consumer-facing scales employ.
At the most basic level, the body can be divided into two main
“compartments:” fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) [40, 43, 46].
FM includes all the fat in the human body, including what we think
of as body fat and also visceral fat around vital organs. FFM is the
rest of the tissue; it is about 73% water, about 7% bone, and the rest
is proteins.
BIA leverages the fact that the water in FFM is conductive; by
driving a small, painless current through the body via a pair of
electrodes (in weight scales these are two of the electrodes on the
scale), the resulting voltage can be measured by another pair of
electrodes (also on the scale) and related to the electrical properties
of the underlying tissue.
If one assumes the body is a homogeneous cylinder with cross-
sectional area A, the measured resistance 𝑅 (defined as the real part
of the measured voltage divided by the current) is equal to:
𝑅 =
𝜌𝐿
𝐴
(1)
where 𝜌 is the conductivity of the cylinder, 𝐿 is the length of
the cylinder, and 𝐴 is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. Most
BIA equations assume that 𝐿 is proportional to the body height 𝐻 .
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 𝐿/𝐿, the resistance can
344
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Kendra Albert and Maggie Delano
be related to the inverse of the volume, assuming that 𝑉 = 𝐿 ×𝐴:
𝑅 =
𝜌𝐿
𝐴
· 𝐿
𝐿
=
𝜌𝐿2
𝑉
(2)
If one moves the volume to the other side, there is then:
𝑉 =
𝜌𝐿2
𝑅
(3)
This volume 𝑉 corresponds to what is called the “total body
water” or the volume of all water in the body, which is assumed
to be about 73% of the volume of the FFM. If one multiplies this
volume by the presumed density of the FFM to obtain the FFM, the
FM and body fat percentage (BF%) can then be calculated as:
𝐹𝑀 =𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 − 𝐹𝐹𝑀 (4)
𝐵𝐹% =
𝐹𝑀
𝐹𝑀 + 𝐹𝐹𝑀
· 100 (5)
4.1 Assumptions of BIA
The methods described above require a number of assumptions
related to the body. In order for these assumptions to be valid, the
resistivity 𝜌 of the measured volume must be homogeneous, and
the cross-sectional area must be constant throughout the body such
that 𝑉 = 𝐿 × 𝐴. The assumption that the FFM is 73% water must
also hold, along with the assumed density of the FFM. Finally, it
must be assumed that the current penetrates through the whole
body in a uniform manner such that the estimated volume is truly
reflective of the total body water, and not just a fraction of it.
Of course, these assumptions are not realistic; the body is not
a single homogeneous cylinder with precisely known body com-
position. Instead, BIA leverages different variables that correlate
with “gold standard” estimations of the FFM to estimate the FFM
based on the BIA itself. An example BIA equation for estimating
FFM might look like the following: [44]:
𝐹𝐹𝑀 = −4.104+(0.518 × 𝐻2/𝑅)+(0.231 ×𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡)+(0.130 × 𝑋 )
+ (4.229 × 𝑠𝑒𝑥 :𝑚𝑒𝑛 = 1,𝑤𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛 = 0) (6)
This equation involves a number of key terms: the𝐻2/𝑅 term, the
weight term, the 𝑋 term (reactance or imaginary part of measured
bioimpedance), and sex. Each of these terms is associated with a
coefficient in front (along with a constant at the beginning of the
equation) that are calculated based on the best fit of the regression
equation that minimizes the error between the estimation via BIA
and the estimation via the gold standard for the population under
test (in this case, the gold standard used was a technology called
dual x-ray absorptiometry or DXA).
Precisely which parameters are included in the regression equa-
tions and their corresponding coefficients depends on the popu-
lation used to calculate the equations and researcher preference.
Other researchers also include factors such as the age of the partic-
ipants and whether or not participants are athletes [40]. In some
cases these parameters are all incorporated into a single equation
(such as the one above that has “options” for participant sex), or mul-
tiple equations are generated, such as one for “lean” participants,
one for “average” participants, and one for “obese” participants
[66].
Parameters included in FFM estimation equations often do a lot
of “work” and their role is not always clearly understood. These
parameters and their coefficients “stand in” for things such as body
density, which can vary depending on both factors included in the
equations and those typically excluded from the equations such as
ethnicity. For example, age is sometimes included as a parameter
because there tends to be a decrease in FFM and an increase in FM
with age, and sex is included because males on average have lower
FM than females. We unpack these assumptions and coefficient
parameters in more depth in Section 6.
5 HOW BIA IS MARKETED
Kendra: Of course, I didn’t know how BIA worked before using the
scale. Nor would looking at the Withings website have revealed any
of the fraughtness of BIA to me - when I look at their ads now, they
call the technology “body composition.” It’s not obvious from their
advertising that it’s estimating body fat percentage based on a set of
assumptions and an algorithm, rather than providing an individual-
level ground truth. If you don’t know how the technology works, it’s
actually quite easy to draw the conclusion that the scale just magically
knows your actual body fat percentage.
Even if I review the “technical specifications,” the information con-
tained requires quite a bit of context to determine that what is produced
isn’t an individualized number. The bullet points say “Bioelectrical
Impedance Analysis / Athlete and non-athlete mode / Unit: body fat %,
total body water %, muscle mass kg or lb, bone mass kg or lb.” There’s
nothing there that tells me, as an end-user without a lot of expertise in
BIA, that it’s engaged in an estimation based on plugging particular
values into an equation.
That brings me to the question, Maggie, what were you thinking
when you bought the Withings scale? How did the body composition
stuff play into it?
Maggie: I’ve had the scale for a long time - since 2012. That was
also the time when the number of people talking about self-tracking
was growing, and organizations such as Quantified Self were facilitat-
ing some of the first meetups and conferences in this area. Quantified
Self emphasized self-knowledge through numbers, often using the
frame “self-research” or “personal science” [82]. Over the next few
years, the idea of self-tracking would become very hyped, and an
entire commercial ecosystem Whitney Erin Boesel dubs “quantified
self” (i.e. little q, little s, vs big Q, big S) was formed [9]. Looking
back at my data, my first weigh in was March 23rd, 2012. I wanted to
learn more about the tech that was out there and see what I could do
to make sense of things, and was also inspired by a Quantified Self
“Show & Tell” talk by Amelia Greenhall about how she weighed herself
everyday and sustained her weight loss long term [30]. I was excited
about the possibility of self-tracking and consistent habits improving
my fitness and my life. I wanted to learn more and then translate that
knowledge to help others.
Kendra: This idea of self-knowledge is really exciting. That’s what
I was hoping for when I stepped on the scale as well - some numbers
to help me quantify what I was feeling about my body. But of course,
that’s not what I got. As a White nonbinary person, what I learned
is that this tech isn’t build for me - in part because of the choices
that technology companies make, and in part because of the failure
to meaningfully account for transgender experience as part of the
345

underlying clinical testing. And it’s worse for non-White nonbinary
or intersex folks, who are both not represented in the studies in terms
of sex/gender or race/ethnicity. So much for smart scales.
6 CRITIQUES OF BIA
Many limitations of BIA have been well established in the medical
literature [40], though some researchers argue that the techniques
are still appropriate to use under the correct circumstances [80].
Researchers suggest cautionwhen using BIA, especially whenwork-
ing with populations that have altered body composition, such as
patients with fluid overload. In these cases, some researchers have
developed equations specifically for a particular patient population,
or have used alternative methods of body composition assessment
that don’t rely on regressions (see e.g. [38]).
A major challenge with body composition using BIA is that the
two compartment model of “fat mass” (FM) vs “fat free mass” (FFM)
inherently requires assumptions about the composition of the two
different compartments (in addition to other assumptions such
as homogeneous composition as discussed previously in Section
4.1). Uniformity of the FM is a fairly reasonable assumption across
individuals [51], but assumptions about the composition of the FFM
are not [16]. Additionally, when using the regression equations, the
assumptions about the composition of the FFM are obscured into
the coefficients associated with the included variables such as age,
weight, and sex.
Because the linear regressions are optimized at a population
level and most studies do not examine the accuracy of the estima-
tions at an individual level, there is no guarantee that a specific
equation is accurate for any given individual. Additionally, once
one begins to consider any individual that is not perfectly matched
for the population that was used to create the equations, the role of
these variables becomes increasingly murky but also increasingly
important in order to design equations that work for populations
historically not included in the populations used to generate the
equations. This includes non-White people, trans and nonbinary
people, intersex people, people with chronic illnesses, and those at
the intersections of these categories.
6.1 Unpacking “Sex”
We begin with the assumptions and role of “sex” in the equations.1
Sex in BIA is either coded as 0 for female and 1 for male (effectively
changing the offset of the equations, as in Equation 6) or there
are separate equations created for male participants and female
participants, as in Sun et al. [78]. What the literature means by
“male” or “female” is unclear, and these terms are often confounded
with gender identities of “man” and “woman” as in Equation 6. As
we discussed in Section 2, “sex” as a concept is just as fraught and
contingent as gender [18, 23, 75]. This is not a problem unique to
(or caused by) the existence of trans (or intersex) people.
Although the methods by which “sex” was evaluated in the BIA
literature is unclear, it is common for reported sex to be a partici-
pant’s sex assigned at birth. And “sex assigned at birth” is generally
only a proxy for someone’s external genitalia at birth, which is only
one of the many characteristics that are often encompassed under
1Weuse the term “sex” here given that this is the term used by the researchers. However,
sex and gender are entangled as described in Section 2.
the word sex [18, 23]. Others include hormone balance, chromoso-
mal makeup, and internal reproductive organs. We could not find
an example of a study that produces BIA estimates that discusses
what sexual characteristics they round up to a determination of sex,
and it is generally not clear how the identification of sex was made
(i.e. whether self-identified or identified by the researchers). This
lack of specificity is one of the first and most significant barriers to
creating a more inclusive algorithm for transgender people. Given
how large the sample sizes were for some of the populations used
to create BIA equations (upwards of 5,000 in [45]), it is statistically
unlikely that no transgender people were involved. But we don’t
know how they were accounted for or counted in the calculations.
The use of “sex” itself is also a “stand in” for other parameters.
What the researchers presumably intend is for “sex” to stand in
for the roughly dimorphic variation in body composition between
those assigned male at birth and those assigned female at birth [18].
However, it is not the fact that a person is assigned male at birth
(i.e., they have genital erectile tissue of a certain size) that makes
those assigned male at birth have lower FM on average compared
with those assigned female at birth. In fact, FM and the distribution
of fat may actually be biosocial phenomena: they may depend on
both sex AND gender (sex/gender). For example, one effect of larger
quantities of testosterone is changes in fat distribution and increases
in muscle production, resulting in lower body fat percentages [73].
However, most research into sex differences in body composition
do not explore other explanations, such as the differences in diet
between men and women in some cultural contexts [36, 61]. The
BIA literature also does not disaggregate sociocultural context that
might be caught up in the word “sex”, nor account for the myriad
ways in which someone assigned male at birth might not match the
presumed physiological composition associated with those assigned
male at birth on average.
With only two sex or gender options, some intersex and most
nonbinary users experience what D.E. Wittkower has termed a
dysaffordance – they have to pretend to be something they are not
in order to access the service [15, 81]. The lack of transparency in
the BIA equations makes it difficult to tell exactly what adjustments
might need to be made to make equations more inclusive, or to at
the least advise individuals as to which “sex” they should choose
when using consumer technologies that incorporate BIA. On the
other hand, the current setup of the Withings scale that asks for
user gender may actually produce more accurate results for trans
women and trans men who have undergone gender-affirming hor-
mone therapy, as their body composition may resemble that of a cis
woman or cis man, rather than their sex assigned at birth [41, 73].
6.2 Other Issues With Published Studies
White nonbinary or intersex people, despite experiencing a dysaf-
fordance, may be better off than their siblings of color because
the composition of the study populations used in BIA equations in
the Withings scale are unclear, and there is no way to enter racial
or ethnic information.2 The majority of measurement studies in-
volving BIA include primarily Caucasian subjects and assume that
2We use both the terms race and ethnicity because the literature is mixed on which
are relevant factors, likely because of the entanglement of biological and social factors
similar to sex/gender as discussed in Sections 2 and 6.
346
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Kendra Albert and Maggie Delano
Caucasian subjects are to serve as a “reference” for other ethnici-
ties.3 This is an issue because body composition can vary among
ethnic and racial groups due to the environment, diet, cultural fac-
tors, and anthropomorphic measurements such as limb length and
body size [19]. Researchers or device manufacturers interested in
using BIA equations validated in a Caucasian population therefore
need to cross-validate the equations in the population of study.
As with sex, race or ethnicity is likely standing in as a proxy for
some other variables, such as environmental racism, socioeconomic
status, or some actual relationship between FFM composition and
certain genetic factors. Some studies suggest that ethnicity specific
compensations are needed to use body composition equations in
different ethnic groups [13, 65], whereas other studies have shown
that stratification based on adiposity (i.e. body fat percentage) is
more important than race [4]. Regardless, cross-validation studies
are necessary to ensure that the assumptions of equations produce
accurate results for all populations.
Another major issue with BIA is that the regression equations
themselves are validated against “gold standards” that in turn have
their own assumptions. For example, BIA equations are often com-
pared against air displacement plethysmography or hydrostatic
weighing. But both of these techniques require assumptions about
the density of the FFM. The density of the FFM depends on numer-
ous factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity [22]. Therefore any “gold
standards” that likewise depend on the two-compartment model (i.e.
FM and FFM) are themselves are only valid in the same population,
and most of those are also primarily tested on White (presumably
cis and binary gender) subjects.
Even techniques that do not depend on the two-compartment
model such as dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are found to signif-
icantly underestimate fat mass when compared with CT scans [42].
Ultimately, the only way to validate a body composition device is
using cadaver studies and chemical analysis, which have some of
the same issues - the results would then only be validated for those
similar to the cadavers [70]. Although measurement problems of
this type are common in all areas of science, the lack of physiologi-
cal basic science about how and why FFM varies with respect to
both social and biological factors in an intersectional way means
that it is difficult to determine which assumptions will hold across
populations. Because of this, the lack of population-specific testing
in each individual “gold standard” testing regime complicates the
possibility of meaningful validation for folks who do not fit the
default.
6.3 Why (anti-)Black Boxes? The Lack of
Regulatory Oversight
The gap between promises and reality in the smart medical device
space is in part due to the limited scope of review by the United
States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The vast majority
of medical devices, including “smart” and “connected” devices, are
approved through a program at the FDA known as the 510k ap-
proval process. This process requires no clinical trials and very little
oversight - device manufacturers merely need to prove that their
product is “substantially equivalent” to that of an already approved

law, as well as Ruha Benjamin’s critique of photographic film [5, 17].
medical device. The Withings scale discussed in this paper received
510(k) clearance [1]; similar scales on the market such as the Fitbit
Aria scale received approval even after the devices were already
on the market [2]. In 2014, the FDA announced their intentions
to cease requiring even 510(k) approval for devices such as smart
weight scales. This means that there is very little regulation of
these devices, and certainly no required clinical validation of the
algorithms used to calculate body composition, despite the label of
“clinically tested” on the Withings website.
This lack of regulatory oversight results in most consumer-
focused deployments of technologies like BIA being “black box”
algorithms. Popularized in the context of technology studies by
scholar Bruno Latour, an algorithm is considered a black box “when
a statement is simply presented as raw fact without any reference
to its genesis or even its author.” [34]. When using the Withings
scale, only the final body fat percentage is made available, and there
is no explicit reference to an algorithm in the app or in most of
the marketing materials. Additionally, Withings does not release
the equations its scales use to calculate FFM or the populations
that it used to calculate those equations. The power of the black
box is that we cannot thoroughly investigate a subject about which
nothing is known [60]. We are left with the assumption that, unless
proven otherwise, Withings’ internal algorithm production mirrors
the biases of the research at large, but again, it is impossible to
tell. All that we know are the inputs that Withings asks users for
(binary gender, height, age and athlete status).
We can draw some conclusions even with just publicly available
information. The binary approach to the gender question without
any explanatory text both erases nonbinary people, and does not ask
the right question about the embodiment of the user. The Withings
scale does not prompt the user to enter information related to
ethnicity, so it is not possible that the scale is using an equation
that adjusts variables to compensate for different FFM factors in
racial or ethnic groups. Because of the marketing of the technology,
non-White users may not even know that it might be relevant. The
Withings scale’s algorithm is, in the words of Ruha Benjamin, an
anti-Black box [5].
Furthermore, what evidence we do have points to BIA being unre-
liable even on the populations that it is theoretically well positioned
for. We reviewed the list of studies that Withings shared on their
page for researchers and found only one study that specifically eval-
uated the body composition aspects of the scales [14]. The results
of the study compared the performance of the newer Body Cardio
scales with an air displacement plethysmography device called the
Bod Pod (a “gold standard” discussed in Section 6.2). The mean
absolute percentage error of the body fat estimation of the Body
Cardio weight scale compared with the Bod Pod was greater than
25%, well above a previously established 1.5% threshold deemed
as an acceptable error [14].4 This suggests that any results from
the Withings scales should be interpreted with extreme caution,
even on the target population who is most well represented in the
studies likely used to create equations.
4It is important to note, however, that while air displacement plethysmography is
often used as a comparison device/gold standard, it relies on assumptions that can
compromise its effectiveness as we discuss in Section 4.1. Withings also argues that
these scales should be used to indicate trends rather than for absolute assessment [83].

7 DENYING SELF-KNOWLEDGE
Kendra: The distance between Withings’ promise of self-knowledge
and the reality of regression equations is upsetting. They advertise all
of these benefits to self-quantification, but it’s actually limited by the
technology [26]. As with many algorithmic technologies, the creation
of regression equations based on a limited sample cannot and will not
create accurate self-knowledge amongst those who do not fit within
those samples.
If the scale was actually individually calculating a ground truth
number, as opposed to using a regression based on height and skirt-
wearing vs. pants-wearing, being nonbinary wouldn’t matter! To be
honest, 90% of the time when I’m asked my gender or sex, it doesn’t
matter. It’s an arbitrary box checking exercise. So why would the
Withings scale be different?
There’s this sleight of hand involved in not revealing to people how
the technology works that creates the situation in which a nonbinary
person could go in expecting self-knowledge and getting a prediction
totally disconnected from what they themselves could tell you about
their body. I could have told the scale more about me to make the
answer more accurate, but that wasn’t an option. I don’t necessarily
mind sharing information about my hormone status, my sex assigned
at birth, or other facts about my body if they’re actually useful. And
although my views on volunteering race are shaped by my member-
ship in a privileged racial group, I suspect many users would prefer to
share race or ethnicity information if it meant that they would get
more accurate results.
Withings asks for my gender, but it doesn’t want it, even aside
from the app’s confusion between gender and sex. I know things about
myself that are relevant to its guessing, but there’s no way to translate
this knowledge within the limited frame of reference produced by
the clinical trials. There’s no way to come out with a more accurate
picture or contest the bounded understanding of the system. That feels
erasing, even more than the mere existence of the binary prompt.
It makes me wonder about all of the other random gender/sex
requests that I’ve encountered when using technologies around health.
Does Fitbit want my gender/sex for calorie burning calculation? Does
Apple? What about the Ring Fit? How deep does the rabbit hole go?
8 PATHS FORWARD AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Trans and nonbinary people of all races deserve to have access
to inclusive self-tracking technologies that do not collapse their
identities or force them to ignore relevant self-knowledge. What
can be done to improve these technologies? We evaluate three
options for how to handle sex/gender under the hood of a BIA-
calculating device such as the Withings scale, and then provide
overall recommendations as to how to handle the use of regression
equations based on limited medical testing.
It would be inappropriate to continue without noting that BIA
as a technology deployed in smart scales may be fundamentally
inseparable from the fatphobic medical and cultural context that
has created concerns about body fat in the first place [48]. Withings
may claim that “there is more to you than just weight” (see Figure
2), but the subtext of its advertising indicates that you should want
to weigh less. That is not fixable through recommendations around
the handling of sex (or gender, or hormone status). It might be rea-
sonably asked - given all its flaws, should BIA be used in consumer
devices at all? We don’t seek to answer that question in this paper.
Our aims are more modest. Nonbinary folk and transgender folks
deserve access to technologies of self-knowledge, even as those
technologies may be used both by companies and individuals to
suggest harmful body standards.
We provide a series of options for making weight scales based on
BIAmore inclusive, with recommendations for users, and both man-
ufacturers and researchers. Most of our recommendations specifi-
cally focus on sex/gender, but it is worth noting that overall, BIA
also has a long way to go when it comes to race/ethnicity, which
we leave for future work to explore in more depth. Although our
recommendations are designed based on the specific context of BIA
smart scales, they could potentially apply to many areas where
binary sex/gender is used as part of an algorithmic system.
Figure 2: A portion of the front page of theWithings website
advertising a version of their smart scale.
8.1 Option 1: Eliminate Sex/Gender as A
Variable
One option for making systems more inclusive of nonbinary people
would be the elimination of sex/gender as a variable, using one
equation for all users. Practically speaking, this is not difficult.
Manufacturers would not have to acquire new data, only re-run
the regression to find the best fit without sex/gender as a variable
in the regression equation(s).
However, a drawback of this option is that elimination of sex
/ gender as a variable for all users would result in readings that
348
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Kendra Albert and Maggie Delano
were less accurate in aggregate, as the inclusion of sex does reduce
the mean error of the regression equations [40]. Given the lack of
accuracy of the technology as a whole, this may or may not be
hugely significant - however, users who find a sex/gender binary
appropriate for their bodies might be upset to lose accuracy in order
to make the technology more inclusive.
8.2 Option 2: Add a Third Option
The next option is to add a third option to the menu where one
currently chooses sex/gender. One method of implementing a non-
binary option would be the optional elimination of sex/gender as a
variable as listed above for people who select a third option. There
would then be three options: “male,” “female,” and “sex/gender neu-
tral.”
This option could be helpful for some intersex people, nonbinary
people who have not medically transitioned but who would prefer
potentially less accurate results to having to volunteer a binary
marker, nonbinary people who have taken some medical transition
steps, and anyone else for whom the binary sex options are unlikely
to produce accurate results. A cautionary note: having a third option
in the menu does not a nonbinary inclusive app make. As Anna
Lauren Hoffman explains in her generative work on data violence
and inclusion, without taking meaningful steps to change the power
dynamics present in the product, inclusion is at best, lip service
[35]. For example, when Facebook allowed for self-identification
with a wider variety of gender identities on their platform, they did
not fundamentally change the binary advertising logic of male or
female, making their claims of nonbinary inclusion questionable
[8]. Thus, adding a third option is only appropriate if there is an
underlying algorithmic change.
8.3 Option 3: Stop Using Sex/Gender as a Proxy
Ultimately, the ideal outcome of this work would be for the field to
take a step back and consider the role that sex/gender are playing
as a “stand in” for things like body fat distribution and anthropo-
morphic information. This is exactly the kind of work that HCI
researchers have recommended when considering trans embodi-
ment [11, 53]. But it is more difficult in this case than many others
because of how pervasive assumptions about sex and gender are in
clinical research [54, 75, 79]. The full, complicated role that sex and
gender play in BIA equations and beyond are not well understood.
Significant fundamental research is necessary to begin to under-
stand which additional factors to measure and how to measure
them in cost-effective and reliable ways.
A deeper understanding of sex/gender and body composition
will require “slow science” [76]. With more information about the
role that these factors are playing, additional information could be
provided by end users - everything from body shape (i.e., “apple”,
“pear”) to hormone status. This information could even be made
optional to not place an additional burden on those unfamiliar
with the specifics or who want to do the basics. Fundamentally, this
approach is the most well aligned with the promises that companies
such as Withings make about their technologies, but would also
require the most fundamental research.
8.4 Recommendations
First, some advice to transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people
who wish to use technology that incorporates BIA but presents
binary sex options. Based on studies looking at changes in body
composition, hormone status is a very significant variable for body
composition of the bodily characteristics, perhaps more significant
than other variables that are encompassed by the word sex [21, 73].
So we would recommend that if folks must pick a binary category,
they pick the one most closely aligned with their hormonal balance -
male if in a normal male range for testosterone, female if not. In any
case, because of the study populations used to produce equations
and the black box nature of these algorithms, the actual value
produced is unlikely to be accurate and should be used primarily
to track change over time rather than for its absolute value. (This
recommendation also holds true for any person of any gender using
the scale.)
In Table 1, we lay out additional recommendations for researchers
and manufacturers who wish to build more inclusive regression-
based technologies. Elaboration on some of these recommendations
and additional recommendations for different contexts can be found
in the following references: [11, 28, 53, 54, 74, 75, 79].
In general our recommendations can be summarized as a) ac-
knowledge the existence of non-gender normative people, b) make
fewer assumptions, and c) explain in more detail the limitations
of technology. Of course, it may be difficult for companies to fully
be honest about measurement accuracy and precision. But if being
explicit and honest with customers about these errors and assump-
tions would make them think twice about purchasing a product,
perhaps the best next step is for companies to reconsider their
business model.
Of course, including trans people after the fact is not ideal. Par-
ticipatory methods that incorporate transgender people in problem
definition around medical devices - to design, in the words of Haim-
son et al., trans technologies - would be preferable to all of these
stopgap measures [15, 28, 32, 67]. However, as practitioners who
work with participatory methods, we understand that such prac-
tices are unlikely to arise overnight. Until it’s widely accepted that
designing for those on the margins can create better medical de-
vices, participatory design may never fully adopted by those who
commercialize them.
9 CONCLUSION
It can be easy to assume that the use of “sex” in quasi-medical
applications is neutral, just another fact about one’s body that
allows for a more accurate complete picture. But, in the immortal
words of dril, “this whole thing smacks of gender” [20]. When the
lived realities of nonbinary folks cause us to scratch below the
surface, the lack of careful thought around assumptions that go
into technologies like smart scales becomes clear. Cultural beliefs
about gender are driving the bus when it comes to engagement with
“sex differences.” And because of that, sex, even in clinically tested
BIA equations, is holding space for too many variables, supported
by too little basic research.
When inadequately validated, (anti)-Black box algorithms built
on these shaky foundations deceive their users. They harm people

BIA. Table design inspired by [54].
Context Marginalizing Practices Inclusive Practices
For manufacturers
and researchers
Assume sex is purely biological and gen-
der is purely social.
Review literature on sex/gender and select the appropriate measures for
the specific project. If none are available, consider conducting more basic
research, and consider and articulate the limitations of the state of the
art.
Assume a biosocial explanation for physiological differences unless evi-
dence clearly suggests otherwise.
Ignore the existence of trans, non-
binary, and intersex people.
Acknowledge the existence of trans, non-binary, and intersex people and
how their physiology or experiences might be different from other users.
Acknowledge, if needed, the limitations of the current results and how
trans and nonbinary people can still obtain the best results for them.
Analyze results only at the population
level.
Analyze results for sub-groups and at the individual level.
Evaluate results across racial and ethnic groups, implementing
race/ethnicity selection or inclusion of non-proxy variable as appro-
priate.
For manufacturers Elide the measurement precision and
assumptions.
Explicitly state the precision of the measurement system, along with
assumptions and constants used.
Represent sex and/or gender with pic-
tograms.
Use clear terminology based on the underlying research or known physi-
ology to select a term.
Be explicit why sex and/or gender are being used so that trans, non-binary
and/or intersex users can choose the best option for them.
For researchers Assume “gold standard” has no built-in
assumptions.
Discuss the assumptions embedded in the gold standard methods them-
selves, and how those assumptions influence the results.
Assume the collection of sex and/or gen-
der information is obvious or straight-
forward, and therefore does not need to
be discussed in depth.
Include whether reported sex and/or gender was based on self-report,
and if so, what options were available for participants to choose between.
Were there only two options? Was there a free response option?
Explicitly state how sex and gender are being used and what they stand
in for. Example: “sex is a stand-in for the dimorphic distribution of body
fat in the human population.”
who do not line up with the assumed user base, promising knowl-
edge of self but instead merely reproducing the violence of erasing
clinical systems [35].
It doesn’t have to be this way. Even without additional clinical
testing or regulation, there are clear steps that manufacturers can
take to mitigate some of the harms caused by these systems. First,
they can educate users as to the population-level accuracy ofmetrics
like BIA, rather than advertising body composition analysis as if
it was accurate on an individual basis. Second, as discussed above,
they can make clear how the technology does or does not work
on transgender or nonbinary people, while also identifying other
factors (such as race and/or ethnicity) that make results more or less
accurate. Finally, manufacturers could release as much information
about their equations as possible, including validation studies, in
order to facilitate cross-validation by independent researchers.
Admittedly, these solutions may reify technical expertise and
serve to legitimize the ideas of these types of body measurement,
350
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Kendra Albert and Maggie Delano
as Greene, Stark, and Hoffman, point out in their work on tech-
nological ethics [29]. Ultimately, BIA is just one example of how
regression-based body measurements, whether implemented in
technologies like smart scales or described in scientific papers,
harm those who are not presumed to be the ideal. And that whole
thing is worth overturning.
