ABSTRACT
Computer vision is widely deployed, has highly visible, society-
altering applications, and documented problems with bias and rep-
resentation. Datasets are critical for benchmarking progress in fair
computer vision, and often employ broad racial categories as popu-
lation groups for measuring group fairness. Similarly, diversity is
often measured in computer vision datasets by ascribing and count-
ing categorical race labels. However, racial categories are ill-defined,
unstable temporally and geographically, and have a problematic
history of scientific use. Although the racial categories used across
datasets are superficially similar, the complexity of human race
perception suggests the racial system encoded by one dataset may
be substantially inconsistent with another. Using the insight that
a classifier can learn the racial system encoded by a dataset, we
conduct an empirical study of computer vision datasets supplying
categorical race labels for face images to determine the cross-dataset
consistency and generalization of racial categories. We find that
each dataset encodes a substantially unique racial system, despite
nominally equivalent racial categories, and some racial categories
are systemically less consistent than others across datasets. We
find evidence that racial categories encode stereotypes, and exclude
ethnic groups from categories on the basis of nonconformity to
stereotypes. Representing a billion humans under one racial cat-
egory may obscure disparities and create new ones by encoding
stereotypes of racial systems. The difficulty of adequately convert-
ing the abstract concept of race into a tool for measuring fairness
underscores the need for a method more flexible and culturally
aware than racial categories.

1 INTRODUCTION
Datasets are a primary driver of progress in machine learning and
computer vision, and each dataset reflects human values. Many of
the most visible applications of computer vision require datasets
consisting of human faces: face recognition[12], kinship[40], demo-
graphic estimation [15], emotion recognition [50], and generative
modeling [26]. The datasets driving face-centric computer vision
often come with racial annotations of identity, expressed as a race
category assigned to each face. Racial categories are also prevalent
in the field of fair computer vision, which aims to increase the
conformity of computer vision systems to human notions and ideas
of fairness. However, little attention is given to the validity, con-
struction, or stability of these categories despite their contentious
origins and problematic history of scientific use.
Although these categories are given equivalent names across
datasets (e.g., Black, White, etc), how equivalent are they? If different
datasets have substantially different concepts of race, progress in
reducing bias against a group as measured on one dataset is unlikely
to transfer to another. Extreme agreement between the datasets
could be likewise troubling: race is an abstract, fuzzy notion, and
highly consistent representations of a racial group across datasets
could be indicative of stereotyping or reification of the physical
characteristics of race. Our work is the first to empirically study
category bias, consistency, and generalization in the context of
racial categories and fair computer vision. Specifically, we quantify
the degree to which fair computer vision datasets agree on what
a racial category consists of, who belongs to it, how strongly they
belong to it, and how consistent these categories are across datasets.
It is tempting to believe fairness can be purely mathematical
and independent of the categories used to construct groups, but
measuring the fairness of systems in practice, or understanding the
impact of computer vision in relation to the physical world, neces-
sarily requires references to groups which exist in the real world,
however loosely. Datasets attempt to encode these social groupings
- commonly racial categories - through an assignment of racial la-
bels to faces so that group fairness [48] can be measured. Group
fairness aims to equalize a metric such as accuracy across groups
defined by a protected characteristic, such as racial categories.
Our work is related in spirit to Hanna et.al, [18] as well as Ben-
thall andHaynes [5], who both critique the usage of racial categories
from the perspective of critical race theory. We draw on Scheurman
et.al’s [42] survey of identity classification schemes, definitions,
and annotation methods in computer vision. Our work is heavily
inspired by Torrallba and Efros [47], who similarly use an ensemble
of classifiers to empirically study category bias and generalization

in the context of general object detection and image classification
datasets.
We identify the emergence of a standard racial classification
scheme, and use four fair computer vision datasets which imple-
ment the scheme to study the consistency of the racial categories
and the bias of fair computer vision datasets. We hand-collect an
additional, small scale dataset to study how ethnic groups fit into
the stereotypes of racial categories encoded into datasets. Our con-
tributions can be summarized as follows:
(1) We develop a method to empirically study the generalization
and consistency of racial categories across datasets.
(2) We quantify the generalization and consistency of the racial
systems encoded in four commonly used fair CV datasets.
(3) We study how strongly each racial category is represented
by a stereotypical presentation unique to each dataset, and
who those stereotypes include and exclude.
(4) We determine the degree to which the racial systems in fair
computer vision datasets are self-consistent.
(5) We investigate how strongly individuals in biometric datasets
are ascribed a racial category, and find systematic differences.
Every facial image dataset that uses racial categories encodes
a racial system - a set of rules and heuristics for assigning racial
categories based on facial features. We use a classifier trained on the
faces and racial labels in a dataset as an approximation of the racial
system of the dataset. By training a classifier for each dataset, we ob-
tain an ensemble of classifiers, each of which has learned the racial
system of the dataset it was trained on. By asking each classifier in
the ensemble to predict a racial category for the same face, the racial
systems of each dataset can be directly interrogated and compared.
We use such an ensemble as the basis for our experiments.
The results are intriguing, and we argue that they show racial
categories may simply be unreliable as indicators of identity. We
find that some racial categories are much more consistently defined
than others, and datasets seem to systematically encode stereotypes
of racial categories. Our work also opens up concerns about the
ability of these racial categories to represent the diversity of human
faces.We show that some ethnic groups are excluded from the racial
category that they "should" belong to given the straightforward
interpretation of those racial categories. We critique and highlight
further problems with racial categories in the context of cross-
cultural validity and impact on ethnic minorities.
2 RELATED LITERATURE
2.1 Critical Appraisals of Race in ML
Historically, the computer vision community has not engaged with
critical perspectives on race, typically treating racial categories
as commonsense concepts. Benthall and Haynes [5] highlight the
instability of racial categories and argue that racial categories have
been historically used for stigmatizing individuals, and using racial
categories for fairness risks reifying those racial categories and
reproducing inequity. In [18], Hanna, et.al call attention to the
multidimensionality of race and the need to critically assess and
justify the choice of racial categories and schemes. Monea [33]
catalogues racially problematic incidents in computer vision history
and highlights the hypervisbility and reliance on skin color in racial
classification schemes.
2.2 Dataset Audits
The literature on dataset bias reveals problems endemic to machine
learning as a whole, which are only magnified by the complexities
of racial identity. Our approach and exposition is heavily inspired
by [47], who used an ensemble of classifiers to study dataset bias
and cross-dataset generalization in commonly used datasets for
object detection and classification, noting substantial differences in
the representation of nominally similar categories across datasets.
We draw on the survey of computer vision datasets in [42], who
enumerate the diverse and ill-defined array of racial classification
schemes and definitions in computer vision datasets. Geiger et.al
[16] find significant variability in the quality of human annotations
in a case study of papers on tweet classification.
2.3 Racial Classification, Ancestry, Genetics
Recent advances in population genetics have allowed researchers
to interrogate the validity of race from the perspective of genetics
and ethnicity. The science of ancient DNA has shown that most
modern day human populations are relatively recent mixtures of
588
One Label, One Billion Faces: Usage and Consistency of Racial Categories in Computer Vision FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
more ancient populations [30] who do not fit into modern day
racial categories. In addition, contemporary human populations
have been shaped by repeated admixture events [21] resulting in
large-scale gene flow between populations widely separated by
geography. Although there are geographically structured difference
in genes and correlations between traditional concepts of race and
geography, there is substantial genetic overlap between traditional
racial groups [25], invalidating the treatment of races as discrete,
disjoint groups.
2.4 Soft Biometrics
The field of soft biometrics encompasses notions of identity and
traits which are not unique to an individual, but carry information
meaningful to society for identification. Canonical examples of soft
biometrics are kinship [40], age [8], gender [53], and demographic
information [15]. The line of work most relevant to our work is
coarse-grained demographic estimation, which aims to predict a
broad racial category for a face. One of the primary challenges in
soft biometrics is that observed traits may not reflect the ground
truth of identity: for example, a person can look much younger than
they are, or two individuals may look like sisters due to similarity
in appearance.
2.5 Cognitive & Social Perspectives
Despite the treatment of race as a commonsense, natural kind, re-
search has shown that specialized race perception is unlikely to be
an evolved trait or a byproduct of reasoning about natural kinds
[10]. Edgar et.al [13] demonstrate that race estimations in medical
records are less consistent for some racial categories than others.
Pirtle and Brown [29] draw attention to the mental health conse-
quences of inconsistent racial identification on individuals, and
pinpoint Hispanic and Indigenous Americans as two groups who
are often perceived inconsistently relative to African and European
Americans.
2.6 Algorithmic Fairness & Datasets
Group fairness [48] is one of the most easily understood formal
notions of fairness, and maps neatly to legal notions of fairness by
aiming to equalize a metric across groups, which are often defined
by protected characteristics such as race. A vibrant ecosystem of
datasets has sprung up to support evaluations of group fairness.
Some of most prominent of these are datasets which supply cat-
egorical race labels, such as FairFace [28], BFW [41], RFW [49],
and LAOFIW [2] using compatible racial categories. Other datasets,
such as PPB [7] and Diversity in Faces [32], use phenotype anno-
tations in lieu of racial categories. Audits of algorithms, APIs, and
software [39],[17],[27] have found statistically significant dispari-
ties in performance across groups and have been critical to bringing
racial disparities to light.
3 RACIAL CATEGORIES
3.1 Usage in Fair Computer Vision
Racial categories are used without being defined or only loosely
and nebulously defined [42] - researchers either take the existence
and definitions of racial categories as a given that does not have
to be justified, or adopt a "I know it when I see it" approach to
racial categories. Given that the categories are allusions to both
geographic origin and physical characteristics, it is understandable
that deeper discussion of these categories is avoided because it veers
into unpleasant territory. This leads to myriad systems of racial
classifications and terminology - some of debatable coherence, such
as grouping together "people with ancestral origins in Sub-Saharan
Africa, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, among others" [34], and others
which could be considered offensive, such as "Mongoloid".
Racial categories are used to define groups of interest in fair
machine learning because these categories are believed to reflect
social groups in the real world. While Benthall and Haynes [5]
highlight issues with the usage of racial categories themselves -
recommending their replacement - Hanna et.al [18] argue that
racial categories cannot be ignored, as individuals are affected by
the racial category others believe them to be.
The construction of large-scale, fair computer vision datasets
typically involves collecting a large number of face images, either
from an established dataset or web scraping, and then ascribing
a racial category to each of the collected faces. Scheurman et.al.,
[42] detail the myriad racial categories and classification schemes
used in computer vision, but we identify and focus on a commonly
used set of racial categories: East Asian, South Asian, White, and
Black. Occasionally, these categories are referred to by different
names - (e.g., Indian instead of South Asian). These categories are
partially based on US Census categories and visual distinctness of
the categories [28] and believed to "encompass enough of the global
population to be useful" [15].
Crucially, the annotation processes for computer vision datasets
largely involve a "moment of identification" by the annotators [42],
in which the annotators ascribe a racial label onto an individual
based on their physical characteristics. This is different from data
collection regimes in other domains, where racial labels may be
provided by individuals themselves. However, the annotation of
observed race in computer vision datasets provides a unique oppor-
tunity to study the social construction of race and race perception.
3.2 Specific Problems with Racial Categories
We identify four specific problems with the usage of racial cate-
gories. First, racial categories are ill-defined, arbitrary and implicitly
tied loosely to geographic origin. Second, given that racial cate-
gories are implicitly references to geographic origin, their extremely
broad, continent-spanning construction would result in individuals
with drastically different appearances and ethnic identities being
grouped incongruously into the same racial category if the racial
categories were interpreted literally. Thus racial categories must be
understood both as references to geographic origin as well as phys-
ical characteristics. Third, racial categories conspicuously erase
differences between ethnic groups and group billions of people into
one category. Fourth, a system of identity in which a face is assigned
a singular racial category is incapable of expressing a substantial
proportion of human diversity and variation.
3.2.1 Racial Categories Are Badly Defined. The Indian/South Asian
category presents an excellent example of the pitfalls of racial
categories. If the Indian category refers only to the country of
India, it is obviously arbitrary - the borders of India represent the
589
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Zaid Khan and Yun Fu
partitioning of a colonial empire on political grounds. Therefore, it
is reasonable to take the Indian category as representing the entirety
of the Indian subcontinent, or South Asia. This presents another
set of problems, as expanding the region we consider the "home" of
a racial category also expands our borders, and introduces another,
larger set of shared borders along which populations should be
visually indistinguishable due to proximity, admixture, and shared
culture.
3.2.2 Naive Interpretations of Racial Categories Are Incongruous.
Because racial categories are defined with respect to, and largely
correspond with geographic regions, they include populations with
a wide range of phenotypical variation, from those most steretotyp-
ical of a racial category to racially ambiguous individuals or those
who may appear to be of a different observed race altogether. As
an example, the South Asian racial category should include popu-
lations in Northeast India, who may exhibit traits which are more
common in East Asia. However, including individuals which ap-
pear East Asian in a racial category distinct from East Asian would
violate the common, lay understanding of racial categories.
3.2.3 Racial Categories Erase Ethnic Differences and Identity. Racial
categories are continent-spanning groupings. Every racial category
subsumes hundreds of ethnic groups with distinct languages, cul-
tures, separation in space and time, and phenotypes. Ethnic groups
even span racial lines [35] and racial categories can fractionalize
ethnic groups, placing some members in one racial category, and
others in a different category. Evaluations of fairness which only
use racial categories cannot quantify bias against individual ethnic
groups, and ascribing a privileged identity to a member of an un-
derprivileged group could result in individual harm by algorithmic
intervention.
3.2.4 Racial Categories Aren’t Expressive Enough. The often em-
ployed, standard set of racial categories (Asian, Black, White, South
Asian) which we study in this paper is, at a glance, incapable of
representing a substantial number of humans. It obviously excludes
indigenous peoples of the Americas, and it is unclear where the
hundreds of millions of people who live in the Near East, Middle
East, or North Africa should be placed. One can consider extending
the number of racial categories used, but racial categories will al-
ways be incapable of expressing multiracial individuals, or racially
ambiguous individuals. National origin or ethnic origin can be uti-
lized, but the borders of countries are often the results of historical
circumstance and don’t reflect differences in appearance, and many
countries are not racially homogeneous.
3.3 Reasons to Expect Inconsistency
The four datasets we consider all have racial categories which are
nominally equivalent: East Asian, South Asian, White, and Black.
We chose to exclude datasets from our analysis that use obviously
different racial categories , such as DemogPairs [24]. We expect
to find inconsistency between these nominally equivalent racial
categories for several reasons. First, despite the commonsense belief
in racial categories, there are differences in how individuals perceive
race. Second, the huge population size of racial categories means
that samples in datasets drawn from the racial categories may
represent drastically different faces due to the difference between
sample size and population size.
3.3.1 Inconsistent Human Race Perception. The self-identification
of humans affects [14] [38] how they classify the race of others. In
addition, human observers are notably less congruent when iden-
tifying [22][29] faces from non-White or non-Black backgrounds.
Telles [46] found that observers were more consistent when as-
sessing the race of lighter-skinned individuals than darker skinned
individuals. Taken together, these facts paint a picture of a hu-
man annotator whose racial system for assigning race to a face
depends substantially on the background of the annotator and is
more variable for individuals with some characteristics than others.
3.3.2 Large, Heterogeneous Populations. Even if all annotators had
the same set of rules for mapping facial traits to racial categories,
each dataset must represent racial categories consisting of several
billion people with tens of thousands of faces. The small size of
these samples relative to the heterogeneity, diversity, and size of
populations being sampled implies that each dataset may contain
faces drawn from parts of the population which were not sampled
in other race datasets. Thus, even in the unlikely case that annota-
tors subscribe to the same racial system, nominally similar racial
categories may contain different faces.
4 EXPERIMENTS
Our approach is based heavily on Torralba and Efros [47], who use
an ensemble of classifiers to study dataset bias by testing how well
nominally equivalent categories generalize from one dataset to the
next. We broadly follow Torralba and Efros’s approach, though we
focus on consistency between classifiers as well as accuracy against
the "true" labels of a dataset. The key insight of this approach
is that a sufficiently powerful classifier trained on a dataset will
capture the heuristics and rules used by the dataset creators or
annotators to assign a class to an image, and these classifiers can
then be compared to quantify the degree of difference between the
classification systems in a dataset.
In the first experiment, we train the ensemble of classifiers and
measure cross dataset generalization. In the second experiment,
we split each dataset into 3 equal-sized, disjoint subsets and train
a new classifier on each disjoint part to gain insight into the self-
consistency of each dataset and the effect of dataset size on the
ability to represent a racial category. In the third experiment, we
use the predictions from the classifier ensemble to investigate how
strongly individuals with multiple pictures are associated to a racial
category In the fourth we study category bias in datasets from a
different perspective by using a dataset of ethnic groups to examine
stereotypes learnt by the ensemble of classifiers.
4.1 Preliminaries
4.1.1 Datasets. We use four fair computer vision datasets: FairFace
[28], BFW [41], RFW [49], and LAOFIW [2]. These datasets were
chosen for several reasons. First, they encode nominally equivalent
categories: White, Black, East Asian, and South Asian. Second,
FairFace, BFW, and RFW are all built from widely used, large-scale
computer vision datasets. FairFace is built from YFCC-100M, BFW
is built from VGG2, and RFW from MSCeleb-1M. All four of the

datasets have impacted the field of fair ML, either by their use as
benchmarks, or by revealing new inequalities between populations.
BFW and RFW are deep - they have multiple photos per individual,
while FairFace and LAOFIW have only one photo per individual,
except for incidental duplicates.
Other datasets, such as DivFace [34] or DemogPairs [24], use
custom, nominally incompatible racial categories and/or mix mul-
tiple source datasets. Datasets like 10K US Adult Faces [4] have
not been explicitly targeted towards the fair computer vision com-
munity and contain image modifications which make them easily
distinguishable. Finally, all of the selected datasets are large enough
to support the training of a modern CNN for classification. This
is not the case for some older datasets, which contain only a few
hundred images.
4.1.2 Classifier Ensemble. Our key insight is that an image-based
classifier, if trained on the racial categories in a dataset, can learn the
system of rules the annotators of the dataset used to assign a racial
category to a face. By training multiplier classifiers - one for each
dataset - we obtain an ensemble of classifiers, each having learned
the racial system encoded by their source dataset. By comparing
the predictions of these classifiers, we can quantify how different
the racial system in each dataset is. We use a 50-layer ResNet[19], a
commonly used backbone for deep vision tasks, as our base classifier.
The ResNets use pretrained weights from ImageNet[11], and are
implemented in PyTorch [37]. To set the learning rate, we use the
one-cycle policy [43] using the implementation in [23].
4.1.3 Preprocessing. Tomitigate spurious differences between datasets,
we performed a standard preprocessing in face recognition [31] by
aligning the faces in each dataset using the keypoints detected by an
MTCCN [52] so the left eye lies at (0.35 ×𝑤, 0.35 ×ℎ), while simul-
taneously rotating and rescaling the image to (𝑤 = 256, ℎ = 256) so
that the eyes are level and the distance between the eyes is the same
in all images, thus ensuring all images have the same dimensions,
and contain faces of the same scale. FairFace separates the "Asian"
category into "East Asian" and "Southeast Asian" - we combine this
into one category.
4.1.4 Metrics. To measure cross-dataset generalization, we use
the standard notion of accuracy. To measure the consistency of
predictions made by multiple classifiers, we use the Fleiss-^ score,
a standard measure of inter-annotator agreement [3] applicable
to multiple annotators. Conceptually, the Fleiss-^ score is amount
of agreement between the annotators beyond that expected by
chance. Interpretation of the Fleiss-^ score can be difficult in abso-
lute terms, so we typically restrict ourselves to comparing Fleiss-^
scores relative to one another.
4.2 Cross-Dataset Generalization
4.2.1 Setup. To understand how well the racial categories from
one dataset generalize to another, we construct an ensemble of
classifiers, C = {𝐶𝐵𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑟𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑒 ,𝐶𝑅𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐿𝐴𝑂𝐹𝐼𝑊 }. Each classi-
fier is trained on a different source dataset, and all datasets use a
common set of a racial categories:R = {Black,white, asian, indian},
and each face in the dataset comes annotated with a racial category
from R. Each classifier is trained to predict a racial category 𝑟 ∈ R,
given a face. The training set is constructed for each classifier by
using 80% of the faces in the source dataset of the classifier, and
using the remaining 20% as a validation set. As a concrete example,
the 𝐶𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑟𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑒 classifier would be trained using 80% of the faces in
FairFace, thus learning the heuristics used by the dataset creators
to assign a racial category to a face.
The classifiers were trained with the standard categorical cross-
entropy loss. Due to the usage of pretrained weights and a one-
cycle learning rate policy [43], only a small number of iterations
were sufficient for model convergence: 40 iterations for RFW and
FairFace, and 25 for LAOFIW and BFW.
4.2.2 Results. The results are reported in Table 1 as accuracy scores.
All classifiers displayed similar generalization performance, sug-
gesting that there is significant overlap and a core set of rules for
assigning racial categories to a face that is shared among all datasets.
Notably, final accuracy reached by each classifier on the validation
set varies significantly, but the absolute difference between the
generalization performance of different datasets is small. In some
sense, the easiest racial rulesets were encoded by BFW and RFW,
as the BFW and RFW classifiers showed the highest performance
on their validation sets. This could be due to the fact that BFW and
RFW contain multiple images per identity.
4.2.3 Label Noise and Learning. We note that looking only at the
accuracy of each classifier to conclude it has insufficiently learned
the rules used by the annotators of the dataset is misleading. The
classifier only has the cropped faces available, and cannot use con-
textual information used by the annotator to make racial decisions.
For example, research has shown that humans use cues like ed-
ucation level to make determinations of race [46], which can be
inferred from clothing or image context. In the context of the clas-
sification problem faced by the model, these phenomena can be
interpreted as label noise, and deep learning models are incredibly
robust to noisy labels [51] and can learn meaningful rules even in
591
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Zaid Khan and Yun Fu
the presence of high label noise. Furthermore, it is possible that
each dataset contains inconsistencies within itself. To give a con-
crete example, the annotators may have assigned a racial label to
a face, and then assigned a different racial label to an extremely
similar face due to contextual information or human error. We turn
next to an investigation of the self-consistency of each dataset.
4.3 Self-Consistency
The drop in cross-dataset generalization of racial categories can be
explained by three reasons. First, different annotators may have
conflicting racial systems - they have assigned different racial labels
to similar faces, the classifiers have learnt that, and so the classifiers
disagree. Second, the rules for assigning race to a face may not be
covered by the training data of the classifier. In other words, the
face is out of distribution [20], and the classifier has never seen
a similar face. This is very likely to happen in the case of BFW,
which contains only 800 different identities. Third, the rules for
assigning racial categories to a face might simply be inconsistent or
unlearnable, in which case the classifier would just be memorizing.
The reasonably high generalization performance of each classifier
indicates this is unlikely to be the case.We conduct an experiment to
provide insight into whether racial systems encoded by the datasets
are significantly different and conflicting, or whether the source of
the conflict is differences in the data distributions of each dataset.
4.3.1 Conflicting Racial Systems or Data Distributions? A face
may be perceived as Asian by one person, but Indian by another.
This would correspond to classifiers making conflicting predictions
about an individuals race because the underlying datasets define
race differently for that individual. In the second scenario, the indi-
vidual the classifiers are asked to classify is not similar to any face
present in the classifiers’ training datasets. This is possible because
the datasets are sampling from populations consisting of billions
of individuals, but are limited to a sample size multiple orders of
magnitudes smaller than the population. As a result, it is possible
that the classifiers only disagree because the underlying datasets do
not contain any faces similar to the face being considered.
4.3.2 Setup. To gain insight into whether we are seeing conflict-
ing racial systems or the result of dataset size and facial distribu-
tion differences, we devise the following experiment. We create
a self-ensemble for each dataset by splitting each dataset into 3
disjoint subsets, and training a classifier on each subset. BFW and
RFW, contain multiple images per person and are split so that
no person appears in multiple splits. Training protocols remain
the same. We then evaluate the consistency of each self-ensemble
against the ensemble of classifiers trained on the whole datasets
C = {𝐶𝐵𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑟𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑒 ,𝐶𝑅𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐿𝐴𝑂𝐹𝐼𝑊 }.
To evaluate the consistency of each self-ensemble, we predict a
race label for each face in a target dataset using the self-ensemble.
Because each self-ensemble contains 3 classifiers, each trained on a
different subset of the source dataset, this results in 3 predictions for
every face in the target dataset. We can then obtain the consistency
of the self-ensemble predictions using the Fleiss-^ score measuring
inter-annotator agreement. A similar procedure is followed for the
mixed ensemble C trained on the whole datasets.
4.3.3 Results. The results can be seen in Table 2. With the excep-
tion of LAOFIW, the predictions of each self-ensemble are more con-
sistent than the predictions of the mixed/whole ensemble C trained
on the whole datasets in Section 4.2. Despite a significant drop in
the training set size (-66%), the consistency of the self-ensembles on
average is higher than the consistency of the mixed/whole ensem-
bles. We interpret this as evidence that arbitrary subsets of each
dataset (except LAOFIW), even if much smaller than the whole
dataset, are large enough to encode generally consistent rules for
assigning racial categories to faces, and suggests that we are seeing
conflicts in rules for assigning racial labels to a face rather than
disagreements caused by out of distribution problems.
4.4 Distribution of Racial Disagreements
The cross-dataset generalization and self-consistency experiments
have shown that racial systems of datasets are self-consistent and in-
consistency is caused by conflicting racial systems between datasets.
However, the distribution of inconsistency is still unclear. Are some
racial categories less consistent and stable across datasets than oth-
ers, and if so, is the source of the inconsistency largely random
variations, or it systematic? We can analyze this question using
biometric datasets like BFW and RFW, which contain multiple pic-
tures per individual. If inconsistency is random, we expect to see
a large number of individuals who each have a small number of
photos in which the classifier ensemble C disagrees about their
race. If inconsistency is systematic, we expect to see a a substantial
number of individuals who have a large number of photos in which
the classifier ensemble C disagrees about their race.
4.4.1 Setup. We use the BFW and RFW datasets, along with the
classifier ensemble C = {𝐶𝐵𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑟𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑒 ,𝐶𝑅𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐿𝐴𝑂𝐹𝐼𝑊 }. We
obtain a racial category prediction for each face in BFW and RFW.
This results in 4 predictions for each image, as there are four classi-
fiers in the classifier ensemble. We then calculate the label homo-
geneity of each individual, which is the fraction of predictions in
which the most frequently predicted racial category is present. For
example, an individual with 25 photos would receive a total of 100
predictions, 4 for each image. If the most frequently predicted label
was white, and white was predicted 90 times, the label homogene-
ity would be 90
100 = 0.9. Simply put, label homogeneity is another
number to describe how strongly the classifiers saw an individual
as belonging to a racial category.
4.4.2 Results. All racial categories, across both BFW and RFW had
a substantial number of individuals with very high label homo-
geneity, meaning the classifier ensemble strongly identified them
with the racial category the annotators labeled them as (Figure 2).
All racial categories also had a substantial number of individuals
with low label homogeneity, indicating the classifiers systemati-
cally disagreed on the race of the individual, and disagreements are
not random. Label homogeneity was much higher for individuals
labeled Black than individuals labeled White or South Asian. This
is surprising, as there is no a priori reason to expect that identi-
fication of a Black individual is easier than that of another racial
category. We suspect that datasets either define Blackness very
strictly, or have a narrow concept of being Black that is consistent
across datasets.

4.5 Consistency of Racial Categories
To understand which racial categories are most stable and least
stable across datasets, we measure the consistency of the classifier
ensemble C = {𝐶𝐵𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑟𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑒 ,𝐶𝑅𝐹𝑊 ,𝐶𝐿𝐴𝑂𝐹𝐼𝑊 } per racial cat-
egory for each dataset. We use the Fleiss-^ score as the metric of
consistency.
4.5.1 Results. Themost stable and consistent category across datasets
was Black as seen in Table 3. The least stable was White, followed
closely by South Asian. In general, the Asian and Black categories
were much more stable than the South Asian and White categories
by a substantial margin. The faces in the Black category of RFW
were the most consistently percieved with a Fleiss-^ = 0.9. The
faces in the Asian category of BFW were second most consistently
percieved, with a Fleiss-^ = 0.81. The faces in the White category
of FairFace were the least consistently percieved, with a Fleiss-
^ = 0.44, much lower than any other category in any dataset.
4.6 Ethnicity and Stereotypes
The previous experiments paint a picture in which some racial
categories are much more consistent across datasets than others.
593
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Zaid Khan and Yun Fu
All the racial categories are equally ill-defined, so it is surprising
that in practice, datasets are very consistent about who goes in the
Black category or the Asian category relative to their inconsistency
about the South Asian and White categories. We hypothesize that
datasets simply include a more diverse set ofWhite and South Asian
faces, compared to their limited conception of Asian and Black faces.
To investigate this idea, we collect a dataset of ethnic groups. For
each geographic region tied to a racial category, we select two
ethnic groups originating from that geographic region, taking care
to select groups which are significantly separated from each other
by geography in the hope that this will maximize differences in
phenotypic traits.
4.6.1 Dataset. We obtain all images from the web by hand to en-
sure quality. We draw on three sources for images: lists of pub-
lic figures such as sportspeople and politicians, pictures taken at
ethnicity-specific festivals, and images taken by travel photogra-
phers in which ethnicity of the subjects is explicitly noted and
geolocation data matches the targeted region. We download the
images, detect, crop, align, and resize the faces following in the
procedure in 4.1.1. The ethnicities collected, and the number of
images collected, are summarized in Table 4.
4.6.2 Setup. Following the procedure in 4.5, we use the classifier
ensemble C trained in 4.2, to predict a racial category for every face
in every ethnic group. We then obtain Fleiss-^ scores for the ensem-
ble predictions for each ethnic group. This is the same procedure
as 4.5, except we group by ethnicity instead of racial category. We
also count the most frequently predicted racial category for each
ethnic group, which we summarize in Fig. 4.6.3.
4.6.3 Results. The most consistently perceived ethnic groups are
Iceland and Korean, on which the classifier ensemble C agreed
almost perfectly. The least consistently perceived ethnic group was
Balochi, with a Fleiss-^ score much lower than the others. The
results fit into a clear pattern, visible in Fig. 4.6.3. The classifier
ensemble agrees on the racial categorization of some ethnic groups
very strongly, on others, it disagrees very strongly. We interpret the
appearance of such an effect along ethnic lines to be evidence that
racial categories in dataset are partly based on racial stereotypes,
and the high level of consistency shown by the classifier ensemble
C on the Black and Asian category is partly a result of all tested
datasets containing images for those categories which conform
to a common stereotype. The Black racial category is the most
consistent across all datasets, with a Fleiss-^ = 0.78. However, we
argue that this is not because it is easier to identify individuals who
are Black, but because datasets contain a narrow conception of who
is Black and lack sufficient ethnic diversity. When presented with a
ethnic group who is likely not racialized adequately due to lack of
representation in datasets (Ethiopian), but originates from Africa
and could be considered Black by based on geographic origin, the
classifier ensemble is very inconsistent.
5 DISCUSSION
Our goal was to understand how each dataset constructs racial
categories by assigning racial labels to faces, how consistent and
similar the constructed categories are across datasets, and the beliefs

they encode about who belongs to a racial category, and how clearly
they belong to a racial category.
5.1 Experimental Results
The training of the classifier ensemble C was uneventful. The most
surprising conclusion is perhaps that no dataset clearly outper-
formed the others in its ability to encode racial categories that
generalize to others. Another interesting result is that the number
of identities, or unique individuals, in a dataset is much more im-
portant for encoding generalizable racial categories than the sheer
number of images.
We then moved onto measuring the self-consistency of the racial
assignments in each dataset. Intuitively, one would expect the
datasets to be self consistent if a classifier is able to learn gen-
eralizable concepts from the dataset. Seen in this light, the result
that the datasets are self-consistent is not surprising. However, it
is interesting that despite severely reducing the amount of faces
and identities available to each member of a self-ensemble due to
splitting the dataset, each self-ensemble members manages to learn
concepts of race that are substantially more similar to its cohorts
in the self-ensemble than to the concepts of race learned by classi-
fiers trained on other datasets. This strongly suggests that the rules
annotators use to assign a racial category to a face are relatively
simple, and subsequently brittle when it comes to novel faces like
ethnicities unrepresented in the training set.
594
One Label, One Billion Faces: Usage and Consistency of Racial Categories in Computer Vision FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
After self-consistency was established, we undertook a closer
examination of whether inconsistency in racial identification is
systematic, or largely due to random variations. If inconsistency in
racial identification was largely due to random variations, many of
our findings would be uninteresting. However, we found that every
racial category contained members who were strongly identified
as belonging to that category - they had very few or no images
on which the classifiers disagreed about the race of the individ-
ual - and we found that every racial category contained members
on which the classifiers strongly disagreed by making conflicting
racial assignments to their pictures. This result is particularly im-
portant: it shows that individuals, represented in BFW and RFW
by a set of pictures depicting the individual, are systematically the
subject of racial disagreements. In the alternative case, individuals
pictures would be the subjects of racial disagreements, with the
disagreed-upon and agreed-upon images uniformly spread across
individuals. Another interesting consequence of this experiment
is that classifiers showed relatively high agreement on individu-
als labeled as Black, compared to the high levels of disagreement
seen for individuals labeled as South Asian or White. There is no
intrinsic reason why this should be so, and our hypothesis is that
all datasets include and recognize a very specific type of person
as Black - a stereotype - while having more expansive and less
consistent definitions for other racial categories.
To gain more insight into how ethnicity and stereotypes inter-
play in forming racial categories, we conduct our final experiment,
which involves testing our classifier ensemble on the faces of mem-
bers belonging to specifically chosen ethnic groups. The results
are particularly illuminating. Despite the small size, we observed
a large difference in the consistency of racial perception across
ethnic groups. It is possible to explain some of the results purely
probabilistically - blonde hair is relatively uncommon outside of
Northern Europe, so blond hair is a strong signal of being from
Northern Europe, and thus, belonging to the White category. The
others are more difficult to explain. It is not so obvious why the
Filipino sample is not consistently seen as Asian while the Korean
sample is. The Ethiopian sample vs the Gambian sample is perhaps
the most interesting, and can explain some of the other results we
have seen. Ethiopia is in East Africa, and most of the African dias-
pora in the United States consist of individuals fromWest or Central
Africa [6]. If the datasets are biased towards images collected from
individuals in the United States, then East Africans may not be
included in the datasets, which results in high disagreement on the
racial label to assign to Ethiopians relative to the low disagreement
on the Black racial category in general.
5.2 A Clear and Present Danger
Racial categories and systems are localized in space and time. The
meaning of White has shifted over time [45] in the United States.
An individual who is Black in the United States may not be Black in
Brazil [46]. A racial system that "makes sense" in the United States
may not in other parts of the world. It may not "make sense" a few
years into the future. However, algorithms and datasets have the
power to shape society and social processes, just as they are shaped
by society. Already, demographic estimation algorithms using racial
categories are being deployed for advertising [36]. Advertising has
the power to shape preferences, desires, and dreams - and it is easy
to envision a future in which people are algorithmically offered
different dreams and products based on their race. Minorities in the
United States are already the target of harmful advertising [9], and
the potential for discrimination in online advertising [44] has been
noted.
Racial categories and systems are fundamentally created by hu-
mans, and embedded in a cultural context. The encoding of racial
categories in datasets, which are then used to train and evaluate al-
gorithms, removes the racial categories from their cultural context,
and turns them into concrete, reified categories. Datasets commonly
build on other datasets (all but one of the datasets studied in this
work do so), and so potentially reproduce and amplify the biases
of their predecessors. Divorced from their relativity and cultural
context, packaged into neat, concrete disjoint sets, racial categories
take on an independent, real existence. Privileged, wealthy, indus-
trialized countries in which most AI research is conducted have the
benefit of being the primary producers of datasets, and package
their racial systems into datasets. Effectively, this is a potentially
dangerous form of cultural export, and eventually, the exported
racial systems will take on a validity outside of their cultural con-
text, with potentially dangerous consequences.
Our experiments with ethnic stereotypes illustrate and under-
score the fact that racial categories are not a homogenous mass.
Having demographic equality in the form of racial categories in a
dataset does not mean a dataset is diverse, because not all White,
Indian, Black, or Asian people are the same. A dataset can have
equal amounts of individuals across racial categories, but exclude
ethnicities or individuals who don’t fit into stereotypes. The rise
of generative models and the controversies that have followed as
a lack of diversity [1] present another example of this effect. An
image superresolution model, when provided low resolution pic-
tures of minorities as input, sometimes turned them into White
faces. This was due to imbalances in the underlying training set:
it contained mostly White faces. However, "fixing" datasets by de-
mographic balancing misses subtleties. Suppose the underlying
dataset was demographically balanced with respect to racial cate-
gories in the way computer vision datasets are, and we provided it
a low resolution picture of an Ethiopian or a Baloch. It may erase
their ethnic identity but could produce an image belonging to the
"correct" racial category as output. This may be a dubious fix.
6 CONCLUSION
We empirically study the representation of race through racial
categories in fair computer vision datasets, and analyze the cross-
dataset generalization of these racial categories, as well as their
cross-dataset consistency, stereotyping, and self-consistency. We
find that some categories are more consistently represented than
others, but all racial categories transfer across dataset boundaries.
Furthermore, we find evidence that racial categories rely on stereo-
types and exclude ethnicities or individuals who do not fit into those
stereotypes. We find systematic differences in how strongly individ-
uals in biometric datasets are ascribed a racial category. We point
out the dangers and pitfalls of using racial categories in relation to
diversity and fairness.
