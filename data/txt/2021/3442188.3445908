ABSTRACT
The use of cash bail as a mechanism for detaining defendants pre-
trial is an often-criticized system that many have argued violates the
presumption of “innocent until proven guilty.” Many studies have
sought to understand both the long-term effects of cash bail’s use
and the disparate rate of cash bail assignments along demographic
lines (race, gender, etc). However, such work is often susceptible
to problems of infra-marginality – that the data we observe can
only describe average outcomes, and not the outcomes associated
with the marginal decision. In this work, we address this problem
by creating a hierarchical Bayesian model of cash bail assignments.
Specifically, our approach models cash bail decisions as a probabilis-
tic process whereby judges balance the relative costs of assigning
cash bail with the cost of defendants potentially skipping court
dates, and where these skip probabilities are estimated based upon
features of the individual case. We then use Monte Carlo inference
to sample the distribution over these costs for different magistrates
and across different races. We fit this model to a data set we have
collected of over 50,000 court cases in the Allegheny and Philadel-
phia counties in Pennsylvania. Our analysis of 50 separate judges
shows that they are uniformly more likely to assign cash bail to
black defendants than to white defendants, even given identical like-
lihood of skipping a court appearance. This analysis raises further
questions about the equity of the practice of cash bail, irrespective
of its underlying legal justification.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the criminal justice system, cash bail is the often-used practice
of requiring that defendants pay a monetary fee in order to be
released pretrial, which is returned upon making all necessary
court appearances. The inability to pay the set bail amount results
in defendants being detained in jail for no reason other than their
inability to pay an often arbitrarily large fee. The practice has come
under a great deal of criticism, with many experts arguing that
it violates the underlying notion of “innocent until proven guilty.”

Indeed, such pretrial detention, for those unable to afford bail, or
for those who need to seek commercial bail bonds in order to secure
their bail, is one of the main drivers of the United States’ growing
incarceration rate [21].
The effects of pretrial detention are larger than just ensuring
a defendant appears at their trial; there are lasting, devastating
consequences on individual, family, and job security [19]. Pretrial
detention has been found to coerce defendants to plead guilty, re-
gardless of reality, for the opportunity to return home, rebuild their
lives and prepare for trial [31]. Moreover, several other studies have
found that pretrial detention increases the likelihood of conviction,
increases the chance that a defendant will receive a mandatory
minimum sentence if charged, and increases the defendant’s ulti-
mate sentence [13, 37]. The use of cash bail alone has also been
suggested to make defendants more likely to recidivate [18], i.e. it
acts counter to the belief that our justice systems are rehabilitative.
Many jurisdictions have taken steps to address the concerns of cash
bail decisions, including changes in the necessary requirements
for a magistrate to issue cash bail, the use of pretrial risk assess-
ments with the intent to curb human biases in the decision-making
process, or altogether stopping cash bail practices [20].
In addition to the studied effects of cash bail, a further issue
arises in considering the disparate rates of its use across groups
(ie. race, gender, sexual identity, etc). Many prior studies describe
this disparity by demonstrating the different rates of cash bail
assignments with respect to race, gender, wealth, etc. However,
as has been recently highlighted by the statistics community in
many other settings, such benchmark tests are susceptible to the
problem of infra-marginality. Due to differences in the unobserved
marginal distributions, observing average outcomes does not yield
enough information in order to determine whether a particular
decision-making process is biased [10, 24, 34]. The outcomes that
we observe may or may not be a necessary result of the current
reality.
In this paper, we propose a stylizedmodel of bail decisions, which
directly estimates how cash bail assignments result from different
(abstract) decision-making costs associated with defendants appear-
ing in court – i.e., we assume that cash bail is assigned if the “ex-
pected cost” of assigning cash bail is lower than the “expected cost”
of the defendant potentially failing to appear for a court date (FTA).
This captures a loose categorization of the National Association of
pretrial Services Agencies (NAPSA) 2020 guiding principles [27]
for pretrial decision making in that: 1) the goal of bail setting is
to find a bail amount and bail type that maximizes a defendant’s
likelihood of pretrial release, while ensuring a defendant’s court
appearance; 2) these bail decisions and amounts should not im-
pose a disparate or discriminatory outcome based on race, gender,
sexual identity and other legally protected attributes; 3) pretrial

detention should be limited only to those defendants who pose an
unmanageable risk to public safety. Under the proposed model, we
infer a latent variable which captures the cost that each magistrate
believes that society bears by a defendant being unable to pay the
set cash bail versus the cost of this defendant failing to appear for
a court date (itself based upon a linear model of probability of an
FTA as a function of the covariates describing the particular case
in question). Because we specifically allow these probabilities to
depend upon group characteristics such as the race of the defendant,
the model separates out the relative decision-making costs of bail
from the actual probabilities involved. This enables the model to
deal with the infra-marginality problem to some degree, and we es-
timate the mechanism behind a magistrate’s cash bail decisions even
accounting for potential differences in FTA rates amongst different
groups.
We estimate these costs by creating a dataset of 89, 751 court
dockets from Philadelphia and Allegheny counties in Pennsylvania
from the years 2016 to 2019. We then fit the model parameters
for the 50 most active magistrates within our dataset. Here, we
found that nearly every one of the 50 most active magistrates shows
a greater willingness to assign cash bail to Black defendants than to
White defendants, even given equal probabilities of skipping trial. In
other words, for two defendants with the same relative probability
of skipping their court appearance, judges were uniformly more
likely to assign cash bail to a Black defendant. This is particularly
striking given the fact that some of the simpler baseline analyses
(such as simply comparing bail assignment rates for black and
white defendants) show more similar treatment for each group.
From a more algorithmic perspective, we believe our methodology
also presents a valuable contribution to work on addressing infra-
marginality problems via Bayesian modeling. While past work has
addressed similar questions, to the best of our knowledge ours is the
first to simultaneously estimate a full parametric predictive model
of relevant outcomes that includes group identifying components,
while simultaneously attempting to estimate the relative costs of
decisions based upon these groups. Thus, we believe that the current
work presents both an important study from a societal perspective,
and a methodological advance of interest to the broader algorithmic
community.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATEDWORK
In this section, we introduce the pretrial process, as it relates to bail
decision-making in Allegheny County and Philadelphia County,
and address prior analysis for this aspect of the judicial process.
2.1 The Process of Cash Bail
In Philadelphia County, after an arrest, typically a video confer-
ence is set up between a magistrate and a defendant, where the
magistrate will assign a bail type and bail amount in a hearing that
generally lasts one to three minutes [25, 26]. Each shift of bail hear-
ings takes place for approximately four hours every day, with one
of Philadelphia’s six arraignment court magistrates presiding over
each shift [17]. Pretrial processes work much the same in Allegheny
county, where one of 46 magisterial district judges will preside over
a preliminary arraignment in which a defendant’s bail is set. Bail
need not be set only at the preliminary arraignment, it may also be
set during a preliminary hearing or bail hearing. However, in most
criminal cases, it is set at this preliminary arraignment.
Of the bail types assigned, a magistrate has the option under the
law [2] to choose one of the following:
(1) Release on recognizance (ROR) – a written agreement from
a defendant to appear on their court date. This agreement
may come with additional stipulations, but does not require
any monetary commitment.
(2) Release on nonmonetary conditions – a magistrate may re-
lease a defendant on nonmonetary bail if they believe that
set conditions such as restricting travel or requiring the de-
fendant to report in are sufficient for their court appearance.
(3) Release on nominal bail – a magistrate may release a defen-
dant on nominal bail by requiring a small amount of money
(eg. one dollar) and another entity (a person or organization)
to act as surety.
(4) Release on unsecured bail – a magistrate may release a defen-
dant on unsecured bail by requiring a written agreement that
the defendant becomes liable for the set amount of money
in the event of non-appearance. This does not require any
money or other form of security in order to be released.
(5) Release on monetary bail – a magistrate may release a de-
fendant on cash bail if they believe that a defendant will
be unlikely to comply with the conditions of release with-
out an immediate guarantee. In Allegheny County, the bail
authority may require that individual to pay no more than
10% of the full bail amount in order to secure their release.
If a defendant is unable to pay, they will be detained until
trial [4]. In Allegheny County, cash bail should not be set
unless a magistrate investigates the defendant’s financial
background and finds that the set amount is reasonable [3].
2.2 Implications of Cash Bail Assignments
If a defendant is detained pretrial because the set bail was not rea-
sonable then there can be serious consequences, both inside and
outside of the case. In a qualitative assessment of 23 interviews
among defendants who pled guilty, Euvrard and Leclerc [16] found,
among other effects, that pretrial detention acts as a coercive mech-
anism in which by pleading guilty, the defendant can avoid jail time,
whereas by pursuing a trial, the defendant will have to wait in jail
for an undetermined amount of time. Similarly, some interviewees
acknowledged that the jail-time offered by accepting a plea deal
may be equivalent to their time spent in jail by waiting for trial.
Pleading guilty often leads to the minimum amount of time spent
in jail, regardless of innocence or guilt.
Further quantitative studies have confirmed similar effects. In a
study of New York’s pretrial outcomes, by regressing conviction
and pretrial detainment on defendants’ relevant features, Leslie and
Pope [22] found a positive correlation between pretrial detainment
and conviction. In other words, the authors find that the more
likely a judge is to detain an individual pretrial, the more likely that
this individual pleads guilty or is convicted of a crime. In a similar
analysis, Dobbie et al. [14] use a measure of judge leniency, based
on the residuals of release decisions in a probit model, in order to
estimate the influence of the assigned magistrate on pretrial release
and its subsequent effects on future crime, court appearances, and
2

employment. They find that while pretrial release increases the
likelihood of failing to appear, release both decreases the likelihood
of rearrest over the next two years and increases the likelihood of
having any income over the next two years.
In particular, such models generally follow the rationale that the
impact that the presiding authority has on a case can be isolated
and that we can estimate regression coefficients for outcomes in
ways that glean new insights, as in the example below. For example,
Gupta et al. [18] propose a regression model
Zict jo =
1
nct jo − 1
∑
k,i
(
Bailkct jo
)

(1)
Outcomeict jo = α + βBailicto + δX ′
icto + ϵict jo (2)
Bailict jo = α + γZict jo + X
′ζ + νict jo (3)
where Bailict jo is an indicator for whether or not cash bail was
set for defendant i with offense o in court c for year t by judge j
and X ′ are defendant controls, such as age, race, gender, charges,
priors, etc. Zict j is a measure of judge leniency, calculated as the
difference in leave-one-out means of a judge’s rate of cash bail
assignments compared to the rate of cash bail assignments for court
c . A litany of prior literature [7, 15, 18, 19, 36] uses such methods
based on probit/logistic regression models with or without residual
measures of judge leniency/severity in order to model how our
observed pretrial data influences defendant outcomes after their
preliminary arraignments/bail hearings, with most work coming
to similar conclusions.
2.3 Disparate Rates of Cash Bail Assignments
Due to the harmful long-term impact of cash bail use, further work
has sought to verify whether or not magistrates assign cash bail
uniformly among demographic groups. For cases in which a judge
assigned cash bail, prior work [6, 12, 32, 35, 38] has reviewed pretrial
decisions for instances of judge bias and found that across the
state of Pennsylvania, the proportion of Black defendants who are
assigned cash bail is significantly greater than the proportion of
their non-Black counterparts who were assigned cash bail, with
additional work [33] finding that even after controlling for the
types of crimes, judges still assign cash bail to Black and White
defendants differently for the same crime in 20% of cases.
Furthermore, a 2019 investigation by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) [6] found that cash bail was assigned in as many as
25% of cases, with some magistrates setting cash bail in up to 57%
of cases. In Philadelphia, a 2018 review by the ACLU found that
upwards of 43% of defendants were assigned cash bail [30]. Other
studies [28, 33] have also found cash bail assignment rates ranging
from 40% to 70% over all magistrates.
Beyond biases along racial lines, a 2017 class action suit brought
against Harris County, Texas [1] argued that the county had been
using money bail on misdemeanor defendants who could not pay.
The district court, who’s ruling was later affirmed by the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals, “concluded [that] Hearing Officers were
aware that, by imposing a secured bail on indigent arrestees, they
were ensuring that those arrestees would remain detained.” [1]. In
essence, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, we see trends that show
that cash bail has been used as a barrier to justice for individuals of
a certain race or financial status.
2.4 The Problem of Infra-Marginality in Cash
Bail Assignments
Among the studies on both the disparate rate of cash bail assign-
ment and the downstream effects of cash bail, there has been a
growing emphasis that the methods employed in these studies may
not be able to show the entire story [24]. Specifically, such meth-
ods are susceptible to the problem of infra-marginality. As coined
in [10], the infra-marginality problem notes that our observed data
is only able to provide average outcomes and not the outcomes
associated with the marginal decisions. This problem has the po-
tential to undermine analyses that are based solely on the observed
information, causing such work to be unable to provide a complete
picture of the underlying reasons for observed disparities. Beyond
the infra-marginality problem, studies of bail decisions are also
susceptible to Simpson’s paradox, where the marginal association
between categorical variables changes after controlling for one or
more other variables.
As an illustrative example, suppose that there exist two groups
with different probabilities of missing their court dates, and that
there exists some threshold where a judge assigns cash bail to all
defendants whose court failure to appear (FTA) probability exceeds
this threshold. We may observe that one group is assigned cash bail
at a higher rate than a second and we may observe that under a
judge’s cash bail assignments, one group is less likely to miss a court
appearance than another, we may reasonably conclude that there
is bias in a judge’s decisions. However, without prior knowledge of
the underlying distributions and the marginal decision threshold,
there exist cases in which these seemingly biased outcomes occur
without an bias on the part of the judge. For example, figure 1
shows two hypothetical cases in which both the rate of cash bail
assignment for the red and blue groups (0.55, 0.35) and the expected
FTA rate for those who were assigned cash bail for each group
(0.311, 0.335) does not change.
These observed statistics tell us that a judge is assigning cash
bail to the red group at a higher rate, and that the expected FTA rate
for defendants in the red group who are assigned cash bail is also
lower than the expected FTA rate for those members in the blue
group who receive cash bail. This may be indicative of some bias
on the part of the judge. However, if we consider the judge’s bail
assignment thresholds, the first case shows that the judge is using
a consistent decision threshold, irrespective of group membership.
The disparate rates of cash bail assignment are not based on bias on
the part of the judge, but a result of each group’s marginal FTA rate.
In the second case, the rate of cash bail assignments and expected
FTA rates under cash bail assignments remain the same as in the
first case, however, the decision threshold shows that the judge
is assigning cash bail to members of the red group who have a
lower probability of failing to appear than the blue group. Here,
the differences in cash bail assignment rates and FTA rates are
actually a result of bias on the part of the judge. The problem of
infra-marginality lies in such cases, where, due to the fact that we
cannot observe the marginal distribution of FTA probabilities, the
observed data is unable to differentiate between the regime where
a judge favors one group and one where judges are unbiased with
respect to group membership. For a more detailed example, see [34].

probabilities: red=Beta(6,18), blue=Beta(2,8). (Right) Exam-
ple Beta Distributions of FTA probabilities: red=Beta(1,4),
blue=Beta(2,8); In both cases, thresholds are set so that the
proportion above the threshold are 0.55 and 0.35 for red and
blue groups respectively. Additionally thresholds are set so
that expectation above the threshold are 0.311 and 0.335 re-
spectively. Outcome statistics remain unchanged despite the
threshold’s reflecting different policies by a judge.
Ayres [10] explicitly argues that the bail-bond setting avoids the
infra-marginality problem. The author argues that that the problem
in cash bail assignment is non-dichotomous, as judges also assign
a continuous variable, bail amount. By assigning bail amounts in
a way that changes individual FTA probabilities, we effectively
marginalize the distribution over all covariates, so that the observed
outcomes are outcomes on the true marginal distribution. However,
while the assigned bail amount is continuous, the decision to assign
cash bail in the first place is dichotomous; judges choose to use
cash bail in lieu of four other options. Before cash bail amounts are
considered, we are already in the setting in which Ayres argues
that the problem of infra-marginality undermines outcome tests.
Even considering the setting where we condition on defendants
who were assigned cash bail, the notion that bail amounts allow
us to avoid this problem requires the assumption that a judge acts
on full knowledge of a defendant’s ability to pay, which is unlikely
given the short (1-3 minute) nature of preliminary hearings. If a
judge assigns cash bail at an amount that a defendant cannot pay,
then we are still effectively marginalizing over two distinct sub-
groups, those defendants detained pretrial and those defendants
released on cash bail. Such observations are then subject to Simp-
son’s paradox, in which the trends change after again conditioning
on those who are released pretrial on cash bail.
Moreover, such models as equation (3), that emphasize a residual
measure of judge leniency, are also susceptible to infra-marginality
effects. For instance, the model above can be simplified to
Outcomeict jo = α + βγZict jo + (δ + ζ )X ′
icto + ϵict jo + νict jo (4)
As judge leniency measures themselves are the difference of suc-
cessive benchmark tests, emphasizing measures of judge leniency
introduces a new component that suffers from the problem of infra-
marginality. While such analyses provide valuable insight, finding
ways to address this shortcoming is valuable for a full understand-
ing of such processes.
This issue of infra-marginality has been directly addressed in a
different setting [29, 34] in an analysis of nationwide traffic stops,
with a hierarchical Bayesian model that fits a threshold to the
marginal probability distribution of contraband possession among
groups. Officers are not expected to search a vehicle unless the
likelihood of contraband possession is above this fit threshold. This
setup avoids the issue of infra-marginality, by not directly basing
indicators of bias on the observed outcomes, but on the latent
variables that describe these outcomes.
We follow a similar problem setup in this work, in which we
posit a hierarchical Bayesian model of cash bail assignments based
on the a group’s FTA (failure to appear) rate and their pretrial re-
lease rate. The FTA and release probabilities are then used to fit
a latent variable, based on a magistrate’s perceived societal cost
of members of a group failing to appear for their court dates or
being unable to post their bail. In our approach, the latent variables
describing economic costs and the parameters of the predictive
model are simultaneously estimated via MCMC sampling. Thus,
the model presented here makes contributions on both the algorith-
mic and societal levels, in two ways: 1) providing a new example
in which Bayesian modeling may be able to address problems of
infra-marginality in complex decision-making systems 2) adding to
existing evidence within the conversation regarding group-based
biases within the United States judicial system.
3 A BAYESIAN HIERARCHICAL BAIL
ASSIGNMENT MODEL
In order to mitigate the infra-marginality effect, we take a similar
approach as Simoiu et al. [34] in creating a generative model that
compares the probability distributions of different groups, and finds
outcomes which are dependent on both the probability distribu-
tions and a latent variable that describes the underlying beliefs for
each magistrate. Here, we assume a simple process bail assignment.
We base this analysis on two major assumptions for the behavior
of judges: 1) That cash bail should be a means of decreasing the
likelihood that a defendant will fail to appear for a court appearance
2) Judges act rationally, using cash bail to minimize the balance in
costs between assigning cash bail and defendants missing a court
date. In other words, we disregard the possibility that cash bail is
used in a punitive manner by any judge, and assuming that judges
assign cash bail in order to minimize some (abstract) cost. While
these assumptions may not always be satisfied in practice [1], we
are effectively assuming the commonly understood purpose of bail,
that bail is simply meant to ensure defendants will appear for trial
and all pretrial hearings for which they must be present [9] and
that (as per law) judges apply the least restrictive conditions that
will reasonable ensure a defendant’s attendance at future court
proceedings and enhance public safety [8].
Our model then follows the rationale that whenever a case comes
before the presiding authority, all available information, x ∈ Rd ,
such as severity of the charged crime and number of prior crimes,
dictates the probability of this defendant not appearing on their
trial date. We model this probability of failing to appear as a logistic
model with a Normal prior on the weights,
θfta ∼ N(0, 2I ). (5)
4
830
A Bayesian Model of Cash Bail Decisions FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
To model the effect of cash bail on FTA rates, we introduce an
additional coefficient with prior θb1 ∼ N+(σb ), where N+ is the
half-normal distribution (making the reasonable assumption that
adding cash bail should not increase the probability of failing to
appear for a court date). Thus, the probability of missing a court
date is given as,
Pr[fta|b] = σ (θTftax − θb1b + θ0), (6)
where σ is the sigmoid function, b is the indicator for whether or
not cash bail was assigned and θ0 ∼ N(0, 2) is a bias term, again
with a Normal prior.
Secondly, we consider the case where the presiding authority
may be assigning the bail amount in excess of what the defendant
is able to reasonably pay. We model the probability of a defendant’s
release for any type of bail by a second logistic model with a Normal
prior
θrelease ∼ N(0, 2I ) (7)
and the probability of being released pretrial given by
Pr[release|b] = σ (θTreleasex − θb2b + θ1), (8)
where, σ is the sigmoid, θb2 ∼ N+(σb ), and θ1 ∼ N(0, 2) is bias
term.
After estimating these probabilities, each magistrate determines
whether to set cash bail based on a tradeoff between the probability
of the defendant appearing if released pretrial with/without cash
bail, and the probability of them being able to post their bail if cash
bail is assigned. Each magistrate has a measure of societal harm
induced by a defendant not coming to their trial. We represent this
cost of not appearing, as the latent variable τ1 ∼ N+(σ ).
Should the presiding authority believe that cash bail is an appro-
priate assignment for a defendant, they legally must still ensure that
the bail amount is reasonable. While reasonable may mean different
things to different magistrates, we represent the cost of the defen-
dant facing pretrial incarceration (i.e., having cash bail imposed
and being unable to pay) via the latent variable τ2 ∼ N+(σ ).
3.1 Cost Model
In themodel here, these underlying beliefs,τ1, τ2, determinewhether
cash bail is an effective tool for bringing a specific defendant to
their trial date. If a defendant is likely to not appear for a court
appearance, regardless of the type of bail set, instead of setting cash
bail, a magistrate will opt to deny bail to the defendant. However, if
cash bail acts as a deterrent for a missed court appearance and the
defendant can afford it, then the magistrate will instead choose to
set cash bail. Alternatively, if the defendant cannot afford bail, and
they are still unlikely to miss their court date under non-monetary
release, the magistrate will choose not to use cash bail.
We represent this dilemma as choosing the option that minimizes
the cost of setting cash bail,
τ1Pr[fta|cash bail = 1] + τ2(1 − Pr[post|cash bail = 1]) (9)
or the cost of not using cash bail,
τ1Pr[fta|cash bail = 0] + τ2(1 − Pr[post|cash bail = 0]) (10)
(Note if cash bail is not used, then the defendant posts bail with prob-
ability 1). For convenience in notation, let pb [Y ] = Pr[Y |cash bail =

Figure 2: Generative model describing how magistrates set

plate.
b]. In this model cash bail is assigned if,
τ1p1[fta] + τ2(1 − p1[release]) ≤ τ1p0[fta] (11)
Rather than estimating both τ1, τ2, we simplify this equation to
have a single latent variable, τ = τ1
τ2 , τ ∼ C+(0, 1), where C+ is the
Half-Cauchy distribution. This distribution is chosen by considering
the case where τ1, τ2 are both Half-Normal random variables with
the same variance. The ratio distribution, τ1
τ2 is itself a random
Half-Cauchy variable with location 0 and scale 1.
Simplifying equation (11), cash bail is set if,
τ (p0[fta] − p1[fta]) − (1 − p1[release]) ≥ 0. (12)
We would like to enforce this constraint by modeling the observed
cash bail as a Bernoulli random variable, with probability,
p̂(cash bail) = σ
(
τ (p0[fta] − p1[fta]) − (1 − p1[release])
)
, (13)
where σ is the inverse logit function. In doing so, we capture the
notion that as the cost of setting cash bail increases, the probability
of setting cash bail falls.
While ideally it captures our constraint, in its current form, the
inverse logit alone cannot model the probability of bail decisions
due to the bias being governed by (1 − p1[cash bail]. This bias is
limited to the range [0, 1], which in turn would cause the output
probabilities to range from [ 1
1+e , 1], instead of [0, 1]. In order to
address this, we rescale the sigmoid outputs in order to force the
probability of assigning cash bail back into the [0, 1] range. The
marginal probability of being assigned cash bail is just given by,
p(cashbail) =
p̂(cashbail) − 1

Our final hierarchical Bayesian model is shown in Figure 2.
3.2 Bail Amounts
Finally, it is worth noting that while the set cash bail amount is
available in our data, we do not include it in this model. In order to

log bail amounts for defendants accused of felony drug of-
fenses and who saw any of the five most common magis-

in these cases is too wide for meaningful inference, so we
do not include it in our analysis. The stochasticity of a mag-
istrate’s assigned cash bail amountsmay be instructive in its
own right as a metric for understanding judicial treatment.
estimate the cost of setting/not setting cash bail, we need counter-
factual information on bail assignments. The probability of failing
to appear for a court appearance is designed so that the counterfac-
tual cash bail assignment is easily computable, however, due to the
inherent stochasticity of the bail amounts that judges choose, we
found that a counterfactual assignment of cash bail will not provide
a reasonable estimate of what a defendant’s bail amount would be
had the judge set cash/non-monetary bail.
If we consider the defendants whowere assigned cash bail by one
of themagistrates in our dataset and accused of similar crimes/crime
severity, after normalizing their feature vectors and selecting a sub-
set of these defendants whose euclidean distance is less than 0.05,
we obtain a set of defendants who we would expect to have compa-
rable bail amounts. Figure 3 presents a histogram of this subset of
defendants with felony drug offenses for the five most active magis-
trates in our dataset. Ideally, we would like to perform a regression
with a bail indicator in order to approximate counterfactual effects,
similarly to our approach to approximating FTA probabilities and
bail posting probabilities. However, the variance of the log bail
amounts is too large for meaningful estimations of counterfactuals.
This tells us that bail amount assignments are far too stochastic
for the granularity of data that we use here. Instead we rely on the
colinearity of our other features with the log bail amounts in order
to reasonably estimate the counterfactual bail posting and failure
to appear probabilities without directly including the amounts as
covariates.
4 DATA COLLECTION AND BENCHMARK
TESTS
Our dataset of cash bail decisions makes use of the publicly avail-
able Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania’s Web Portal, which
records all court dockets for cases in the state of Pennsylvania. The
website provides a pdf for each docket and pdf summary file for
each defendant’s criminal history. The Pennsylvania judiciary also
includes a separate API, in which users can retrieve json formatted
files of case information. We use text-extraction tools in order to
retrieve an individual’s history from the summary pdf and combine
this with the json docket information.
We performed this process on 33, 566 records from the Court of
Common Pleas in Philadelphia, 66, 982 from the court of Common
Pleas in Allegheny county, with a total set of 89, 751 cases from
January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 over these two counties.
From each docket-summary pair, we extract a feature vector for
each case that consists of:
(1) Magistrate Categorical identifier for which magistrate set
the defendant’s bail.
(2) Race: Binary variable, White/Black.
(3) Sex: Binary variable, Male/Female.
(4) Age: Defendant’s age when the case was filed
(5) Lead Offense Type: Categorical identifier of the defen-
dant’s lead offense (eg. First/Second/Third Degree Felony or
Misdemeanor).
(6) Lead Offense Description: Categorical identifier for the
lead offense based on the lead offense’s statute number: Of-
fenses against Public Administration, Offenses against Prop-
erty, Offenses Involving Danger to the Person, Drug Offenses,
Inchoate Crimes, Vehicle Offenses, Driving after Imbibing
Alcohol or Utilizing Drugs, Miscellaneous Offenses
(7) Number of charges: Number of charges brought against
the defendant in the current case
(8) Attorney Type: Categorical variable, Public Defense Attor-
ney, Private Defense Attorney, Attorney Waived.
(9) Number of Prior Felonies: Categorical variable of prior
felony convictions; zero prior convictions, one to two prior
convictions, three to five prior convictions, six to nine prior
convictions, ten or more convictions.
(10) Number of Prior Misdemeanors: Categorical variable of
prior misdemeanors; zero prior convictions, one to two prior
convictions, three to five prior convictions, six to nine prior
convictions, ten or more convictions.
(11) Bail Status: Categorical variable of the status of the defen-
dant’s bail; Bail Set, Bail Posted, Bail Forfeited, Bail Revoked.
Anyone who has not had their bail status changed from "Bail
Set" is treated as being detained pretrial. Individuals whose
status is, "Bail Posted", "Bail Forfeited", and "Bail Revoked"
are all treated as having posted bail and been released pre-
trial.
(12) Bail Type: Categorical variable of the defendant’s bail type;
Monetary Bail, Unsecured Bail, Non-monetary Bail, Nominal
Bail. We only consider the bail set at an initial hearing and
not subsequent changes to bail types and amounts
(13) Fail to Appear: Binary variable describing whether or not
the defendant did not appear on their court date.
(14) Census Based Confounders: Each docket contains the de-
fendant’s zip code or city of residence. We try to minimize
confounders such as socioeconomic status or education level
by including the following for each defendant based on the

4.1 Pennsylvania’s Clean Slate Law
Signed in 2018, Pennsylvania has implemented the first-of-its-kind
“Clean Slate” law, which begun to seal millions of criminal records in
an effort to allow Pennsylvania residents who have not been found
guilty of serious crimes (eg. violence, sexual assault, homicide, etc.)
to more easily continue with their lives. This law seals records so
that they do not show up in employer background searches nor
in Pennsylvania’s online docket database. It allows persons whose
cases have been sealed to act as if their offense had never occurred.
As a result of this law, we base our analysis on cases stemming
from the Court of Common Pleas, rather than Municipal Courts,
as the Court of Common Pleas sees more serious crimes and has
fewer cases which are not sealed under the “Clean Slate” law. This
allows a more consistent measurement among court decisions and
will hopefully minimize the effects of covariate shift from before to
after the "Clean Slate" law.
4.2 Initial Data Statistics
Again, the data used in this analysis consists of court filings from
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia County, Penn-
sylvania from 2016 to 2019 in the Court of Common Pleas and
Magisterial District Courts. The Court of Common Pleas hears ma-
jor civil and criminal cases, as opposed to the Municipal Courts.
After removing cases with either missing or ignored features, our
dataset’s descriptive statistics are given below.

4.3 Pretrial Failure
In the dataset used here, the number of cases in which defendants
miss their court dates (0.047− 0.061) is noticeably lower than other
analyses of cash bail which have failure to appear rates of: 0.258
(Philadelphia only; Release pretrial) [7], 0.179 (Philadelphia and
Miami Dade County; Released pretrial) [14], 0.121 (Philadelphia and
MiamiDade County; Detained pretrial) [14], 0.17 (Philadelphia only;
eligible under Philadelphia DA’s No-Cash-Bail policy) [28], 0.06
(Philadelphia only; ineligible under Philadelphia DA’s No-Cash-Bail
policy) [28]. However, for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, the average
rate of missed court appearance for the Common Pleas Court in
Philadelphia was 0.043 [23]. From our review, there is no clear and
consistent notice that a defendant did not appear at their court date
within the publicly available dockets. We flag a defendant as having
failed to appear at their court date if one of two cases is satisfied
within the docket: 1) if the related docket both lists their bail as
having been revoked/forfeited and the reason for being revoked
explicitly lists that either the defendant did not appear or that a
bench warrant was put out 2) if a bench warrant was authorized
and if the comments within the case registry entry explictly states
that the defendant did not appear.
Failure to appear rates are only a single aspect of pretrial fail-
ure. Defendants may fail their pretrial release conditions by being
arrested for a new crime while waiting for their trials. Again, the
dockets do not provide a clear and consistent notice that an individ-
ual was arrested while awaiting trial. While the court summaries
do provide a view of all arrests for an individual, in many cases, the
same incident was recorded multiple times, and it may also be pos-
sible that an individual was arrested in other jurisdictions, although
this case is likely an uncommon occurrence over all cases. Without
the ability to cross-reference our dataset with prison records, we are
unable to confidently determine if an individual was arrested again
pretrial. As a result, we focus on a more limited view of pretrial
failure by only considering whether individuals missed their court
date.
4.4 Additional Data Challenges
There were several other features that we would have liked to in-
clude, yet ultimately decided to remove from our dataset. In future
bail analyses, it may be worth considering how some of these fea-
tures play into the cost model. Such features include a) whether
or not a defendant had violated their probation when they were
arrested; and b) the time since a defendant’s most recent arrest.
For the former, the dockets are unclear onwhether probation was
violated when the defendant was arrested. Some cases reference
a violation of probation hearing, yet we are not confident that the
occurrence of this hearing should be the sole indicator of whether
a defendant was in violation of their probation. Concerning the
latter, we are unable to retrieve prison data for each defendant, so
there are likely cases where arrest dates would not differentiate
between someone who was released 20 years ago and only recently
rearrested, and someone who was imprisoned for 20 years and im-
mediately rearrested. While both of these are highly consequential
in determining bail, including this information would at best give
us an extremely noisy estimate of the true features.
4.5 Considerations on Data Release
The data used in this analysis has been released under the following
github repository: https://github.com/jnwilliams/padockets.
In releasing the full data, we have consulted with members of the
7
833
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada 1 and 1
Pennsylvania ACLU on the necessary protections for the individu-
als represented within. Following their recommendations, we have
anonymized the data by a) removing any reference to the referred
docket identifiers; b) replacing magistrate names with a numerical
identifier; c) replacing exact docket filing/arrest dates with only
the month and year; d) removing specific ages of defendants and
instead providing an age range over 5 years, beginning from 18
years of age; e) replacing the median income for the defendant’s zip
code with an income range of $5,000; f) replacing the statistics for
an individuals zip code (ie. high school and college graduation rate,
poverty rate, unemployment rate) with a range of 5% (eg. poverty
rate of 7% is presented as 5-10%).
We feel that releasing the full dataset may be beneficial for future
analyses, however in making this data public, our goal was to make
retrieving information for any particular case within this dataset
no easier to obtain here, than by searching through the Unified
Judicial System of Pennsylvania’s online portal.
5 MODELING RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
We estimate the posterior of our random variables using PyMC4 Pre-
Release, a probabilistic modeling language built on top of Tensor-
Flow Probability [5]. PyMC4 uses the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS),
a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in order to sample from the
posterior.
5.1 Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling
In high-dimensional spaces, commonly used techniques for sam-
pling from the posterior distribution, such as theMetropolis-Hastings
Algorithm or Gibbs Sampling, are susceptible to getting stuck in
pathological regions of high curvature. In these spaces, the volume
of the neighborhood around the mode of a distribution vanishes as
the dimensionality increases, while the neighborhood away from
the mode has an increasingly large volume, yet vanishing proba-
bilities. As a result, both of these neighborhoods have a negligible
effect on the expectation. In such high-dimensional spaces, explo-
ration of the typical set can lead to the discovery of small regions
of high curvature. As Monte Carlo Integration recovers a distri-
bution’s expectation asymptotically, sampling procedures tend to
compensate for being unable to explore such pathological regions
by spending large amounts of time exploring them when they get
the opportunity. This long period of exploration causes MCMC to
fail, as the sampled mean approaches the expectation within this
region of high curvature rather than the expectation of the full
distribution.
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling avoids this issue via a more
effective sampling procedure that numerically integrates along
the gradient of the log-posterior in order to oscillate around the
typical set, rather than perform a random walk. See [11], for a
full introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Following
standard practice, our sampling procedure consists of 2 phases, a
burn-in phase, in which we sample from a random starting point
until the posterior samples move toward the typical set. After this
pre-set number of burn-in steps, the final posterior sampling process
begins so as to give us our final parameters. In order to ensure that
the posterior is notmultimodal, it is common to perform this process
over multiple Markov chains. In this study, we found that 5 chains,

fendants assigned cash bail vs proportion of Misdemeanor

500 burn in steps and 1, 500 sampling steps were sufficient for all
chains to converge.
5.2 Results from latent variable model
Based on the average estimated τ produced when estimating the
parameters of our model, Figure 4 shows that nearly every magis-
trate has a striking difference in the costs of missing a court date
for Black defendants as opposed to White defendants. Recall that
our model defines τ as the ratio of the cost of missing a court date
to the cost of being unable to post cash bail, so a greater τ implies
that a judge is more willing to assign cash bail to a group in a way
that minimizes the risk of missing their court date, regardless of an
8

A Bayesian Model of Cash Bail Decisions FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
Figure 5: Difference in τ among seasons
individual’s ability to post bail. While a few magistrates have τ less
then 1 for white defendants (implying that they want to make sure
that these defendants are released pretrial) no magistrate has τ less
than 1 for black defendants. Most magistrates place an outstand-
ingly high emphasis on a defendant missing their court date for all
defendants, but this trend is exacerbated based on racial differences,
which is in line with the higher rate at which these magistrates
assign cash bail to Black defendants.
Over these magistrates, the cash bail assignment rate sits at an
average 75% decrease in the likelihood of being assigned cash bail
when comparing their treatment of black defendants as opposed to
white defendants. While such an change is indicative of a direction
of bias, the results based on τ give a more actionable response to
this behavior. The majority of judges have high τ values for Black
defendants, with the median value being 19.51, whereas White
defendants have a median τ 8.82. In this case, it is much more
clear that the action for improving pretrial release rates requires
addressing magistrate bail assignments or assigned bail amounts
for Black defendants.
Similarly when comparing τ for men and women, we see a simi-
lar trend in which most judges assign cash bail with less regard for
male defendant’s ability to pay. In this case, there may be confound-
ing reasons why a magistrate may be more willing to ensure that
women are able to be released pretrial, such as child care. We see a
similar trend in the greater proportion in which male defendants
are assigned cash bail, however, as in the case or racial differences,
we are able to better pinpoint the specific judges who place lower
cost on some individuals being unable to pay their bail than others.
This again can be a more targeted mechanism for addressing the
the cash bail assignment habits of the magistrates.
We also consider two additional settings in which we want to
determine the disparate treatment of those defendants accused of
felonies compared misdemeanors and the treatment of defendants
with respect to the season (ie. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). Both
of these act as validation for the simple model here. As conven-
tional wisdom would suggest that those defendants accused of
felonies are significantly more likely to be assigned cash bail than
Figure 6: Average difference of the bail assignment rate via
the posterior draws compared to the true bail assignment
rate with respect to each subgroup.
defendants accused of misdemeanors, and that the treatment of de-
fendants should remain relatively constant regardless of the season,
we expect that this analysis would show similar effects.
For those defendants accused of felonies, magistrates are much
more concerned with ensuring that these defendants appear at their
trial date, hence they are significantly more likely to assign cash
bail. Many magistrates assign cash bail so as to ensure that those
who are accused of misdemeanors are able to be released pretrial.
However, still we show that there are some who are relatively
unconcerned with defendants being able to post bail, regardless of
offense severity.
Figure 5 provides the comparison of τ based on seasons, where
Spring groups together all cases between March to May of any year,
Summer groups together all cases between June to August, Fall
takes place from September to November, and Winter is December
to January. In this additional validation step, comparisons over τ
should not be susceptible to groupings in which we expect cash
bail assignments to be invariant, such as seasonal differences. Here,
we see this effect; there is little difference in τ among each season.
Our model is able to capture conventional wisdom on how cash
bail assignments are done regarding offense severity and groupings
in which these cash bail assignments should be invariant.
5.3 Posterior predictive checks
As a final robustness step of our model, we perform posterior predic-
tive checks on our observed variables. Such checks use the sampled
joint posterior distribution to generate new outcome variables for
every case, telling us, under our posterior, whether or not a specific
defendant will be assigned cash bail. We present these results in Fig-
ure 6. Ourmodel shows that among the groups (gender, race, offense
severity),we are able to match the expected cash bail assignment
rates of each magistrate, giving credence that the approximated τ
is able to act as a descriptor of magistrate behavior.
We do see a significant drop-off in accuracy for magistrates
who assign cash bail in less than 20% of cases. This is likely due
to a limitation in our model. Based on the cost model shown in
9
835
FAccT ’21, March 3–10, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada 1 and 1
equation (12), the co-domain of the difference in magisterial cost of
assigning cash bail is limited to the range [−1, inf). The re-scaling
done in equation (14) is able to successfully make this a probability
distribution, however, we still have significantly less flexibility in
cases in which magistrates are unlikely to assign cash bail. This
likely results in our model being unable to create a strong descriptor
among these magistrates.
While our model’s efficacy drops off for magistrates who have
low rates of cash bail assignment, in most circumstances, it is un-
likely that magistrates who assign cash bail in less than 20% of cases
are abusing the cash bail system to the extent that magistrates with
higher cash bail assignment rate may. As such, this model may
be useful to understand the behavior of problematic magistrates,
whereas other methods may be beneficial for less problematic mag-
istrates.
6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have revisited the infra-marginality problem for
cash bail assignments in pretrial decisions. There has been a signifi-
cant amount of work in understanding why judges assign cash bail
at disparate rates among groups, and when such analyses compare
the rate of observable outcomes such as bail assignment, recidi-
vism, or pretrial failure, these outcomes may in turn be influenced
by the unobserved features that cause an incomplete view of the
system. Much work attempts to mitigate these effects by includ-
ing measures of judge leniency in analyses on the influence cash
bail decisions, however, these measures may also be influenced by
exogenous variables.
We address this problem via Bayesian modeling, so as to focus
on understanding how well judge decision making matches both
the believed purposes and the legal requirements for setting cash
bail. This method may be useful in providing a more nuanced view
of why judges assign cash bail to certain groups at a higher rate
than others. In this work, we show not only that in the Court of
Common Pleas, magistrates universally assign a lower cost to Black
defendants being unable to be released pretrial as opposed to White
defendants, but that these estimated costs are able to avoid the infra-
marginality problem. Hence, these costs are more representative of
real world effects. By presenting this view in which we can directly
infer how judges value an individuals ability to pay cash bail, we can
better address disparities in the cash bail system, and more closely
target the exact mechanisms by which these disparate treatments
occur.
While the results presented here suggest specific values for the
underlying beliefs for each magistrate, due to the limitations here,
it would be beneficial to repeat this analysis with a dataset that
includes more information on pretrial failure, such as arrests for
other crimes while released pretrial. This is especially important,
because pretrial release decisions are based on more than miss-
ing a court date alone. For example, by replacing Pr[fta|cash bail]
with Pr[pretrial failure|cash bail] alone may provide a fuller view
of magistrate decision-making than we present here. Despite this,
we believe that the results presented here are an important study
that should be built on further, and that an additional method for
addressing the problem of infra-marginality in cash bail decisions
is a useful contribution for the broader algorithmic community.
