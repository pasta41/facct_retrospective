ABSTRACT
As machine learning is increasingly used to inform consequential
decision-making (e.g., pre-trial bail and loan approval), it becomes
important to explain how the system arrived at its decision, and
also suggest actions to achieve a favorable decision. Counterfactual
explanations –“how the world would have (had) to be different
for a desirable outcome to occur”– aim to satisfy these criteria.
Existing works have primarily focused on designing algorithms
to obtain counterfactual explanations for a wide range of settings.
However, it has largely been overlooked that ultimately, one of the
main objectives is to allow people to act rather than just under-
stand. In layman’s terms, counterfactual explanations inform an
individual where they need to get to, but not how to get there. In
this work, we rely on causal reasoning to caution against the use
of counterfactual explanations as a recommendable set of actions
for recourse. Instead, we propose a shift of paradigm from recourse
via nearest counterfactual explanations to recourse through minimal
interventions, shifting the focus from explanations to interventions.

tial decision-making in a number of contexts, e.g., denying a loan,
rejecting a job applicant, or prescribing life-altering medication. As

explanations that help the affected individuals to understand “why
a prediction was output”, as well as “how to act” to obtain a desired
outcome. Answering these questions, for the different stakeholders
involved, is one of the main goals of explainable machine learning
[7, 14, 20, 27, 32, 41, 42].
In this context, several works have proposed to explain a model’s
predictions of an affected individual using counterfactual explana-
tions, which are defined as statements of “how the world would
have (had) to be different for a desirable outcome to occur” [52].
Of specific importance are nearest counterfactual explanations, pre-
sented as the most similar instances to the feature vector describing
the individual, that result in the desired prediction from the model
[18, 26]. A closely related term is algorithmic recourse – the actions
required for, or “the systematic process of reversing unfavorable
decisions by algorithms and bureaucracies across a range of coun-
terfactual scenarios” – which is argued as the underwriting factor
for temporally extended agency and trust [50].
Counterfactual explanations have shown promise for practition-
ers and regulators to validate a model on metrics such as fairness
and robustness [18, 45, 49]. However, in their raw form, such ex-
planations do not seem to fulfill one of the primary objectives of
“explanations as a means to help a data-subject act rather than
merely understand” [52].
The translation of counterfactual explanations to recourse ac-
tions, i.e., to a recommendable set of actions to help an individual to
achieve a favourable outcome, was first explored in [49], where ad-
ditional feasibility constraints were imposed to support the concept
of actionable features (e.g., prevent asking the individual to reduce
their age or change their race). While a step in the right direction,
this work and others that followed [18, 31, 38, 45] implicitly assume
that the set of actions resulting in the desired output would directly
follow from the counterfactual explanation. This arises from the as-
sumption that “what would have had to be in the past” (retrodiction)
not only translates to “what should be in the future” (prediction) but
also to “what should be done in the future” (recommendation) [47].

We challenge this assumption and attribute the shortcoming of
existing approaches to their lack of consideration for real-world
properties, specifically the causal relationships governing the world
in which actions will be performed.
For ease of exposition, we present the following examples (see
[3] for additional examples).
Example 1: Consider, for example, the setting in Figure 1 where
an individual has been denied a loan and seeks an explanation
and recommendation on how to proceed. This individual has an
annual salary (X1) of $75, 000 and an account balance (X2) of $25, 000
and the predictor grants a loan based on the binary output of ℎ =
sgn(X1+5·X2−$225, 000). Existing approaches may identify nearest
counterfactual explanations as another individual with an annual
salary of $100, 000 (+%33) or a bank balance of $30, 000 (+%20),
therefore encouraging the individual to reapply when either of
these conditions are met. On the other hand, bearing in mind that
actions take place in a world where home-seekers save %30 of their
salary (i.e., X2 B 3/10 · X1 + U2), a salary increase of only %14 to
$85, 000 would automatically result in $3, 000 additional savings,
with a net positive effect on the loan-granting algorithm’s decision.
Example 2: Consider now another setting of Figure 1 where an
agricultural team wishes to increase the yield of their rice paddy.
While many factors influence yield =ℎ(temperature, solar radiation,
water supply, seed quality, ...), the primary actionable capacity of
the team is their choice of paddy location. Importantly, the altitude
at which the paddy sits has an effect on other variables. For example,
the laws of physics may imply that a 100𝑚 increase in elevation
results in a 1°C decrease in temperature on average. Therefore,
it is conceivable that a counterfactual explanation suggesting an
increase in elevation for optimal yield, without consideration for
downstream effects of the elevation increase on other variables,
may actually result in the prediction not changing.
The two examples above illustrate the pitfalls of generating re-
course actions directly from counterfactual explanations without
consideration for the structure of the world in which the actions will
be performed. Actions derived directly from counterfactual expla-
nations may ask too much effort from the individual (Example 1)
or may not even result in the desired output (Example 2).
In this paper, we remedy this situation via a fundamental re-
formulation of the recourse problem, where we rely on causal
reasoning to incorporate knowledge of causal dependencies into
the process of recommending recourse actions, that if acted upon
would result in a counterfactual instance that favourably changes
the output of the predictive model. In more detail, we first provide a
causal analysis to illuminate the intrinsic limitations of the setting
in which actions directly follow counterfactual explanations. Impor-
tantly, we show that even when equipped with knowledge of causal
dependencies after-the-fact, the actions derived from pre-computed
(nearest) counterfactual explanations may prove sub-optimal, or
directly, unfeasible. Second, to address the above limitations, we
emphasize that, from a causal perspective, actions correspond to
interventions which not only model the change in the intervened-
upon variable, but also the downstream effects of this intervention
on the rest of the (non-intervened-upon) variables. This insight
allows us to propose a recourse through minimal interventions prob-
lem, whose solution informs stakeholders on how to act in addition
to understand. We complement this result with a commentary on
the form of interventions, and with a more general definition of
feasibility beyond actionability. Finally, we provide a detailed dis-
cussion on both the importance and the practical limitations of
incorporating causal reasoning in the formulation of recourse.
2 ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE VIA
COUNTERFACTUAL EXPLANATIONS
Counterfactual explanations (CFE) are statements of “how the world
would have (had) to be different for a desirable outcome to occur”
[52]. In the context of explainable machine learning, the literature
has focused on finding nearest counterfactual explanations (i.e., in-
stances),
1
which result in the desired prediction while incurring
the smallest change to the individual’s feature vector, as measured
by a context-dependent dissimilarity metric, dist : X × X → R+.
This problem has been formulated as the following optimization
problem [52]:
𝒙*CFE ∈ 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝒙
dist(𝒙, 𝒙F) s.t. ℎ(𝒙) ≠ ℎ(𝒙F), 𝒙 ∈ P,
(1)
where 𝒙F ∈ X is the factual instance; 𝒙*CFE ∈ X is a (perhaps
not unique) nearest counterfactual instance; ℎ is the fixed binary
predictor; and P is an optional set of plausibility constraints, e.g.,
the counterfactual instance be from a relatively high-density region
of the input space [17, 38].
Most of the existing approaches in the counterfactual expla-
nations literature have focused on providing solutions to the op-
timization problem in (1), by exploring semantically meaningful
distance/dissimilarity functions dist(·, ·) between individuals (e.g.,
ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓ∞, percentile-shift), accommodating different predictive mod-
elsℎ (e.g., random forest, multilayer perceptron), and realistic plausi-
bility constraints,P. In particular, [6, 31, 52] solve (1) using gradient-
based optimization; [43, 49] employ mixed-integer linear program
solvers to support mixed numeric/binary data; [38] use graph-based
shortest path algorithms; [26] use a heuristic search procedure by
growing spheres around the factual instance; [13, 45] build on ge-
netic algorithms for model-agnostic behavior; and [18] solve (1)
using satisfiability solvers with closeness guarantees.
Although nearest counterfactual explanations provide an under-
standing of the most similar set of features that result in the desired
prediction, they stop short of giving explicit recommendations on
how to act to realize this set of features. The lack of specification of
the actions required to realize 𝒙*CFE from 𝒙F leads to uncertainty
and limited agency for the individual seeking recourse. To shift
the focus from explaining a decision to providing recommendable
actions to achieve recourse, Ustun et al. [49] reformulated (1) as:
𝜹∗ ∈ 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝜹
cost(𝜹 ; 𝒙F) s.t. ℎ(𝒙CFE) ≠ ℎ(𝒙F),
𝒙CFE = 𝒙F + 𝜹,
𝒙CFE ∈ P, 𝜹 ∈ F ,
(2)
where cost(·; 𝒙F) : X × X → R+ is a user-specified cost that en-
codes preferences between feasible actions from 𝒙F, and F and
P are optional sets of feasibility and plausibility constraints,

Here, “feasible” means possible to do, whereas “plausible” means possibly true, believ-
able or realistic. Optimization terminology refers to both as feasibility sets.

respectively. The feasibility constraints in (2), as introduced in [49],
aim at restricting the set of features that the individual may act
upon. For instance, recommendations should not ask individuals to
change their gender or reduce their age. Henceforth, we refer to
the optimization problem in (2) as the CFE-based recourse problem.
3 A CAUSAL PERSPECTIVE OF
ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE
The seemingly innocent reformulation of the counterfactual expla-
nation problem in (1) as a recourse problem in (2) is founded on
two assumptions:
Assumption 1: the feature-wise difference between factual and
nearest counterfactual instances, 𝜹∗ = 𝒙*CFE−𝒙F, directly translates
to the minimal action set, ACFE
, such that performing the actions
in ACFE
starting from 𝒙F will result in 𝒙*CFE; and
Assumption 2: there is a 1-1mapping between dist(·, ·) and cost(·; ·),
whereby larger actions incur larger distance and higher cost.
Unfortunately, these assumptions only hold in restrictive set-
tings, rendering the solution of (2) sub-optimal or infeasible in many
real-world scenarios. Specifically, Assumption 1 holds only if (i)
the individual applies effort in a world where changing a variable
does not have downstream other variables (i.e., features are indepen-
dent from each other); or if (ii) the individual changes the value of
a subset of variables while simultaneously enforcing that the value
of all other variables remain unchanged (i.e., breaking dependen-
cies between features). Beyond the sub-optimality that arises from
assuming/reducing to an independent world in (i), and disregarding
the feasibility of non-altering actions in (ii), non-altering actions
may naturally incur a cost which is not captured in the current
definition of cost, and hence Assumption 2 does not hold either.
Therefore, except in trivial cases where the model designer actively
inputs pair-wise independent features to ℎ, generating recommen-
dations from counterfactual explanations in this manner, i.e., ignor-
ing the dependencies between features, warrants reconsideration.
Next, we formalize these shortcomings using causal reasoning.
3.1 Actions as Interventions
Let M ∈ Π denote the structural causal model (SCM) capturing all
inter-variable causal dependencies in the real world.M = ⟨F,X,U⟩
is characterized by the endogenous (observed) variables, X ∈ X,
the exogenous variables, U ∈ U, and a sequence of structural
equations F : U → X, describing how endogenous variables can be
(deterministically) obtained from the exogenous variables [34, 46].
Often, M is illustrated using a directed graphical model, G (see,
e.g., Figure 1).
From a causal perspective, actions may be carried out via struc-
tural interventions, A : Π → Π, which can be thought of as a trans-
formation between SCMs [33, 34]. A set of interventions can be
constructed as A = do({X𝑖 B 𝑎𝑖 }𝑖∈𝐼 ) where 𝐼 contains the indices
of the subset of endogenous variables to be intervened upon. In
this case, for each 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 , the do-operator replaces the structural
equation for the 𝑖-th endogenous variable X𝑖 in F with X𝑖 B 𝑎𝑖 .
Correspondingly, graph surgery is performed on G, severing graph
edges incident on an intervened variable, X𝑖 . Thus, performing
the actions A in a world M yields the post-intervention world

on X2 result in different post-intervention models: M1 =
MA={do(X1B𝑎1) } corresponds to interventions only on X1
with consequential effects on X2; M2 = MA={do(X2B𝑎2) }
shows the result of structural interventions only on X2
which in turn dismisses ancestral effects on this variable;
and, M3 = MA={do(X1B𝑎1,X2B𝑎2) } is the resulting (indepen-
dent world) model after intervening on both variables, i.e.,
the type of interventions generally assumed in the CFE-
based recourse problem.
modelMA with structural equations FA = {𝐹𝑖 } 𝑖∉𝐼 ∪ {X𝑖 B 𝑎𝑖 }𝑖∈𝐼 .
Structural interventions are illustrated in Figure 2.
Structural interventions are used to predict the effect of actions on
the world as a whole (i.e., how M becomes MA). In the context of
recourse, we aim to model the effect of actions on one individual’s
situation (i.e., how 𝒙F becomes 𝒙SCF) to ascertain whether or not the
desirable outcome is achieved (i.e., ℎ(𝒙F) ≠ ℎ(𝒙SCF)). We compute
individual-level effects using structural counterfactuals [36].
Assuming causal sufficiency of M (i.e., no hidden confounders),
and full specification of an invertible F (such that F(F−1 (𝒙)) = 𝒙),
X can be uniquely determined given the value ofU (and vice-versa).
Hence, one can determine the distinct values of exogenous variables
that give rise to a particular realization of the endogenous variables,
{X𝑖 = 𝑥F
𝑖
}𝑖 ⊆ X, as F−1 (𝒙F) [36].3 As a result, we can compute
any structural counterfactual query 𝒙SCF for an individual 𝒙F as
𝒙SCF = FA (F−1 (𝒙F)). In our context, that is: “if an individual 𝒙F
observed in world M performs the set of actions A, what will be
the resulting individual’s feature vector 𝒙SCF”.4
3.2 Limitations of CFE-based recourse
Next, we use causal reasoning to formalize the limitations of the
CFE-based recourse approach in (2). To this end, we first reinterpret
the actions resulting from solving the CFE-based recourse problem,
i.e., 𝜹∗, as structural interventions by defining the set of indices
of observed variables that are intervened upon, 𝐼 . We remark that,
given 𝜹∗, an individual seeking recourse may intervene on any
arbitrary subset of observed variables 𝐼 , as long as the intervention
contains the variable indices for which 𝛿∗
𝑖
≠ 0. Now, we are in a
position to define CFE-based actions as interventions, i.e.,
3
For notational simplicity, we interchangeably use sets and vectors, e.g., {X𝑖 = 𝑥F
𝑖 }𝑖 ⊆
X and 𝒙F ∈ X.
4
Queries such as this subsume both retrospective/subjunctive/counterfactual (“what
would have been the value of”) and prospective/indicative/predictive (“what will be the
value of”) conditionals [11, 25, 48], as long as we assume that the laws governing the
world, F, are stationary.

Definition 3.1 (CFE-based actions). Given an individual 𝒙F in
world M, the solution of (2), 𝜹∗, and the set of indices of observed
variables that are acted upon, 𝐼 , a CFE-based action refers to a set of
structural interventions of the formACFE
:= do({X𝑖 B 𝑥𝐹
𝑖
+𝛿∗
𝑖
}𝑖∈𝐼 ).
Using Definition 3.1, we can derive the following key results that
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for CFE-based actions
to guarantee recourse.
Proposition 3.1. A CFE-based action, ACFE, where 𝐼 = {𝑖 | 𝛿∗
𝑖
≠ 0},
performed by individual 𝒙F, in general results in the structural coun-
terfactual, 𝒙SCF = 𝒙*CFE := 𝒙F + 𝜹∗, and thus guarantees recourse
(i.e., ℎ(𝒙SCF) ≠ ℎ(𝒙F)), if and only if, the set of descendants of the
acted upon variables, determined by 𝐼 , is the empty set.
Corollary 3.1. If the true world M is independent, i.e, all the ob-
served features are root-nodes, then CFE-based actions always guar-
antee recourse.
While the above results are formally proven in Appendix A,
we provide a sketch of the proof below. If the intervened-upon
variables do not have descendants, then by definition 𝒙SCF = 𝒙*CFE.
Otherwise, the value of the descendants will depend on the coun-
terfactual value of their parents, leading to a structural counterfac-
tual that does not resemble the nearest counterfactual explanation,
𝒙SCF ≠ 𝒙*CFE, and thus may not result in recourse. Moreover, in an
independent world the set of descendants of all the variables is by
definition the empty set.
Unfortunately, the independent world assumption is not realistic,
as it requires all the features selected to train the predictive model
ℎ to be independent of each other. Moreover, limiting changes to
only those variables without descendants may unnecessarily limit
the agency of the individual, e.g., in Example 1, restricting the
individual to only changing bank balance without e.g., pursuing
a new/side job to increase their income would be limiting. Thus,
for a given non-independentM capturing the true causal depen-
dencies between features, CFE-based actions require the individual
seeking recourse to enforce (at least partially) an independent post-
intervention modelMACFE (so that Assumption 1 holds), by inter-
vening on all the observed variables for which 𝛿𝑖 ≠ 0 as well as on
their descendants (even if their 𝛿𝑖 = 0). However, such requirement
suffers from two main issues. First, it conflicts withAssumption 2,
since holding the value of variables may still imply potentially in-
feasible and costly interventions in M to sever all the incoming
edges to such variables, and even then it may not change the predic-
tion (see Example 2). Second, as will be proven in the next section
(see also, Example 1), CFE-based actions may still be suboptimal,
as they do not benefit from the causal effect of actions towards
changing the prediction. Thus, even when equipped with knowl-
edge of causal dependencies, recommending actions directly from
counterfactual explanations in the manner of existing approaches
is not satisfactory.

recourse problem so that instead of finding the minimal (indepen-
dent) shift of features as in (2), we seek the minimal cost set of
actions (in the form of structural interventions) that results in a
counterfactual instance yielding the favourable output from ℎ:
A∗ ∈ 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛
A
cost(A; 𝒙F)
s.t. ℎ(𝒙SCF) ≠ ℎ(𝒙F)
𝒙SCF = FA (F−1 (𝒙F))
𝒙SCF ∈ P, A ∈ F ,
(3)
where A∗ ∈ F directly specifies the set of feasible actions to be per-
formed forminimally costly recourse, with cost(·; 𝒙F) : F × X → R+,
and 𝒙*SCF = FA∗ (F−1 (𝒙F)) denotes the resulting structural counter-
factual. We recall that, although 𝒙*SCF is a counterfactual instance,
it does not need to correspond to the nearest counterfactual expla-
nation, 𝒙*CFE, resulting from (2) (see, e.g., Example 1). Importantly,
using the formulation in (3) it is now straightforward to show the
suboptimality of CFE-based actions, as shown next (proof in Ap-
pendix A):
Proposition 4.1. Given an individual 𝒙F observed in worldM ∈ Π,
a family of feasible actions F , and the solution of (3), A∗ ∈ F .
Assume that there exists CFE-based action ACFE ∈ F that achieves re-
course, i.e., ℎ(𝒙F) ≠ ℎ(𝒙*CFE). Then, cost(A∗
; 𝒙F) ≤ cost(ACFE
; 𝒙F).
Thus, for a known causal model capturing the dependencies
among observed variables, and a family of feasible interventions,
the optimization problem in (3) yields Recourse through Minimal
Interventions (MINT). Generating minimal interventions through
solving (3) requires that we be able to compute the structural coun-
terfactual, 𝒙SCF, of the individual 𝒙F in worldM, given any feasible
action,A. To this end, we consider that the SCMM falls in the class
of additive noise models (ANM), so that we can deterministically
compute the counterfactual 𝒙SCF = FA (F−1 (𝒙F)) by performing
the Abduction-Action-Prediction steps proposed by Pearl et al. [36].
4.1 Working example
Consider the model in Figure 3, where {U𝑖 }4𝑖=1 are mutually inde-
pendent exogenous variables, and {𝑓𝑖 }4𝑖=1 are structural (linear or
nonlinear) equations. Let 𝒙F = [𝑥F

features belonging to the (factual) individual, for whom we seek
a counterfactual explanation and recommendation. Also, let 𝐼 de-
note the set of indices corresponding to the subset of endogenous
variables that are intervened upon according to the action set A.

Then, we obtain a structural counterfactual, 𝒙SCF = FA (F−1 (𝒙F)),
by applying the Abduction-Action-Prediction steps [35] as follows:
Step 1. Abduction uniquely determines the value of all exoge-
nous variables, {𝑢𝑖 }4𝑖=1, given evidence, {X𝑖 = 𝑥F

}4

𝑢1 = 𝑥F

− 𝑓4 (𝑥F3 ).
(4)
Step 2. Action modifies the SCM according to the hypothetical
interventions, do({X𝑖 B 𝑎𝑖 }𝑖∈𝐼 ) (where 𝑎𝑖 = 𝑥𝐹
𝑖
+ 𝛿𝑖 ), yielding FA:
X1 B [1 ∈ 𝐼 ] · 𝑎1 + [1 ∉ 𝐼 ] · U1,
X2 B [2 ∈ 𝐼 ] · 𝑎2 + [2 ∉ 𝐼 ] · U2,
X3 B [3 ∈ 𝐼 ] · 𝑎3 + [3 ∉ 𝐼 ] ·
(

,
X4 B [4 ∈ 𝐼 ] · 𝑎4 + [4 ∉ 𝐼 ] ·
(
𝑓4 (X3) + U4

,
(5)
where [·] denotes the Iverson bracket.
Step 3. Prediction recursively determines the values of all en-
dogenous variables based on the computed exogenous variables
{𝑢𝑖 }4𝑖=1 from Step 1 and FA from Step 2, as:
𝑥SCF

B [1 ∈ 𝐼 ] · 𝑎1 + [1 ∉ 𝐼 ] ·

4.2 General assignment formulation
As we have not made any restricting assumptions about the struc-
tural equations (only that we operate with additive noise mod-
els
5
where noise variables are pairwise independent), the solution
for the working example naturally generalizes to SCMs correspond-
ing to other DAGswithmore variables. The assignment of structural
counterfactual values can generally be written as:
𝑥SCF𝑖 = [𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ] · (𝑥F𝑖 + 𝛿𝑖 )
+ [𝑖 ∉ 𝐼 ] ·
(
𝑥F𝑖 + 𝑓𝑖 (paSCF𝑖 ) − 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 )
)
.
(7)
In words, the counterfactual value of the 𝑖-th feature, 𝑥SCF
𝑖
, takes
the value 𝑥F
𝑖
+ 𝛿𝑖 if such feature is intervened upon (i.e., 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ).
Otherwise, 𝑥SCF
𝑖
is computed as a function of both the factual and
counterfactual values of its parents, denoted respectively by 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 )
and 𝑓𝑖 (paSCF𝑖
). The closed-form expression in (7) can replace the
counterfactual constraint in (3), i.e., 𝒙SCF = FA (F−1 (𝒙F)), after
which the optimization problem may be solved by building on exist-
ing frameworks for generating nearest counterfactual explanations,
including gradient-based, evolutionary-based, heuristics-based, or
verification-based approaches as referenced in Section 2. While out

We remark that the presented formulation also holds for more general SCMs (for
example where the exogenous variable contribution is not additive) as long as the
sequence of structural equations F is invertible, i.e., there exists a sequence of equations
F−1 such that 𝒙 = F(F−1 (𝒙)) (in other words, the exogenous variables are uniquely
identifiable via the abduction step).
we extended the open-source code of MACE [18]; we will submit a
pull-request to the respective repository.
4.3 Demonstration
We showcase our proposed formulation by comparing the actions
recommended by existing (nearest) counterfactual explanation
methods, as in (2), to the ones generated by the proposed mini-
mal intervention formulation in (3). We recall that prior literature
has focused on generating counterfactual explanations or CFE-
based actions, which as shown above lack optimally or feasibility
guarantees in non-independent worlds. Thus, to the best of our
knowledge, there exists no baseline approach in the literature that
guarantees algorithmic recourse. The experiments below serve as
an illustration of the sub-optimality of existing approaches relative
to our proposed formulation of recourse via minimal intervention.
Section 6 presents a detailed discussion on practical considerations.
We consider two settings: i) a synthetic setting whereM follows
Figure 1; and ii) a real-world setting based on the german credit
dataset [1], where M follows Figure 3. We computed the cost of
actions as the ℓ1 norm over normalized feature changes to make
effort comparable across features, i.e., cost(·; 𝒙F) =
∑
𝑖∈𝐼 |𝛿𝑖 |/𝑅𝑖 ,
where 𝑅𝑖 is the range of feature 𝑖 .
For the synthetic setting, we generate data following the model
in Figure 1, where we assume X1 B U1, X2 B 3/10 · X1 + U2,
with U1 ∼ $10000 · Poission(10) and U2 ∼ $2500 · N (0, 1); and
the predictive model ℎ = sgn(X1 + 5 · X2 − $225000). Given 𝒙F =
[$75000, $25000]𝑇 , solving our formulation, (3), identifies the op-
timal action set A∗ = do(X1 B 𝑥F
1
+ $10000) which results in
𝒙*SCF = FA∗ (F−1 (𝒙F)) = [$85000, $28000]𝑇 , whereas solving pre-
vious formulations, (2), yields 𝜹∗ = [$0, +$5000]𝑇 resulting in
𝒙*CFE = 𝒙F + 𝜹∗ = [$75000, $30000]𝑇 . Importantly, while 𝒙*SCF
appears to be at a further distance from 𝒙F compared to 𝒙*CFE,
achieving the former is less costly than the latter, specifically,
cost(𝜹∗; 𝒙F) ≈ 2 cost(A∗
; 𝒙F).
As a real-world setting, we consider a subset of the features
in the german credit dataset. The setup is depicted in Figure 3,
where X1 is the individual’s gender (treated as immutable), X2 is
the individual’s age (actionable but can only increase), X3 is credit
given by the bank (actionable), X4 is the repayment duration of the
credit (non-actionable but mutable), and Ŷ is the predicted customer
risk, according to ℎ (logisitic regression or decision tree). We learn
the structural equations by fitting a linear regression model to the
child-parent tuples. We will release the data, and the code used to
learn models and structural equations.
Given the setup above, for instance, for the individual 𝒙F =
[Male, 32, $1938, 24]𝑇 identified as a risky customer, solving our
formulation, (3), yields the optimal action set A∗ = do({X2 B
𝑥F
2
+ 1,X3 B 𝑥F
3
− $800}) which results in 𝒙*SCF = FA∗ (F−1 (𝒙F)) =
[Male, 33, $1138, 22]𝑇 , whereas solving (2) yields𝜹∗ = [N/A, +6, 0, 0]𝑇
resulting in 𝒙*CFE = 𝒙F + 𝜹∗ = [Male, 38, $1938, 24]𝑇 . Similar to the
toy setting, we observe a %42 decrease in effort required of the indi-
vidual when using the action by our method, since our cost function
states that waiting for six years to get the credit approved is more
costly than applying the following year for a lower (−$800) credit
amount. We extend our analysis to a population level, and observe
that for 50 negatively affected test individuals, previous approaches
357
FAccT ’21, March 1–4, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada Karimi, Schölkopf, Valera
suggest actions that are on average %39 ± %24 and %65 ± %8 more
costly than our approach when considering, respectively, a logistic
regression and a decision tree as the predictive model ℎ.
The demonstrations above confirm our theoretical analysis that
MINT-based actions from (3) are less costly and thusmore beneficial
for affected individuals than existing CFE-based actions from (2)
that fail to utilize the causal relations between variables.
5 TOWARDS REALISTIC INTERVENTIONS
In Section 4, we formulated algorithmic recourse by considering
the causal relations between features in the real world. Our for-
mulation minimized the cost of actions, which were carried out
as structural interventions on the corresponding graph. Each in-
tervention proceeds by unconditionally severing all edges incident
on the intervened node, fixing the post-manipulation distribution
of a single variable to one deterministic value. While intuitive ap-
pealing and powerful, structural interventions are in many ways
the simplest type of interventions, and their “simplicity comes at a
price: foregoing the possibility of modeling many situations real-
isitically” [8, 22]. Below, we extend (3) and (7) to add flexibility and
realism to the types of interventions performed by the individual.
Notably, there is nothing inherent to an SCM that a priori deter-
mines the form, feasibility, or scope of intervention; instead, these
choices are delegated to the individual and are made based on a
semantic understanding of the modeled variables.
5.1 On the Form of Interventions
The demonstrations in Section 4.3 primarily focused on actions
performed as structural (a.k.a., hard) interventions [34] where all
incoming edges to the intervened node are severed (see (7)). Hard
interventions are particularly useful for Randomized Control Trial
(RCT) settings where one aims to evaluate (isolate) the causal effect
of an action (e.g., effect of aspirin on patients with migraine) on the
population by randomly assigning individuals to treatment/control
groups, removing the influence of other factors (e.g., age).
In the context of algorithmic recourse, however, an individual
performs actions in the real world, and therefore must play the rules
governing the world. In earlier sections, these rules (captured in an
SCM) guided the search for an optimal set of actions by modelling
actions along with their consequences. The rules also determine the
form of an intervention, e.g., specifying whether an intervention
cancels out or complements existing causal relations.
For instance, consider Example 1, where an individual chooses
to increase their bank balance (e.g., through borrowing money from
family, i.e., a deliberate action/intervention on X2 while continuing
to put aside a portion of their income (i.e., retaining the relation
X2 B 3/10 · X1 + U2). Indeed, it would be unwise for a recommen-
dation to suggest abandoning saving habits. In such a scenario, the
action would be carried out as an additive (a.k.a., soft) interven-
tion [10]. Such interventions do not sever graphical edges incident
on the intervened node and continue to allow for parents of the
node to affect that node. Conversely, in Example 2, recourse rec-
ommendations may suggest performing a structural intervention
on temperature, e.g., by creating a climate controlled green-house,
to cancel the natural effect of altitude change on temperature.
The previous examples illustrate a scenario where an individu-
al/agriculture team actually have the agency to choose which type
of intervention to perform. However, it is easy to conceive of ex-
amples where such an option does not exist. For instance, as part
of a medical system’s recommendation, we might consider adding
5 mg/l of insulin to a patient with diabetes with a certain blood in-
sulin level [36]. This action cannot disable pre-existing mechanisms
regulating blood insulin levels and therefore, the action can only be
performed additively. Conversely, one may also consider another
example from the medical domain whereby the only treatment of
malignancy may be through a surgical (structural) amputation.
6
Just as structural interventions were supported in our framework
via a closed-form expression (see (7)), additive interventions can be
encoded through an analogous assignment formulation:
𝑥SCF𝑖 = [𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ] · 𝛿𝑖 +
(
𝑥F𝑖 + 𝑓𝑖 (paSCF𝑖 ) − 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 )
)
. (8)
The choice of whether interventions should be applied in a addi-
tive/soft or structural/hard manner depends on the variable seman-
tic [3], and should be decided prior to solving (3).
5.2 On the Feasibility of Interventions
We saw in Section 3 that earlier works motivated the addition
of feasibility constraints as a means to provide more actionable
recommendations for the individual seeking recourse [49]. There,
the actionability (a.k.a. mutability) of a feature was determined
based on the feature semantic and value in the factual instance,
marking those features which the individual has/lacks the agency
to change (e.g., bank balance vs. race). While the interchangeable
use of definition holds under an independent world, it fails when
operating in most real-world settings governed by a set of causal
dependencies. We study this subtlety below.
In an independent world, any change to variable X𝑖 could come
about only via an intervention on X𝑖 itself. Therefore, immutable
and non-actionable variables overlap. In a dependent world, how-
ever, changes to variable X𝑖 may arise from an intervention on
X𝑖 or through changes to any of the ancestors of X𝑖 . In this more
general setting, we can tease apart the definition of actionability
and mutability, and distinguish between three types of variables: (i)
immutable (and hence non-actionable), e.g., race; (ii) mutable but
non-actionable, e.g., credit score; and (iii) actionable (and hence mu-
table), e.g., bank balance. Each type requires special consideration
which we show can be intuitively encoded as constraints amended
to A ∈ F from (3).
Immutable:We posit that the set of immutable (and hence non-
actionable) variables should be closed under ancestral relationships
given by the model,M. This condition parallels the ancestral clo-
sure of protected attributions in [23]. This would ensure that under
no circumstance would an intervention on an ancestor of an im-
mutable variable change the immutable variable. Therefore, for an
immutable variable X𝑖 , the constraint [𝑖 ∉ 𝐼 ] = 1 recursively neces-
sitates the fulfillment of additional constraints [ 𝑗 ∉ 𝐼 ] = 1 ∀ 𝑗 ∈ pa𝑖
in F . For instance, the immutability of race triggers the immutabil-
ity of birthplace.
Mutable but non-actionable: To encode the conditions for
mutable but non-actionable variables, we note that while a variable

358
Algorithmic Recourse:
from Counterfactual Explanations to Interventions FAccT ’21, March 1–4, 2021, Virtual Event, Canada
may not be directly actionable, it may still change as a result of
changes to its parents. For example, the financial credit score in
Figure 3 may change as a result of interventions to salary or savings,
but is not itself directly intervenable. Therefore, for a non-actionable
but mutable variable X𝑖 , the constraint [𝑖 ∉ 𝐼 ] = 1 is sufficient and
does not induce any other constraints.
Actionable: In the most general sense, the actionable feasibility
of an intervention on X𝑖 may be contingent on a number of condi-
tions, as follows: (a) the pre-intervention value of the intervened
variable (i.e., 𝑥F
𝑖
); (b) the pre-intervention value of other variables
(i.e., {𝑥F
𝑗
} 𝑗⊂[𝑑 ]\𝑖 ); (c) the post-intervention value of the intervened
variable (i.e., 𝑥SCF
𝑖
); and (d) the post-intervention value of other
variables (i.e., {𝑥SCF
𝑗
} 𝑗⊂[𝑑 ]\𝑖 ). Such feasibility conditions can easily
be encoded into F ; consider the following scenarios:
(a) an individual’s age can only increase, i.e., [𝑥SCF𝑎𝑔𝑒 ≥ 𝑥F𝑎𝑔𝑒 ]; (b)
an individual cannot apply for credit on a temporary visa, i.e.,
[𝑥F
𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑎
= PERMANENT] ≥ [𝑥SCF
𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡
= TRUE];
(c) an individual may undergo heart surgery (an additive inter-
vention) only if they won’t remiss due to sustained smoking habits,
i.e., [𝑥SCF
ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡
≠ REMISSION]; and
(d) an individual may undergo heart surgery only after their
blood pressure is regularized due to medicinal intervention, i.e.,
[𝑥SCF
𝑏𝑝
= O.K.] ≥ [𝑥SCF
ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡
= SURGERY].
In summary, while previous works on algorithmic recourse dis-
tinguished between actionable, conditionally actionable,
7
and im-
mutable variables [49], we can now operate on a more realistic
spectrum of variables, ranging from conditionally soft/hard action-
able, to non-actionable but mutable, and finally to immutable and
non-actionable variables. Finally, we remind that feasibility is a
distinct notion from plausibility; whereas the former restricts ac-
tions A ∈ F to those that can be performed by the individual,
the latter determines the likeliness of the counterfactual instance
𝒙SCF = FA (F−1 (𝒙F)) ∈ P resulting from those actions. For instance,
building on the earlier example, although an individual with simi-
lar attributes and higher credit score may exist in the dataset (i.e.,
plausible), directly acting on credit score is not feasible.
5.3 On the Scope of Interventions
One final assumption has been made throughout our discussion of
actions as interventions which pertain to the one-to-one mapping
between an action in the real world and an intervention on a endoge-
nous variable in the structural causal model (which in turn are also
input features to the predictive model). As exemplified in [3], it is
possible for some actions (e.g., finding a higher-paying job) to simul-
taneously intervene on multiple variables in the model (e.g., income
and length of employment). Alternatively, for Example 2, choosing
a new paddy location is equivalent to intervening jointly on several
input features of the predictive model (e.g., altitude, radiation, pre-
cipitation). Such confounded/correlated interventions, referred to
as fat-hand/non-atomic interventions [10], will be explored further
in follow-up work, by modelling the world at different causally
consistent levels [4, 40].
7
Ustun et al. [49] also support conditionally actionable features (e.g., age or educational
degree) with conditions derived only from 𝑥F
𝑖 as in (a). We generalize the set of
conditions to support actions conditioned on the value of other variables as in (b),
additive interventions in (c), and sequential interventions as in (d).
6 DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have focused on the problem of algorithmic re-
course, i.e., the process by which an individual can change their
situation to obtain a desired outcome from a machine learning
model. First, using the tools from causal reasoning (i.e., structural
interventions and counterfactuals), we have shown that in their
current form, counterfactual explanations only bring about agency
for the individual to achieve recourse in unrealistic settings. In
other words, counterfactual explanations do not translate to an
optimal or feasible set of actions that would favourably change the
prediction of ℎ if acted upon. This shortcoming is primarily due to
the lack of consideration of causal relations governing the world
and thus, the failure to model the downstream effect of actions
in the predictions of the machine learning model. In other words,
although “counterfactual” is a term from causal language, we ob-
served that existing approaches fall short in terms of taking causal
reasoning into account when generating counterfactual explana-
tions and the subsequent recourse actions. Thus, building on the
statement by Wachter et al. [52] that counterfactual explanations
“do not rely on knowledge of the causal structure of the world,”
it is perhaps more appropriate to refer to existing approaches as
contrastive, rather than counterfactual, explanations [6, 30].
To directly take causal consequences of actions into account,
we have proposed a fundamental reformulation of the recourse
problem, where actions are performed as interventions and we seek
to minimize the cost of performing actions in a world governed by
a set of (physical) laws captured in a structural causal model. Our
proposed formulation in (3), complemented with several examples
and a detailed discussion, allows for recourse through minimal in-
terventions (MINT), that when performed will result in a structural
counterfactual that favourably changes the output of the model.
Next, we discuss the work most closely related to ours, the main
limitation of the proposed recourse approach, and propose future
venues for research to address such shortcomings.
Relatedwork. Anumber of authors have argued for the need to
consider causal relations between variables [18, 31, 49, 52], generally
based on the intuition that changing some variables may have
effects on others. In the original counterfactual explanations work,
Wachter et al. [52] also suggest that “counterfactuals generated
from an accurate causal model may ultimately be of use to experts
(e.g., to medical professionals trying to decide which intervention
will move a patient out of an at-risk group)”. Despite this general
agreement, to the best of our knowledge, only two works have
attempted to technically formulate this requirement.
In the first work, Joshi et al. [17] study recourse in causal models
under confounders and with predetermined treatment variables. In
this work, a distribution over hidden confounders is first estimated
along with a mapping from the attributes 𝒙 to hidden confounders,
i.e., 𝐺−1
\
(𝒙) = 𝒛. Then, under each intervention on treatment vari-
ables, explanations are generated following (1) with the plausibility
term constraining the inverse of the counterfactual instance (i.e.,
𝐺−1
\
(𝒙)) to the approximated confounding distribution. In this work,
we instead optimize for recourse actions rather than counterfactual
instances that result from those action.
In the second work, Mahajan et al. [28] present a modified ver-
sion of the distance function in (1), amending the standard proximity
359

loss between factual and counterfactual instances with a causal reg-
ularizer to encourage the counterfactual value of each endogenous
variable to be close to the value of that variable had it been assigned
via its structural equation. Beyond the uncertainty regarding the
strength of regularization (which would mean causal relations may
not be guaranteed), and why the standard proximity loss only iter-
ates over the exogenous variables (which from a causal perspective,
are characteristics that are shared across counterfactual worlds [23,
footnote 4]), this approach suffers from a primary limitation in its
causal treatment: the causal regularizer would penalize any variable
whose value deviated away from its structurally assigned value.
While on the surface this “preservation of causal relations” seems
beneficial, such an approach would discourage interventions (addi-
tive or structural) on non-root variables, which would, by design,
change the value of the intervened-upon variable away from its
structurally assigned value. Instead, the regularizer would encour-
age interventions on variables that would not be penalized as such,
i.e., root variables, which may not be contextually acceptable as
root notes typically capture sensitive characteristic of the individual
(e.g., birthplace, age, gender). The authors suggest (in the Appen-
dix of [28]) that one may consider those variables, upon which
(structural) interventions are to be performed, as exogenous. In this
manner, interventions would not be penalized and down-stream
effects of interventions would still be preserved when searching for
the nearest counterfactual instance. We argue, however, that such
an approach suffers from the same limitations as other CFE-based
recourse approaches presented in Section 3.2 in that a returned
counterfactual instance would not imply feasible or optimal actions
for recourse. Finally, without an explicit abduction step and without
assumptions on the form of structural equations, it is unclear how
the authors infer and combine individual-specific characteristics (as
embedded in the background variables) with the effect of ancestral
changes to compute the counterfactual. We believe the problems
above will be mostly resolved when minimizing over the cost of
actions instead of distance over counterfactuals as we have done in
this work.
Practical limitations. The primary limitation of our formula-
tion in (3) is its reliance on the true causal model of the world,
subsuming both the graph, and the structural equations. In practice,
the underlying causal model is rarely known, which suggests that
the counterfactual constraint in (3), i.e., 𝒙SCF = FA (F−1 (𝒙F)), may
not be (deterministically) identifiable. We believe this is a valid criti-
cism, not just of our work, but of any approach suggesting actions to
be performed in the real world for consequential decision-making.
Importantly, beyond recourse, the community on algorithmic fair-
ness has echoed the need for causal counterfactual analysis for fair
predictions, and have also voiced their concern about untestable
assumptions when the true SCM is not available [2, 5, 19, 23, 44].
Perhaps more concerningly, our work highlights the implicit
causal assumptions made by existing approaches (i.e., that of in-
dependence, or feasible and cost-free interventions), which may
portray a false sense of recourse guarantees where one does not
exists (see Example 2 and all of Section 3.2). Our work aims to
highlight existing imperfect assumptions, and to offer an alterna-
tive formulation, backed with proofs and demonstrations, which
would guarantee recourse if assumptions about the causal structure
of the world were satisfied. Future research on causal algorithmic
recourse may benefit from the rich literature in causality that has
developed methods to verify and perform inference under various
assumptions [37]. Thus, we consider further discussion on causal
identifiability to be out of scope of this paper, as it remains as an
open and key question in the Ethical ML community.
This is not to say that counterfactual explanations should be
abandoned altogether. On the contrary, we believe the counterfac-
tual explanations hold promise for “guided audit of the data” [52]
and evaluating various desirable model properties, such as robust-
ness [16, 45] or fairness [15, 18, 45, 49]. Besides this, it has been
shown that designers of interpretable machine learning systems
use counterfactual explanations for predicting model behavior [24]
or uncovering inaccuracies in the data profile of individuals [50].
Complementing these offerings of counterfactual explanations, we
offer minimal interventions as a way to guarantee algorithmic re-
course in general settings, which is not implied by counterfactual
explanations.
Future work. In future work, we aim to focus on overcoming
the main assumption of our formulation: the availability of the
true world model, M. An immediate first step involves learning
the true world model (partially or fully) [9, 12, 29], and studying
potential inefficiencies that may arise from partial or imperfect
knowledge of the causal model governing the world. Furthermore,
while additive noise models are a broadly used class of SCMs for
modeling real-world systems, further investigation into the effects
of confounders (non-independent noise variables), the presence of
only the causal graph, as well as cyclic graphical models for time
series data (e.g., conditional interventions), would extend the reach
of algorithmic recourse to even broader settings.
In Section 5, we presented feasibility constraints for a wide range
of settings, including dynamical settings in which one intervention
enables the preconditions of another. An interesting line of future
research would involve combining the causal intervention-based
recourse framework, as presented in our work, with multi-stage
planning strategies such as [39] to generate optimal sequential
actions.
Finally, the examples presented in relation to the form and feasi-
bility of intervention serve only to illustrate the flexibility of our
formulation in supporting a variety of real-world constraints. They
do not, however, aim to provide an authoritative definition of how to
interpret variables and the context- and individual-dependent con-
straints for recourse as highlighted by other works [3, 21]. Future
cross-disciplinary research would benefit from accurately defining
the variables and relationships and types of permissible interven-
tions in consequential decision-making settings. Relatedly, future
research would also benefit from a study of properties that cost
functions should satisfy (e.g., individual-based or population-based,
monotonicity) as the primary means to measure the effort endured
by the individual seeking recourse.

A PROOFS
A.1 Proof of Proposition 3.1
Proposition 3.1. A CFE-based action, ACFE, where 𝐼 = {𝑖 | 𝛿∗
𝑖
≠ 0},
performed by individual 𝒙F, in general results in the structural coun-
terfactual, 𝒙SCF = 𝒙*CFE := 𝒙F + 𝜹∗, and thus guarantees recourse
(i.e., ℎ(𝒙SCF) ≠ ℎ(𝒙F)), if and only if, the set of descendants of the
acted upon variables, determined by 𝐼 , is the empty set.
Proof. The setting assumes that the causal graph G is available
such that the parent set for each variable is known. Let d(𝑋 ) and
nd(𝑋 ) denote the sets of descendants and non-descendants of the
variable 𝑋 according to G, respectively. For multiple intervened-
upon variables, we define:
X𝐼 := {𝑋𝑖 }𝑖∈𝐼 ,
nd(X𝐼 ) := ∩𝑖∈𝐼 nd(𝑋𝑖 ),
d(X𝐼 ) := X \ (X𝐼 ∪ nd(X𝐼 )) .
Note that, by definition, X𝐼 , nd(X𝐼 ), and d(X𝐼 ) form a partition of
the set of all variables X.
To prove the iff conditional, we prove each direction separately.
For ease of exposition, we define
𝒙SCF = 𝒙*CFE := 𝒙F + 𝜹∗︸                         ︷︷                         ︸
p
⇐⇒ d(X𝐼 ) = ∅︸      ︷︷      ︸
q
where we recall the remark that given 𝜹∗, an individual seeking re-
course may intervene on any arbitrary subset of observed variables
X𝐼 , as long as (𝛿∗𝑖 ≠ 0) =⇒ (𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ).
q =⇒ p: Borrowing the closed-form expression of a structural
counterfactual from (??), we have
𝑥SCF𝑖 =
{
𝑥F
𝑖
+ 𝛿∗
𝑖
𝑖 ∈ 𝐼
𝑥F
𝑖
+ 𝑓𝑖 (paSCF𝑖
) − 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 ) 𝑖 ∉ 𝐼
(A.1)
which can be broken down further to specify the descendants and
non-descendants of intervened upon variables, as
𝑥SCF𝑖 =

𝑥F
𝑖
+ 𝛿∗
𝑖
𝑖 ∈ 𝐼
𝑥F
𝑖
+ 𝑓𝑖 (paSCF𝑖
) − 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 ) 𝑖 ∈ d(X𝐼 )
𝑥F
𝑖
+ 𝑓𝑖 (paSCF𝑖
) − 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 ) 𝑖 ∈ nd(X𝐼 )
(A.2)
By assumption, d(X𝐼 ) = ∅, so the second case never holds.
Furthermore, since structural interventions leave non-descendant
variables unaffected, we have that
paSCF𝑖 = paF𝑖 ∀𝑖 ∈ nd(X𝐼 ) .
Consequently,
𝑓𝑖 (paSCF𝑖 ) − 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 ) = 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 ) − 𝑓𝑖 (paF𝑖 ) = 0 ∀𝑖 ∈ nd(X𝐼 ) .
In summary, we have
𝑥SCF𝑖 =
{
𝑥F
𝑖
+ 𝛿∗
𝑖
𝑖 ∈ 𝐼
𝑥F
𝑖
𝑖 ∈ nd(X𝐼 )
(A.3)
which, upon realising that (𝛿∗
𝑖
≠ 0) =⇒ (𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ), reduces to
𝒙SCF = 𝒙*CFE := 𝒙F + 𝜹∗ as desired.
¬q =⇒ ¬p: Starting with the negation of q, we have the ∃ 𝑘 ∈
𝐼 s.t. d(𝑋𝑘 ) ≠ ∅. It is assumed that 𝛿∗
𝑘
≠ 0 (i.e., we are not per-
forming a non-altering intervention on 𝑋𝑘 ), then using the same
expression for structural counterfactuals in (A.2), there in general
exists a descendant of𝑋𝑘 for which the value of its ancestors change
under intervention, i.e., ∃ 𝑙 ∈ d(X𝐼 ) s.t. 𝑓𝑙 (paSCF𝑙
) − 𝑓𝑙 (paF𝑙 ) ≠ 0.
Thus, 𝑥SCF
𝑙
≠ 𝑥F
𝑙
and thus 𝒙SCF ≠ 𝒙*CFE := 𝒙F + 𝜹∗. Our proof ig-
nores special cases such as piece-wise constant structural equations,
where for some 𝛿∗
𝑖
≠ 0, the descendant of 𝑋𝑖 remains invariant.
These rare cases can be thought of as locally violating causal mini-
mality [37, Sec. 6.5] and are thus disregarded. □
A.2 Proof of Corollary 3.1
Corollary 3.1. If the true world M is independent, i.e, all the ob-
served features are root-nodes, then CFE-based actions always guar-
antee recourse.
Proof. If the true worldM is independent, then by definition
the set of descendants for all variables is the empty set. Thus, the
statement follows directly from Proposition 3.1. □
A.3 Proof of Proposition 4.1
Proposition 4.1. Given an individual 𝒙F observed in worldM ∈ Π,
a family of feasible actions F , and the solution of (3), A∗ ∈ F .
Assume that there exists CFE-based action ACFE ∈ F that achieves re-
course, i.e., ℎ(𝒙F) ≠ ℎ(𝒙*CFE). Then, cost(A∗
; 𝒙F) ≤ cost(ACFE
; 𝒙F).
Proof. Having assumed that both ACFE,A∗ ∈ F , and consider-
ing thatA∗
is the optimal solution of (3) constrained to F , it follows
from definition of optimality that cost(A∗
; 𝒙F) ≤ cost(ACFE
; 𝒙F).
