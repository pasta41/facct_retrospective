When it is ethical and legal to use a sen-
sitive attribute (such as gender or race) in
machine learning systems, the question re-
mains how to do so. We show that the
näıve application of machine learning algo-
rithms using sensitive attributes leads to
an inherent tradeoff in accuracy between
groups. We provide a simple and efficient
decoupling technique, which can be added
on top of any black-box machine learning
algorithm, to learn different classifiers for
different groups. Transfer learning is used
to mitigate the problem of having too little
data on any one group.
1 INTRODUCTION
As algorithms are increasingly used to make de-
cisions of social consequence, the social values
encoded in these decision-making procedures are
the subject of increasing study, with fairness
being a chief concern (Pedreschi et al., 2008;
Zliobaite et al., 2011; Kamishima et al., 2011;
Dwork et al., 2011; Friedler et al., 2016; Angwin
et al., 2016; Chouldechova, 2017; Kleinberg et al.,
2016; Hardt et al., 2016; Joseph et al., 2016; Kus-
ner et al., 2017; Berk, 2009). Classification and
regression algorithms are one particular locus of
fairness concerns. Classifiers map individuals to
outcomes: applicants to accept/reject/waitlist;
adults to credit scores; web users to advertise-
ments; felons to estimated recidivism risk. In-

formally, the concern is whether individuals are
treated “fairly,” however this is defined. Still
speaking informally, there are many sources of
unfairness, prominent among these being train-
ing the classifier on historically biased data and
a paucity of data for under-represented groups
leading to poor performance on these groups,
which in turn can lead to higher risk for those,
such as lenders, making decisions based on clas-
sification outcomes.
Should ML systems use sensitive attributes,
such as gender or race if available? The legal
and ethical factors behind such a decision vary
by time, country, jurisdiction, culture, and down-
stream application. Still speaking informally, it
is known that “ignoring” these attributes does
not ensure fairness, both because they may be
closely correlated with other features in the data
and because they provide context for understand-

Decoupled Classifiers for Group-Fair and Efficient Machine Learning
ing the rest of the data, permitting a classifier
to incorporate information about cultural differ-
ences between groups (Dwork et al., 2011). Using
sensitive attributes may increase accuracy for all
groups and may avoid biases where a classifier
favors members of a minority group that meet
criteria optimized for a majority group, as illus-
trated visually in Figure 4 of 8.
In this paper, we consider how to use a sen-
sitive attribute such as gender or race to maxi-
mize fairness and accuracy, assuming that it is
legal and ethical. A data scientist wishing to fit,
say, a simple linear classifier, may use the raw
data, upweight/oversample data from minority
groups, or employ advanced approaches to fit-
ting linear classifiers that aim to be accurate and
fair. No matter what he does and what fairness
criteria he uses, assuming no linear classifier is
perfect, he may be faced with an inherent trade-
off between accuracy on one group and accuracy
on another. As an extreme illustrative example,
consider the two group setting illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, where feature x1 perfectly predicts the bi-
nary outcome y ∈ {−1, 1}. For people in group 1
(where x2 = 1), the majority group, y = sgn(x1),
i.e., y = 1 when x1 > 0 and −1 otherwise. How-
ever, for the minority group where x2 = 2, ex-
actly the opposite holds: y = −sgn(x1). Now, if
one performed classification without the sensitive
attribute x2, the most accurate classifier predicts
y = sgn(x1), so the majority group would be per-
fectly classified and the minority group would be
classified as inaccurately as possible. However,
even using the group membership attribute x2,
it is impossible to simultaneously achieve better
than 50% (random) accuracy on both groups.
This is due to limitations of a linear classifier
sgn(w1x1 + w2x2 + b), since the same w1 is used
across groups.
In this paper we define and explore decoupled
classification systems, in which a separate1 classi-
fier is trained on each group. Training a classifier
involves minimizing a loss function that penal-
izes errors; examples include mean squared loss
and absolute loss. In decoupled classification sys-
1. In the case of linear classifiers, training separate clas-
sifiers is equivalent to adding interaction terms be-
tween the sensitive attributes and all other attributes.
More generally, the separate classifiers can equiva-
lently be thought of as a single classifier that branches
on the group attribute. The decoupling technique is a
simple way to add branching to any type of classifier.
tems one first obtains, for each group separately,
a collection of classifiers differing in the numbers
of positive classifications returned for the mem-
bers of the given group. Let this set of outputs
for group k be denoted Ck, k = 1, . . . ,K. The
output of the decoupled training step is an ele-
ment of C1 × . . .×CK , that is, a single classifier
for each group. The output is chosen to minimize
a joint loss function that can penalize differences
in classification statistics between groups. Thus
the loss function can capture group fairness prop-
erties relating the treatment of different groups,
e.g., the false positive (respectively, false nega-
tive) rates are the same across groups; the de-
mographics of the group of individuals receiving
positive (negative) classification are the same as
the demographics of the underlying population;
the positive predictive value is the same across
groups.
