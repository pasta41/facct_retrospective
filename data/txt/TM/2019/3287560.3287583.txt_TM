The growing volume of digital data stimulates the adoption of
recommender systems in dierent socioeconomic domains, includ-
ing news industries. While news recommenders help consumers
deal with information overload and increase their engagement,
their use also raises an increasing number of societal concerns,
such as ‚ÄúMatthew eects‚Äù, ‚Äúlter bubbles‚Äù, and the overall lack of
transparency. We argue that focusing on transparency for content-
providers is an under-explored avenue. As such, we designed a sim-
ulation framework called SIREN1 (SImulating Recommender Eects
in online News environments), that allows content providers to (i)
select and parameterize dierent recommenders and (ii) analyze
and visualize their eects with respect to two diversity metrics.
Taking the U.S. news media as a case study, we present an analy-
sis on the recommender eects with respect to long-tail novelty
and unexpectedness using SIREN. Our analysis oers a number of
interesting ndings, such as the similar potential of certain algorith-
mically simple (item-based k-Nearest Neighbour) and sophisticated
strategies (based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking) to increase
diversity over time. Overall, we argue that simulating the eects of
recommender systems can help content providers to make more
informed decisions when choosing algorithmic recommenders, and
as such can help mitigate the aforementioned societal concerns.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recommender systems play a vital role in dealing with the abun-
dance of online content available. In domains as diverse as e-commerce,
the music and lm industry, social media platforms and the news
media, recommender systems are deployed to help consumers deal
with an information overload by providing ltered and personal-
ized suggestions. At the same time, they help content providers to
increase user engagement/satisfaction and boost sales [48].
In line with broader concerns about the societal consequences
of digital technologies, such recommender systems are not without
criticism. While some scholars herald these as ways to bring niche
items to the attention of the wider public [44], others argue that
recommender systems mostly benet the already popular items by
recommending those even more [9, 39]. Recommender systems cre-
ate in this way what sociologist Merton [35] refers to as ‚ÄúMatthew
eects‚Äù: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. These concerns
about recommender systems reducing diversity have become par-
ticularly salient in the public domain where fears of an increasing
societal fragmentation, the so-called ‚Äúecho chambers‚Äù [51] and ‚Äúl-
ter bubbles‚Äù [45], are widespread. Moreover, as these recommender
systems operate by complex and opaque algorithms, they generally
suer from a lack of transparency [23] and user control [16].
To address these issues, this paper focuses on one particular do-
main where the use of recommender systems by content providers
play an important role, namely the news industry. Since recom-
menders predominantly deliver information that aligns with peo-
ple‚Äôs current interests and preferences, they can drive homogeneity
and could lower people‚Äôs chances to encounter dierent and not
yet discovered contents, opinions and viewpoints [2, 17]. Since the
media form an arena for public debate in which a diversity of voices
should be heard [15, 40], it would have detrimental consequences
to the functioning of our democracies [18, 50].
However, certain works argue that these concerns might have
the signs of a moral panic [5], since it is far from clear whether
recommender systems have such fragmenting eects. A growing
number of studies actually contend that these claims are exagger-
ated [38, 43, 62], since people actively gather and consume news
in many dierent contexts [54]. Moreover, it can be questioned
whether information specialization is necessarily detrimental to
democratic debates [17] or that exposure to a diversity of opinions
is by denition good for society [12, 58].
The point is that more empirical research is needed to assess the
eects of recommender systems. Analyzing their eects is how-
ever a complex task considering the resources needed to track user
behavior in dierent algorithmic regimes, not to mention the con-
sequent ethical concerns. In addition, online news consumption is
governed by a complex interaction between the users‚Äô preferences,
the content provider‚Äôs intent (that translates to editorial priming),
and the webpage-nature of the medium.
This paper presents a synthetic alternative that, we argue, is nev-
ertheless able to shed light on these issues: a simulation frame-
work which allows for the visualization and analysis of the eects
of dierent recommenders systems. This simulation is based on
empirical data, and while a perfect correspondence to reality can-
not be guaranteed, such simulations do provide clear insights into
the tendencies recommender algorithms exhibit. Our simulation
draws mainly on the work of Fleder and Hosanagar who modeled
consumer behavior in an e-commerce context [8, 9]. To account for
the specicities of news consumption, we go beyond an exclusive
focus on recommendation and include both users preferences and
editorial priming as they interact in a news-webpage context.
We named our framework SIREN (SImulating Recommender Eects
in online News environments). It is open-source and enables content
providers to insert their own specications and to test dierent rec-
ommender systems deployed in dierent contexts. The adjustable
parameters of SIREN pertain to the items (articles), users (readers),
as well as the recommendation algorithms themselves, as seen in
Figure 1. SIREN currently allows for the evaluation with respect to
long-tail diversity and unexpectedness diversity metrics to address
the ‚ÄúMatthew‚Äù and lter-bubble eects respectively. By raising
awareness of the consequences of deploying dierent algorithms,
a concrete form of making algorithms more transparent, SIREN
allows content providers to test the eects of the recommendation
algorithms they have in mind with few resources.
In this work, we not only describe the design and implementa-
tion of SIREN (key contribution I ), but also consider a specic case
study‚Äîthe U.S. news media‚Äîand evaluate the eect of dierent
recommender algorithms on long-tail diversity and unexpectedness
metrics (key contribution II ).
