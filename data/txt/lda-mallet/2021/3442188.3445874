Computer Science Communities Who is Speaking and Who is Listening to the Women Using an Ethics of Care to Promote Diverse Voices Those working on policy digital ethics and governance often refer to issues in computer science that includes but is not limited to common subfields such as Artificial Intelligence AI Computer Science Computer Security InfoSec Computer Vision CV Human Computer Interaction HCI Information Systems IS Machine Learning ML Natural Language Processing NLP and Systems Architecture Within this framework this paper is a preliminary exploration of two hypotheses namely Each community has differing inclusion of minoritised groups using women as our test case by identifying female-sounding names and Even where women exist in a community they are not published representatively Using data from research records totalling names preliminary data supported our hypothesis We argue that ACM has an ethical duty of care to its community to increase these ratios and to hold individual computing communities to account in order to do so by providing incentives and a regular reporting system in order to uphold its own Code CONCEPTS Social and professional topics Gender Codes of ethics KEYWORDS gender diversity computer science publishing research sex equality gender representation INTRODUCTION Lack of diversity in research and development of computing technologies has long been a well-recognised problem This persistent problem should be of concern because of both fairness and the quality and breadth of research Further but not canvassed in this paper are the risks to individuals including systemic risks of harm Homogeneity in computer science communities is the most the recent target of a slew of research Some argue that decolonisation of computing and big data which is amplified at speeds and scales previously unimaginable needs to be given much greater regard within computational communities Although the sciences are often thought to be neutral and unbiased the lack of diversity and absence or lack of a variety of different voices in scientific fields is increasingly being researched not just for the sake of individuals but also in the interests of maximising the value and quality of research in those fields The term minoritised rather than minority is used because those represented are not necessarily in the minority more widely speaking but rather are effectively kept in the minority for a wide range of reasons usually by a dominant group To explore these issues we turn to the ethics of care in part because it emphasises closely attending to the experiences and needs of the minoritised Using this ethics of care approach we argue that there is a duty of care and justice to increase diversity within computer science communities and that those with the power need to act to include these people and voices in computational sciences In this paper we focus on women loosely gendered by name in computer science However we also suggest that our broad findings about duties of care and justice can be applied to other minoritised groups We also argue that in addition to meeting ethical responsibilities creating more equitable representation can strengthen the disciplines themselves Lack of diversity can affect both natural sciences and the humanities For example a study on research into birdsong unearthed data that showed that research had been skewed towards male birdsong until female researchers focus turned to female birds Similarly in philosophy feminist methods of articulating ethical theories in areas such as moral philosophy have been few and far between until the emergence of feminist ethics in the s and s In tertiary education female academics are often judged much more harshly by male and female students alike Although these questions are relevant for broader non-mainstream and intersectionality issues such as race class gender etc gender is the easiest within some margin of error to identify and map empirically For this reason we have started the discourse in an area where we could perform automated quantitative analysis This paves the way for future research interviewing experts within each of the sub-fields to gain a clearer understanding of their cultures and drivers In computer science the statistics are not encouraging the number of women studying computer science is falling since the s with numbers falling pretty steadily since the s despite the increase in demand for these types of skills In the broader picture women in STEM Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics make less on average than their male counterparts To date the only breakthroughs include one recent paper has been written about the role that gender plays in senior roles and publishing within HCI However there is a gap in extant research on the status of female academics across computer science communities which look at measures of impact in the context of citations of ranked conferences and papers Although there are many ways to assess diversity such as comparing the number of employees in a field or the number of graduates at a University we choose to take the approach of using publication rates Given the number of fields we are analysing and the volume of the data available we chose this last approach as an entry point to start investigating the state of the different computer science fields relative to each other We wish to stress upfront that gender identification is problematic and may cause representational harm and that sexuality is non-binary an issue surveyed in some detail by Saif M Mohammad In general representational harm is amongst one of the key issues arising from big data usage There are broad methodological caveats that we would like to address upfront in the spirit of transparency Extant algorithms assume gender is a binary construct and hence do not account for diverse gender identities Reiterating a point in Gender is complex and does not necessarily fall into binary male or female categories eg nonbinary people and also does not necessarily correspond to ones assigned gender at birth Most systems for gender determination are deterministic based on prior statistics of name usage Hence there is no other context eg an individuals confirmation of preferred gender marker beyond the mere isolated first name Such binary gender research omits many minoritised groups These systems ignore the fact that people may change their name and appearance to manage their gender citing A strong normative tendency to use names to signal gender can also lead to misgendering a machine associating someone with a gender with which they do not identify which causes harm Besides having a gender disparity computer science still has a disparity in enrollments based on ethnic background an average of difference between White Americans and Black/Hispanic Americans in STEM fields Statistics on first names are biased towards popular/frequently-occurring names in a mostly anglophone context and are limited to the cultural and temporal context when the list is produced eg the USA Social Security Administration Baby Names dataset This causes representational harm to minoritised groups with non-anglophone names We note that although we are focusing on women our concerns include broader intersectionality sexism racism class oppression heterosexism and other axes of oppression in their complex interconnections and representation within the field We are also concerned about marginalisation of all those whose voices need to be amplified in the various fields of computer science We have chosen to use the blunt instrument of automated identification of gender based on names not because it is without risk but because it is critical that we ensure diversity to ensure more fair accountable and transparent systems and this is one method to provoke that debate This is not a study of individuals but an attempt to provoke discussion on the basis of a broad stroke analysis that although problematic we suggest is useful to move the conversation and ethics of duty of care forward to ensure inclusive and better research in computer science Hence in this paper we seek to answer these four initial research questions How are female academics currently represented in publishing in each of the subfields of computer science How do the statistics of publications compare to female representation in each community based on existing research What differences if any are there between different computer science communities What might ethics have to say about underrepresentation of women in computer sciences How can we reduce the disparity We organise this paper as follows First the literature of gender bias in computer science and associated fields are surveyed to ascertain the current state of gender diversity Second we detail our experimental methodology the choice of subfields surveyed in our experiment our data sources and data analysis choices and ethical considerations Third we analyse our results based on extant surveys of subfields and those found in our initial quantitative and qualitative research Fourth we introduce an ethics of care framework and explore some of its implications in computing sciences Finally we introduce some recommendations and explain what further research is necessary LITERATURE REVIEW Some research documents the gender disparity in the sciences including the computer sciences A qualitative study at Stanford University found women only made up of Computer Science professors Causes identified by the researchers include motivation parental support balancing family and personal life any perceived gender biases or discrimination against women the enticement of industry versus academia and the views of both women and men towards women in computer science In a recent study on academic publishing statistics across countries See and disciplines Huang et al investigated citation data of million authors with their gender identified from academic authorship records on Web of Science and independently replicating the results against the Microsoft Academic and DBLP databases Their findings indicate that paradoxically the increase in the number of women academics over the past years has increased gender differences in the total productivity and impact of academic careers in STEM This matches findings in other studies Extrapolating to future authorship trends in computer science Wang et al conducted an analysis on million computer science academic publications since the s using name-based gender inference and time series forecasting The forecast is rather grim based on recent gender trends the proportion of female authors in Computer Science is forecast to not reach parity in this century This result agrees with the work of Holman et al whose analysis of million authors from countries publishing in journals reveals a gender gap which is likely to persist for generations and clearly requires additional interventions if parity is to be reached this century It should be noted that other dimensions in particular local cultural and political context can have an intersectional negative effect on diversity A study by Thelwall et al in the context of STEM in India found that overall there is a substantial overall male bias but the broad research field choice is less influenced by gender In other words male bias still exists overall but the distribution of bias across subfields are different Local factors play a role in changing this distribution examples include a higher coverage of algorithms in Indian mathematics studies and a tendency for males to research thing-oriented topics and for females to research helping people and some life science topics A qualitative study by Lagesen conducted in a Malaysian computer science faculty revealed that more than half the Bachelor students in computer science/information technology are female around of postgraduates are female and encouragingly the majority of the faculty as well as all heads of departments and the dean were women It is clear that computer science is not inherently gendered women can and should succeed given the right circumstances which may include responsible action by the profession Many of the above studies refer to a pipeline effect ie to the likelihood of leaving academia as one progresses through the academic pipeline from undergraduate years to tenure see also There is also literature on the motivations and experiences of university undergraduates in pursuing or otherwise computer science-related courses Sax et als review of American university students survey responses in their freshmen year sampled from to found a persistent sizeable underrepresentation of women across all years in computer science At the same time the number of women in STEM and other professions more broadly has risen however this is a broad generalisation Consider academic postgraduates for instance career aspirations of women and minority groups in postgraduate chemistry have been derailed due to various factors based on a study Also when it comes to applying for grants Australian statistics from the end of suggest that per cent of ARC Australian Research Council LIEF grant recipients were male As well males received per cent of NHMRC National Health and Medical Research Council program grants with per cent of all the men who received an NHMRC grant worked in male-only teams These examples illustrate the factors keeping minoritised groups out of STEM lending further evidence to the pipeline effect METHODOLOGY The motivation for this research was to analyse publication rates by gender in individual communities within computer science from to inclusive The reason is that much of the research on governance and ethical considerations regards computer science as a single area of research when in fact it is constituted by many individual sometimes overlapping communities In designing this papers methodology we consulted existing literature on experimental methods or heuristics used to approximate gender representation in academia The most frequently used heuristic is inferring gender from author names in publication records accessible via academic citation databases Commonly used databases include DBLP Microsoft Academic Scopus and Web of Science In terms of the actual algorithmic methods used for name-to-gender inference Santamaría and Mihaljević have conducted a thorough literature review and benchmark on five such services In brief there are both offline techniques using open data such as gender-guesser for Python which is based on curated data sources and online techniques web services or APIs which are proprietary in nature such as genderizeio and GenderAPI Offline techniques use simple statistics based on frequency of names with the advantage of algorithmic transparency and simplicity but with the disadvantage of not being frequently updated or representative of the global population eg not being able to infer culturally-diverse names Online techniques are the inverse they have a higher accuracy and inclusion of diverse names but with the disadvantage of being a commercial offering without much transparency about their inner workings The use of name-to-gender algorithms have ethical caveats and limitations documented in our Introduction Section Determining Subfields of Study For this paper we have identified nine subfields of computer science based both on our own experience in the discipline and the identification of common research focus areas in top universities These subfields represent common research themes in academic institutions with a computer science department which included similar-sounding departments such as computer systems and information technology These nine subfields are Artificial Intelligence AI Computer Science Computer Security or cybersecurity or information security abbreviated InfoSec Computer Vision CV Human Computer Interaction HCI Information Systems IS Machine Learning ML Natural Language Processing NLP and Systems Architecture SA The capitalised proper nouns are used to uniquely identify this subfield as indicated in Microsoft Academic Section and the abbreviations are used throughout this paper for brevity To elaborate when referred to as a subfield concerns areas such as theoretical computer science eg formal methods ACM is the worlds largest educational and scientific computing society and delivers resources that advance computing as a science and a profession including to each of these communities However we note that an important area of emerging research in computing Information Ethics also known as AI Ethics and equivalent is not covered in our survey nor is the long-established area of Software Engineering The latter is for our purposes classed as a subfield of engineering And although there have over many decades been nods to ethics the field of ethics in computer science is still emerging as a truly interdisciplinary field and as a rigorous discipline that for example regularly involves experts in philosophical ethics Data Collection Based on the literature surveyed eg we have decided to use Microsoft Academic as our data source as it comes with a programmer-friendly API for programmatic data downloads of citation information More importantly Microsoft Academic also provides author and paper metadata such as research organization and paper category topic which lets us classify each paper based on their subfield of computer science Section For each of the subfields in Section we query the Microsoft Academic API v for citation records provided on a best-effort basis using the default parameters of the API The total of is chosen as it balances the need for a large sample size with due consideration for Microsofts server resources Experimentally values higher than results in server timeouts which indicate a high server load we avoid this to conserve server resources To further reduce the strain on the server in consideration of the data provider and other fellow users successful data fetches are limited to no more than two per hour and the metadata items requested are limited to only a subset of the full metadata available The results provided from the Microsoft Academic API are in JSON format which is then processed in Python for subsequent steps We firstly perform data deduplication by removing any duplicated citation within- and across-categories such that any unique citation appears only once within the entire dataset Ties are broken in alphabetical order eg a paper which has been dual-classified in the topic Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be included in the former but not the latter A grand total of citations are obtained after the deduplication process Inference Algorithm and Considerations By considering the options in our aforementioned literature review on name-to-gender algorithms we have decided to use a two-step process in the interest of reducing costs in the case of paid online services while maintaining some degree of transparency to the process by prioritizing offline methods using published datasets We initially considered the use of the arXiv repository as it is a popular site hosting preprints for computer science papers Unfortunately many author first names are provided only as initials eg Doe instead of Jane Doe which render the algorithms ineffective Based on the analysis given in as well as initial experimentation with popular Python gender-detection libraries we have chosen gender-guesser for the offline option and keeping in line with extant research methods we chose the genderizeio web service as the paid online option The following algorithm was used in determining gender distributions in each of the particular subfields For each citation obtain first names of all authors Authors whose first name consists of a sole initial are discarded as the gender detection algorithm will not work Each authors first name is first processed with the offline gender-guesser Python library which returns a classification and a classification confidence male mostly male ie predicted as male with a higher and a lower degree of confidence respectively female mostly female as before androgynous gender neutral or unknown The difference between the last two is that androgynous names could statistically be in either the male and female name classes eg Pauley Names categorised as unknown are not found at all in the dataset used by the library Any names marked unknown by gender-guesser are likely to be from a non-anglophone background hence based on the track record of genderizeio for processing culturally-diverse names it is used for second-round processing Genderizeio returns either male female or unknown The final classification from Step or Step if Step was inconclusive was then used an output point in the overall aggregation Repeat Step for all authors per citation and for all citations in dataset Note that we do not remove duplicated names across papers eg if hypothetical author Shanti Kumar was present across three papers we count three separate instances This presupposes that removing duplications may in fact present a more negative outcome than the current analysis containing a margin of error already present further we do not wish to dilute the contribution of a single author but instead would want to consider overall impact EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Statistics on Gender in Subfield Figure illustrates the overall distribution of the genders resulting from our inference method Section the left inset includes names where gender cannot be inferred reliably by automated techniques undetected as well as when a name is deemed to be gender-neutral and the right inset has gender-neutral terms and undetected names removed for a direct comparison The total number of author names range from to mean sd per subfield The proportion of males outnumber those of females for each of the nine subfields in our study For the direct comparison case a simple Analysis of Variance ANOVA in Microsoft Excels Data Analysis Toolpak with confirms that the count of males versus Some libraries including gender-detector were promising candidates due to their usage of open datasets but ultimately were not suitable for our purposes due to performance issues and compatibility issues See Footnote a top inset Gender distribution of authors by subfield including gender-neutral names and undetected names b bottom inset Direct comparison between male and female author ratios excluding gender-neutral and undetected names Figure Empirical results from our methodology females is statistically significant with Gender Diversity by Subfield Less Gender Diverse AI InfoSec CV ML SA From Figure b we observe that gender representation in publications within a particular subfield is roughly divided into two categories based on ratio of gender which we term less gender diverse and slight improvement The former is the subject of analysis in this subsection Accounting for a direct male-to-female comparison these subfields of AI InfoSec CV ML and SA have between to female authorship This translates to an approximate ratio of males to females To make sense of these statistics we turn to extant literature discussing the state of these subfields to compare our findings against the actual population of female academics AI and ML has been traditionally low in female representation with significant differences in machine learning and computer ethics between the United States and the United Kingdom as well as differences in the research focus of papers with female co-authors One hypothesis is that subfields with high emphasis on mathematical and scientific techniques such as ML CV suffer more from historical biases leading to an overrepresentation of males see Section When we examine InfoSec industry trends in based on a survey by the ISC cybersecurity professional organisation are such that women in the information security profession represent of the global workforce a percentage that remains unchanged from the study but of IT professionals worldwide are women Slight Improvement NLP IS HCI The second category encompasses the subfields of NLP IS and HCI and has the proportion of female authors ranging from to These have a nett effect of a roughly male-female ratio Extant findings from these subfields explain the slight improvement in the male-female ratios HCI has had issues regarding representation of women which are canvassed by McKay and Buchanan Via an analysis of OzCHI the Australian HCI conference venue these authors claim that female representation is quite good but we need to be cautious to preserve it In the subfield of NLP we hypothesise that female representation is higher than the broader umbrella of AI based on the anecdotal evidence from research addressing language bias To quote Leavy leading thinkers in the emerging field addressing bias in artificial intelligence specifically language models are also primarily female suggesting that those who are potentially affected by bias are more likely to see understand and attempt to resolve it As for IS academics in this subfield are in a position to contribute to addressing the challenge of gender imbalance in the IT profession noting that issues of gender discrimination in IS have been found as early as if not earlier A more detailed discussion on female perceptions of IS and subfields which closely relate to the genesis of computing can be found in Section Algorithmic Limitations Our study has limitations The automated nature of gender recognition has methodological caveats Section and technical caveats Section From our earlier trials the analysis is suboptimal when only the gender-guesser package is used From initial experiments the margin of undetected names is unacceptably high ranging from to in the absence of using genderizeio as a second step This illustrates the fact that existing methods still have a way to go in future research Human judgement is preferable to automated analyses and could be performed in future research with smaller samples or in a hybrid human coding technique assisted by a rule-based system The organisation conducting this survey is stylised ISC DISCUSSION Lessons from the Ethics of Care Our results raise important ethical and social issues To explore them we shall use the normative theory known as ethics of care or care ethics CE We choose this ethical approach not because it is the only useful normative theory for exploring such issues nor because it is beyond criticism all normative theories are controversial but because its strong connection to key themes arising from issues pertinent to our study makes it particularly illuminating Although CE has been applied in some detail to areas like medicine and business it has been less frequently applied to computer science and its subfields in particular artificial intelligence CE arose in the s and s in the context of feminist critiques of male-dominated historical and prevailing ways of doing philosophical ethics Although CE and feminist ethics are distinct such that for example one can be a feminist ethicist without subscribing to CECE nevertheless draws heavily on feminist modes of thought that question masculine moral approaches and assumptions that historically were never or were only rarely questioned CE criticised the then dominant conception of the moral agent as independent unattached self-sufficient unemotional and rationalistic Psychologist Carol Gilligans seminal early s work In A Different Voice brought to light the dominance in ethics discourse of moral values related to this conception of moral agents These associated values included a preference for relatively unvarying principles and rules impartiality and detachment liberal ideals of justice and contractarian thinking At around the same time the philosopher Nel Noddings emphasised the importance to moral agency and experience of human interdependence and of caring and being cared for The emerging more relational conception of moral agency and moral life stressed values such as responsiveness compassion contextual understanding and co-dependent relationships A greater attentiveness to lived experience as opposed to a detached manner of observation that obscures the details of individuals lives was brought to the fore Since Gilligan and Noddings a range of female and sometimes male philosophers have added to the corpus of work on CE deepening its basis and applying its ideas to a range of contexts and practices Philosopher Raja Halwani summarises the essence of CE by identifying four of its desiderata namely the concern with people embedded in contextual relations attention to areas of life neglected by some traditional moral philosophy such as friendship and the family the emphasis on the emotive component in ethical engagement and partiality Thus CE foregrounds nurturing relationships biological and emotional needs affective engagement or what exponents call engrossment and the role of associated contextual features in shaping morality and giving rise to responsibility and obligation For many care ethicists these elements spring especially from the lives and historical experiences of women such so-called feminine values and experiences tend to stand in contrast to the experiences of men and the values championed by predominantly male philosophers In these ways CE represents a distinct approach to ethics alongside the more established normative theories of deontology utilitarianism contract theory and to an arguably lesser extent virtue ethics However CE has been criticised on a number of fronts Broaching several such criticisms and briefly discussing how CE can respond to them will help us to apply this approach to the findings of this study CE might be criticised for essentializing gender overlooking gender diversity and fluidity and stereotyping men and women For example some men embody feminine values like nurturing and compassion just as some women embody masculine values like moral rationalism and extreme impartiality However although CE grew from and encompasses feminist critiques of male-centred ethics it may reject essentialism accept non-binary views of gender and agree that feminine values of caring are not the exclusive preserve of women Indeed it may champion these positions while stressing that women nonetheless are often well-placed to identify and respond to the values at the heart of the CE approach In Noddings words there are centuries of experience more typical of women than men Such experience of course includes not only the experience of the mother-child relation but the experience of caring more generally The patriarchal conditions of womens historical caring including motherhood may raise the concern that the caring outlook is not always laudable but rather may be a function of oppression and an associated distortion of perspective Entrenched power imbalances it might be suggested could have led to forms of moral blindness centring on a problematic valourising of caring relations Yet a CE proponent may reply that these historical and moreover persisting inequalities in power may on the contrary often give women and we should also stress women at various intersections such as women of colour and women with disabilities greater insight into a range of moral matters including the unfairness of many circumstances and caring relations occupied predominantly by women the oppression of people of different sexualities and genders and the needs of individuals and groups who are marginalised and especially vulnerable This is not to say that men cannot also adopt such perspectives and the relevant forms of moral attentiveness it is rather to note that ethical insight into certain states of affairs can sometimes be sharpened by cultural historical and biological circumstances At the same time we can say that from the point of view of care ethicists men too have reason to adopt a CE position Given these points it is perhaps somewhat ironic that CE has been criticised for lacking the resources to give guidance on political and moral questions regarding those to whom we do not have special and partial relations Nonetheless it is a serious question Can CE then say anything significant about justice outside of those paradigmatic relations of care There are many individuals more distant from us both geographically and personally who are nevertheless particularly vulnerable CE its proponents may say can both recognise and highlight the situations of such people and the moral necessity for them to receive care just as those personally close to us need and deserve care Furthermore the ethical attentiveness and responsiveness to need that is rightly cultivated and honoured in more personal caring contexts can in some form be extended to strangers be they disenfranchised fellow citizens or people from foreign places The caring attitude can also be extended to say academic colleagues who have needs and require support and even sometimes nurturing Therefore CE need not displace or overlook the promotion of justice for more distant others but rather can arguably recognise inform and deepen the notion of justice Again people of any sex or gender can adopt this CE viewpoint Ethics of Care and Computer Science Having briefly outlined some of the features problems and strengths of CE we can now apply it to our findings Our study suggests that women are strongly underrepresented in all subfields of computer sciences in some even more than in others From a CE perspective this is problematic for several reasons which we will now briefly discuss In the first place there is the issue of justice or fairness for women themselves Many women have historically had strong interests in pursuing careers across the various divisions of computer science However due to historical and persisting power imbalances which may include both overt discrimination and subtle and implicit biases it is often harder for women than it is for men to enter computer sciences and once there to climb institutional ladders Interestingly it was not always this way The first analytical machine the precursor to the computer was created by Ada Lovelace Computing was predominantly populated by women until it became a profession and was paid a proper salary around the mid-s In essence critical factors dissuading participation of females in computer science in the beginning of the pipeline include the change in perception from the s from a field perceived to be more clerical in nature to its redefinition as a science which distanced itself from skill sets traditionally thought to be well suited to women and sought to align itself with other science fields like engineering that had strong masculine connotations citing Existing biases against women in STEM-based academic jobs may draw them towards leaving the academic pipeline see also Section This effect is partially offset by countervailing factors such as the promotion of computing skills in mathematics or affirmative action policies to close the gender gap Nonetheless as our results show it appears to be the case that women are particularly excluded from certain areas of computer sciences like CV AI and InfoSec Moral attentiveness and responsiveness to womens important needs are qualities and behaviours that a CE viewpoint can endorse and promote In addition CE can as we explained recognise the importance of forms of justice that regard others as deserving of care and in this specific context as individuals whose talents and aspirations should be appreciated and nurtured As we noted CE is strongly oriented to recognising and responding to historical and persisting disadvantage and vulnerability Furthermore CE suggests that again due to historical and persisting circumstances women including those with lived experience at A particularly relevant quote by Steve Henn explains this A lot of computing pioneers the people who programmed the first digital computers were women And for decades the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men But in something changed See also com/news/coding-used-to-be-a-womans-job-so-it-was-paid-less-and-undervalued various social and political intersections often have particularly keen moral insights into matters related to care gender vulnerability marginalization and so on Again making this claim is not necessarily to fall prey to gender essentialism or the stereotyping of any particular gender it is rather to register the potential effects of context and circumstance on the moral attentiveness and responsiveness of certain situated individuals Insofar as some women bring these qualities and perspectives into areas of computer science they may help to expand the moral awareness of their colleagues including those who are more established and in positions of power And this may be of benefit to future women and other marginalised groups who want to work in those fields Increasing the chances of the entry of other moral perspectives and experiences into computer sciences is likely to generate benefits to others beyond those who wish to work in computer sciences This could include both the subjects of computer sciences research and wider groups of individuals including disenfranchised and marginalised people Moral qualities prized by CE are often important in regard to the rightful treatment of individuals in research and experiments especially those who are more vulnerable such as transgender individuals children and some people with disabilities HCI researchers may to take just one example study the needs of older people including those with dementia for attaining degrees of digital literacy and enrichment Due in some part to implicit biases older adults are an example of a group that tends to get overlooked in relation to new technologies Care ethicists themselves have often focused on various groups who have been socially marginalised subjected to prejudice and furthermore relatively neglected by mainstream normative theories Eva Kittay for example has used CE to stress the moral necessity of caring in the right way not just for individuals who are capable of achieving a full range of human flourishing but also and vitally those with severe cognitive impairments whose opportunities in life are comparatively and sometimes profoundly limited Kittay highlights the value of such caring relations to both the carer and the cared-for For thinkers like her CE asks us to be just as attentive to the needs of people struck by misfortune as to the interests of people who have higher degrees of self-sufficiency autonomy and independence Both CE and the moral experiences and perspectives of many women lend themselves to a caring-style concern and sense of justice for vulnerable individuals in the community who may be more broadly affected by the computer sciences Sometimes this will involve a sensitivity to the effects of computer sciences on women themselves For example close attention must be paid to technologies which require the training of algorithms on data sets that could introduce gender biases with potential negative consequences for women in the general public The same also goes for technologies that could harm various marginalised and vulnerable groups of people and as for example ecofeminists recognize nonhuman animals Identification and active correction of a range of ethico-social problems is not only important because of the harm done to various individuals Ameliorating existing inequality also has the potential to improve the quality of the science itself Just as being attentive to the song of female as well as male birds a dimension of animal behaviour overlooked because of the bias of male researchers enriches and improves ornithology so too does heightened attentiveness to biases faulty assumptions and prejudice potentially enrich broaden and improve computer sciences This applies not only to the more human-centred subfields like HCI but also to more technical and as our results show especially male-dominated subfields like CV and AI Therefore creating the conditions for greater gender equality and other kinds of equality across the subfields of computer sciences should be seen less as a threat than as an opportunity for enhancing the rigour and value of the discipline On top of the ethical arguments this last point about the quality of the disciplines provides further support and additional leverage for making changes to the current system to advance gender equity Recommendations and Professional Responsibilities The CE framework supports not only the passive avoidance of say discriminatory hiring practices but also the active nurturing of individuals and the modification of institutional attitudes and structures that prevent women and other minoritised groups from fairly occupying roles in the various subfields of computer science Furthermore our discussion of how CE applies to computer science can be used to justify and reinforce existing professional standards The Association for Computing Machinery ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for example contains several ethical principles relevant to our discussion of gender and other kinds of diversity Thus Principle of the ACM Code says that Computing professionals should foster fair participation of all people including those of underrepresented groups Prejudicial discrimination on the basis of age color disability ethnicity family status gender identity labor union membership military status nationality race religion or belief sex sexual orientation or any other inappropriate factor is an explicit violation of the Code The use of information and technology may cause new or enhance existing inequities Technologies and practices should be as inclusive and accessible as possible and computing professionals should take action to avoid creating systems or technologies that disenfranchise or oppress people Failure to design for inclusiveness and accessibility may constitute unfair discrimination Indeed the ACM Code even says Principle that when the interests of multiple groups conflict the needs of those less advantaged should be given increased attention and priority The Code then calls for resolute action to be taken on behalf of individuals facing injustice and discrimination Such a strong stance is supported by a CE approach with its particular emphasis upon people in need of care and justice Furthermore the ACM calls upon its members to Principle strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work This provides another reason for striving to remove disadvantage and injustice since as we have argued underrepresentation of women and other groups can have a negative effect on the quality and breadth of the work done in the subfields of computer science Given the standards to which the ACM aspires under its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and given the arguments we have presented from the ethics of care we would argue that the computing community has responsibilities and caring duties to promote and support those standards One concrete way to promote this is for the ACM to monitor compliance with its principles and to set up a dashboard of compliance against which computer science communities can measure themselves annually providing accountability within their own community and to the computer science community at large This includes metrics of performance and inclusion not only of gender but also of race disability class sexuality and numerous other minoritised groups Providing such metrics will raise awareness and comparison between communities hopefully also leading to sharing of best practice and changes in behaviour Meanwhile those communities already working on diversity and inclusion and contemplating governance could share their experience and strategies with other communities In addition a best practice guide might be facilitated by the ACM These are just a sample of the concrete steps the ACM should consider Which other detailed responses should be pursued depends on further research including hearing the views of a diverse range of stakeholders Our key point in this preliminary study however is that such concrete steps are urgent and necessary and that they should be guided by the sorts of attentiveness to and engagement with minoritised individuals that CE so clearly brings out Translating these high-level aspirations into concrete action points would be one step in the direction of fulfilling the requirement to use CE in decision-making FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSION This study is the first step in a bigger project to identify outputs and cultures relating to fairness accountability and transparency within the different computer science communities To move this project forward it would be helpful to investigate what systems research and active members address these issues and to test the hypothesis that more diverse communities will in fact have more advanced systems academic work and conversations about fairness accountability and transparency If this hypothesis is not correct it would be useful to explore what helps to advance these conversations and considerations within individual communities Our hypothesis is based on research in other fields that have indicated that diversity is key to good research Using this study as a stepping stone we intend to undertake further qualitative research to analyse what works in the various communities what does not and how these successes and failures can be better shared The next step involves qualitative research within each of the communities to ask minoritised members about their lived experience and the cultures within each field including successes and failures and what we can learn from both to achieve the standards set out by the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct This can include follow up studies with women who dropped out of careers and figure out why they left with reference to the academic pipeline Section Finally we would invite other scholars to investigate how we could fulfil our ethical duties of care to the computer science and broader community
