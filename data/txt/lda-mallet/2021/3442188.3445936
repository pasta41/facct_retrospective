On the Moral Justification of Statistical Parity A crucial but often neglected aspect of algorithmic fairness is the question of how we justify enforcing a certain fairness metric from a moral perspective When fairness metrics are proposed they are typically argued for by highlighting their mathematical properties Rarely are the moral assumptions beneath the metric explained Our aim in this paper is to consider the moral aspects associated with the statistical fairness criterion of independence statistical parity To this end we consider previous work which discusses the two worldviews What You See Is What You Get WYSIWYG and Were All Equal WAE and by doing so provides some guidance for clarifying the possible assumptions in the design of algorithms We present an extension of this work which centers on morality The most natural moral extension is that independence needs to be fulfilled if and only if differences in predictive features eg high school grades and standardized test scores are predictive of performance at university between socio-demographic groups are caused by unjust social disparities or measurement errors Through two counterexamples we demonstrate that this extension is not universally true This means that the question of whether independence should be used or not cannot be satisfactorily answered by only considering the justness of differences in the predictive features CONCEPTS Applied computing Law social and behavioral sciences Computing methodologies Machine learning Social and professional topics Socio-technical systems KEYWORDS fairness independence statistical parity distributive justice bias INTRODUCTION A look at current practices suggests that in order to evaluate the fairness of a given machine learning model so-called fairness metrics have to be computed However this disregards the crucial steps which should precede the calculation of fairness metrics discussing the moral reasons underlying the decision to select one or more fairness metrics to be enforced This is easily forgotten as the procedure is not as straightforward as computing statistical metrics It might require discussions with the stakeholders of the application and finding a compromise after all there are very few cases where everyone can agree on the correct choice of fairness metrics in particular because it has been shown that some of them are conflicting It is thus important to not only provide mathematical definitions of fairness metrics but to provide some guidance on how to reason about them from a moral perspective One popular metric is called independence often referred to as statistical parity While existing literature at first sight often seems to reason about independence in moral terms a lot of the arguments are either not backed up by moral philosophy or turn out to be purely mathematical We note that the need for enforcing independence is rarely justified from a philosophical perspective and that the two spaces philosophy and mathematics are often conflated in part also due to terminology In this paper we want to make a contribution towards resolving this ambiguity and to highlight the relation between mathematical justifications for choosing independence and the corresponding moral significance We begin by defining independence mathematically in Section and then reconstruct arguments on when independence is considered the correct fairness metric in Section We will show that these arguments while at first sight appearing to hold moral value are actually purely mathematical if taken literally However since they suggest that there are moral reasons for choosing independence we will provide a natural extension for the arguments found in the literature Section We will then argue that this natural extension is not always in line with our moral intuitions about fairness in specific cases Section We conclude in Section that the question whether independence should be chosen or not is not sufficiently answered by considering the social injustices occurring from the birth of an individual to the point where their abilities are measured WHAT IS INDEPENDENCE The arguably most commonly used category of fairness metrics is referred to as group fairness and focuses on the question whether socio-demographic groups are treated similarly or receive similar outcomes Group fairness is tested with respect to specific socio-demographic groups differentiated through a sensitive attribute which we will denote as One of the more prominent fairness metrics falling into the category of group fairness is statistical parity The concept is easiest to explain for binary classification and two groups and In such a case statistical parity requires that the probability of the predicted outcome being positive ie is equal for and In other words the selection rate has to be independent of the value of the sensitive attribute This can be expressed as This formula can be generalized for the case of not only a binary predictor but any predictor and possibly more values for the sensitive attribute This general proposition is referred to as the fairness criterion independence Independence can be found implemented in practice in particular in the HR domain and has been particularly influential in the early stages of the algorithmic fairness literature see eg Together with independence lists separation and sufficiency as the three fairness criteria that most fairness metrics that have been proposed in the literature are closely related to Separation and sufficiency gained more attention in recent years through the debate sparked by Angwin et als investigative article Machine Bias Subsequent publications have pointed out what is now known as the impossibility theorem Except for in highly constrained cases we can only satisfy one of the three fairness criteria This impossibility theorem forces us to pick a specific fairness criterion to enforce or to find a trade-off between them which raises the question of when one criteria should be chosen over the other two In this paper we will focus on the moral reasons for enforcing independence Unsurprisingly machine learning models trained to optimize for example accuracy rarely coincidentally fulfill independence However we can enforce independence through various strategies see eg This idea is what we will refer to with the phrase independence should be used We can either enforce achieving independence fully or partially eg because we want to trade off fairness with another goal such as business interests or utilitarian moral goals such as maximizing the number of lives saved WHEN SHOULD INDEPENDENCE BE USED The question of when independence should be chosen over separation and sufficiency cannot be answered from a purely mathematical or technical perspective Friedler et al propose a framework which enables its users to clarify the worldview assumed in the context of their application This section will discuss Friedler et als The popularity of independence in HR is attributable to the notion of disparate impact found in the Uniform Guidelines on Employment Selection Procedures introduced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC in Disparate impact means that one group is disproportionally affected by eg a hiring policy When bringing forth a disparate impact claim the /ths rule works as a rule of thumb It compares the share of hired people from each group If one groups hiring rate is less than /ths of the hiring rate of the other group then HR might be liable for disparate impact discrimination This /ths rule is essentially an expression of statistical parity that allows for some leeway Instead of enforcing the perfect equalization of hiring rates it allows for some difference in hiring rates Even though this rule is just a rule of thumb Raghavan et al recently showed that vendors of algorithmic hiring tools treat it as a hard constraint The web demo of AIF a tool built for the bias auditing of predictive models refers to statistical parity as being fulfilled if the /ths rule is fulfilled We thus see that through the /ths rule the notion of independence is highly relevant in practice paper and distill the implicit rules for when to apply independence We also argue that the framework presented by Friedler et al is insufficient to represent the philosophical debate surrounding independence and thus propose an extension of their framework Existing Framework The premise of Friedler et als framework is that when a decision has to be made by using data-driven predictions this prediction is based not on the features that we would ideally have access to but on proxies This is reflected in the main result of which is the distinction between the following three spaces see Figure a the Construct Space which consists of the features that we want to base the decision on the Observed Space OS which consists of the features that we actually base the decision on because the is not observable so the Observed Space OS is our proxy for the and the Decision Space which encompasses the predictions based on the OS In order to clarify the theoretical explanations we will work with an exemplary scenario throughout this paper which to some extent has also been used in hiring In this case the task is to predict employee productivity and take a hiring decision based on this prediction We borrow the language for this example from A company picks whom to hire from the pool of candidates ie the people who apply for the job In order to make this decision the company tries to predict who will perform best when hired Each candidate brings certain qualifications based on which the company wishes to make its choice However these qualifications are not directly observable eg how good they are at selling the companys product how well they fit into the existing team etc Instead the company only has access to noisy representations of these qualifications which we will refer to as proxies These proxies typically include the CV the motivation letter the impressions from the interviews etc As the company only has access to the qualifications through the proxies it has to base its hiring decisions on the proxies In this example the qualifications are equivalent to the unobservable while the proxies represent the observable OS Friedler et al present two opposing worldviews and advocate for being transparent about which one the prediction model adheres to The two opposing worldviews are What You See Is What You Get WYSIWYG which assumes that there are barely any differences between the OS and the meaning that the OS is a good proxy for the This implies that observed differences between sociodemographic groups correspond to actual differences In our example that would mean that the usage of CVs interviews We discuss this particular paper as it uncovers the hidden assumptions that seem to be held when algorithmic fairness scholars advocate for independence The paper is well-known in the field and has influenced both theoretical and practical work On the practical side the two opposing worldviews have been described in AIFs web demo to guide practitioners in their choice of fairness criterion Theoretical work has built on Friedler et als framework to eg provide mathematical ways to interpolate the proposed opposing worldviews Mitchell et al cite Friedler et als reasoning when explaining when enforcing independence should be considered etc as the proxy for the candidates qualifications neither harms nor benefits one group more than another Measurement Bias MB which assumes that the mapping of individuals from the to the OS introduces disparities between the socio-demographic groups implying that differences between groups in the OS are bigger than in the For the hiring example this means that using CVs as proxies of qualifications harms one group compared to another one Friedler et al refer to the second worldview as structural bias However we will call this worldview MB in order to distinguish it from the informal usage of the term structural bias Furthermore Friedler et al propose the axiom Were All Equal WAE which oftentimes aligns with the worldview MB WAE assumes that in the construct space all groups look essentially the same and that there are no innate differences between groups p If we assume that there are no innate differences in the abilities of socio-demographic groups to perform well on a job but measure differences once we evaluate their CVs we will see these observed differences as a result of the MB Due to this conceptual closeness of WAE and MB the literature oftentimes presents Were All Equal WAE and What You See Is What You Get WYSIWYG as the two opposing worldviews Our Extension of the Framework When discussing the cause of group differences in the OS Friedler et als framework quickly reaches its limits The main issue is that two different spaces are conflated and merged in the Although Friedler et al recognize this they justify not differentiating between the two by saying that a differentiation would still lead to the same mathematical outcome p However we believe that it is necessary to clearly distinguish these two spaces as it increases the understanding of the decision making process and helps navigate the moral assessment More specifically it clarifies at which stage the differences that we observe between groups in the OS are introduced This is needed when discussing the morality of independence as independence looks at the which of course relies entirely on the OS Therefore we need terms to discuss the causes of difference in OS if we want to morally justify enforcing independence in the We base our extension on the work of Rawls who differentiates between realized abilities and innate potential or as Rawls writes native endowments Potential is innate to an individual and determined at birth This could for example be their innate intelligence or predisposition eg extroversion to develop the traits for being a good sales person The realized abilities represent how good job candidates actually are at making sales at the time when the company is looking to hire This may be influenced by early socialization in the family the type of school they went to the university they attended the opportunities they were given At birth here should be considered as at conception since there is already social influence at the fetal stage Native endowments of various kinds say native intelligence or natural ability are not fixed natural assets with a constant capacity They are merely potential and cannot come to fruition apart form social conditions Educated and trained abilities are always a selection from a wide range of possibilities that might have been fulfilled Among what affects their realisation are social attitudes of encouragement and support and institutions opportunities and social position and the influence of good and ill fortune internships etc and so on The realized abilities is what we will keep referring to as the in our extension We introduce a new space which represents the potential The Potential Space PS Figure b shows the spaces and biases that we differentiate in our model The spaces can be understood as different stages We start with our innate potential represented by the Potential Space PS at birth Shaped by our life experiences we realize our abilities to potentially different degrees which is captured in the The realized abilities are then measured in the OS The OS is used as the basis of the predictions in the The introduction of the PS gives us the ability to differentiate between two types of were all equal which are conflated in Friedler et als description of WAE We will define them as distinct worldviews Note that besides assuming one of these worldviews it is also possible to hold both views at the same time or neither of them as they are not opposing Were All Equal in the PS WAEPS meaning all groups have the same innate potential This means that lacking Lifes Bias LB which will be defined below all groups would have the same realized abilities Were All Equal in the WAECS meaning all groups have the same realized abilities even though it may look differently when taking measurements This is the literal interpretation of were all equal which implies that all groups are currently equal in their abilities As noted earlier Friedler et al formally define WAE as equality in the but leave the option that it may also be interpreted as equality in the PS We explicitly distinguish the two worldviews as we see it as necessary for discussing independence from a philosophical perspective The distinction between PS and allows us to define another type of bias As already stated Friedler et al refer to the introduction of group differences from the to the OS as structural bias while we refer to it as MB since it is introduced through the act of measuring and is dependent on eg availability of information or variable selection As seen in Figure a they also term the bias introducing group differences from the OS to the direct discrimination We introduce a third bias which is the bias from the PS to the Inequalities such as differences in the qualities of schools and universities the income and connections of their parents etc can set individuals with the same potential far apart in terms of their realized abilities We will refer to these inequalities as Lifes Bias LB We remain neutral at this stage on whether LB is the same as injustice We notice in passing that if injustice exists it may affect LB For example if people routinely act based on gender stereotypes men and women with the same potential may end up expressing different realized abilities to a different degree Furthermore if acting based on gender stereotypes is morally wrong as it seems plausible LB will be unjust In cases like this we shall refer to LB as unjust LB for precisions sake Rules Distilled From the Framework We will now again consider the framework proposed by Friedler et al to distill rules about when and why to choose independence as the fairness measure The extension of Friedler et als framework measurement bias direct discrimination OS a Friedler et al lifes bias PS measurement bias direct discrimination OS b Our extension Figure Relationship between the spaces and biases presented in the previous section will be used in order to clarify the position of the paper In order to understand Friedler et als reasons for recommending independence we have to introduce two key terms that appear in their proposal Fairness and non-discrimination We refer to for a mathematically precise definition but the idea can be expressed as follows Fairness Individuals who are close in the are fairly close in the Non-discrimination The difference between groups is not notably increased from the to the In order to avoid confusion with the colloquial way of using these terms we will avoid using these terms in any other way than defined by Friedler et al If we do use them in the colloquial or philosophical sense we will make this evident from here on We find that the paper considers the usage of independence from two perspective One perspective specifies the assumptions justifying the enforcement of independence IF assumption THEN independence should be used and the other one describes which assumptions are implied when enforcing independence is argued for IF independence should be used THEN assumption We will discuss both perspectives separately and derive a proposition summarizing them as a single rule IF assumption THEN independence should be used The first perspective asks the question what condition has to be met for suggesting the enforcement of independence Friedler et al state that under a structural bias worldview only group fairness mechanisms achieve non-discrimination and individual fairness mechanisms are discriminatory p Note that group fairness mechanisms here refers to algorithms fulfilling independence and not any group fairness metric and that structural bias is what we refer to as MB This statement should be interpreted to mean that if we assume MB only independence can achieve non-discrimination but it is not a guarantee In fact they present an example in which MB is assumed but there are differences in the In this case enforcing independence would still be discriminatory They conclude that enforcing independence only guarantees non-discrimination if WAECS is also assumed This leads to the following first rule for Friedler et al This corresponds to Dwork et als fairness constraint which requires that similar individuals are treated similarly Proposition IF there is MB AND WAECS THEN independence should be used IF independence should be used THEN assumption Friedler et al claim that under a WYSIWYG worldview ie no MB group fairness mechanisms ie independence are unfair p This can be translated as IF WYSIWYG THEN NOT independence should be used because we otherwise create unfairness Since WYSIWYG is equivalent to NOT there is MB the rule can be restated as IF NOT there is MB THEN NOT independence should be used From that we know that independence should only be used if there is MB After all if there is no MB then independence should not be used From this we can follow the other side of the rule IF independence should be used THEN there is MB because we otherwise create unfairness Further Friedler et al write that when the goal is to bring this difference between groups in the close to zero the assumption is that groups should as a whole receive similar outcomes This reflects an underlying assumption of the were all equal axiom so that similar group outcomes will be non-discriminatory p Using independence thus also reflects the assumption that WAECS holds so IF independence should be used THEN WAECS We follow the second part of the rule as follows Proposition IF independence should be used THEN there is MB AND WAECS Merging the rules Figure shows both rules and the implications of not following them otherwise discrimination there is MB AND WAECS otherwise unfairness independence should be used Figure Friedler et als rules for choosing independence Note that x THEN y is equivalent to saying IF x THEN y AND IF y THEN x We can therefore merge Proposition and Proposition as follows Proposition there is MB AND WAECS THEN independence should be used To illustrate this rule let us consider the hiring example introduced in Section We first assume that if we split the pool of candidates into demographic groups then all groups are on average equal in their qualifications eg their ability to sell the hiring companys product Second we assume that standardized test scores What we mean here is we assume that there is MB For brevity however we will simply write there is MB from now on Again we will write WAECS to say we assume that WAECS We can find similar interpretations of Friedler et als rules in the literature eg in While there are subtle differences between their interpretations and ours which we lack the space to discuss here in detail we will show in Section that whichever interpretation of Friedler et als rules is chosen still falls short of justifying statistical parity as a general rule shown on the candidates CVs distort their actual qualifications To illustrate such a case of MB Friedler et al recite research which calls into question the validity of standardized tests to assess verbal aptitude across different racial groups In this case independence should be enforced as both WAECS and MB are given Note though that the given reasons for enforcing or not enforcing independence fairness and non-discrimination are by definition purely mathematical not moral However the terms still imply philosophical meaning Lipton and Steinhardt refer to the naming of technical concepts with terms that are colloquially used as suggestive definitions These terms carry meaning in dayto-day life and therefore imply that our intuitive understanding of these terms in some way aligns with their technical definition This raises the question of whether these terms aim at not only providing a purely statistical reasoning about independence but also a moral one As demonstrated above if we interpret the paper literally then it only provides mathematical justifications for the introduced rule However since the includes predictions that are used to make potentially life-altering decisions it is hard to see how the rule could only be concerned with the mathematical validity of the predictions without any further moral considerations In the next section we will therefore consider the natural extension of Proposition We will view it as providing moral reasons for/against enforcing independence In doing so we must consider all spaces introduced in Section The moral rules that we introduce therefore include not only WAECS and MB but also WAEPS and LB DEALING WITH LB As we have shown the literal interpretation of the WAE worldview states that all groups are actually the same in the even though it may look differently when taking measurements We should however consider what follows from assuming the WAE worldview at the PS level while allowing for the existence of LB Clearly the result may be that we are no longer all equal in the since LB may affect members of different groups in different ways Two Ways of Dealing With LB in Distilled Rules We will now discuss how LB may be included in the rules proposed by Friedler et al The first way of dealing with LB in Proposition is to preserve the rule and simply apply it the same way when there is LB This approach does not consider morality and instead prioritizes Friedler et als original reasoning about mathematical properties These properties are what fairness in its moral sense is ultimately reduced to when dealing with LB this way The second way of including LB in the rule is to extend it and make the argument a moral one For this we extend the rule to the new type of bias LB by arguing by analogy one could reason that LB in terms of its moral features is sufficiently similar to MB so that similar rules follow when there is LB instead of MB or both Indeed the analogy between MB and LB will be stronger if we can identify a common moral principle that applies to both cases Let us now examine both ways for dealing with LB in turn Binnss interpretation in considers this moralized version The mathematical extension Under this extension we simply apply the rules that we distilled from Friedler et als framework independently of whether there is LB or not Proposition states that there is MB AND WAECS THEN independence should be used In order to see how this rule plays out when there is LB we consider the case where WAEPS and inequalities in the are caused by LB This means that by hypothesis NOT WAECS It follows from Proposition that independence should not be used in this case The reasoning consistent with Friedler et al would be If WAECS is not assumed enforcing independence violates Friedler et als mathematical fairness property that individuals close in the should be close in the independently of whether they are equal in the PS or not This line of argument may however leave scholars that are interested in fairness in its moral sense not Friedler et als statistical concept dissatisfied The moral extension In the argument in favor of fairness does not provide an explicit moral grounding to define fairness the way it is defined This definition of fairness is explicitly inspired by Dwork et als notion which relies on similarity in the to determine what makes a decision fair However it may be objected that similarities in the under the influence of injustice do not provide a suitable reference point to define what is a fair prediction or decision To see this let us consider the case of credit lending described by Reuben Binns in We assume that we observe in the OS that women have historically been less likely to repay their loans than men Binns provides two possible reasons for this The first is that credit lenders may be more lenient towards men allowing them delays in their repayment This can be interpreted as MB Women and men who are equally good at repaying their loans end up with different credit histories which are proxies for their repayment ability as men are treated preferentially A second reason could be that women are more likely to be single parents which makes the repayment of credits more difficult This is an example of LB Due to societal structures the average woman is less likely to repay her loan The question is then whether differences in the OS between men and women ie their credit histories should be considered to be just Binns argues that if they are not considered to be just eg because they are unjustly caused by gendered social structures then enforcing independence should be considered We may argue that both of the given reasons for the difference in the payment history the existence of MB and LB are unjust First we could say that it is unjust and not merely inefficient for a decision about the individual to be taken when MB exists Second we may argue that it is unjust and not merely inefficient for a decision about the individual to be taken when LB exists This suggests that there is a common moral reason for why decisions influenced by MB or LB are unfair We will now attempt to identify this common moral cause For this we will follow the philosophical analysis which is explicitly invoked by Binns This analysis will explain why both MB and LB cause unfair predictions and decisions It appeals to the question of responsibility which asks whether individuals are responsible for predictions others make about them that impact their well-being This responsibility may fail to obtain either because the measurements that decision-makers have the OS do not reflect peoples choices ie people are not responsible for MB or because the construct that is measured the does not reflect peoples choices or both Thus one should ask whether the OS or the is the result of choices or of circumstances individuals cannot control When MB exists the individuals who are judged in a biased manner do not control the bias and are not morally responsible for it Intuitively it is unfair that individuals are imposed costs due to factors for which they are not responsible We can thus describe the moral view behind proposition Proposition in the following way if WAECS and MB is assumed then differences in the are unjust on responsibility grounds Similarly one may consider peoples actual abilities and behaviors as responses to the peculiar circumstances in which people happen to be born and grow up which are not up to them Thus people are not responsible for the influence of those peculiar circumstances ie for their LB It follows that people should not benefit or get harmed or more generally be treated differently because of LB which manifests itself in the Hence by parity of reasoning according to the above moral interpretation of Proposition if we seek to eliminate the influence of MB on the decision we should also seek to eliminate the influence of LB on the decision Conclusion of the moral extension This suggests the following view as the natural extension of Proposition ie the view that there is MB AND WAECS THEN independence should be used Proposition WAEPS AND there is MB OR there is LB THEN independence should be used Not All LB Should Be Corrected Intuitively Proposition states that independence is called for not only to correct for MB but also to correct for LB Notice that Proposition is now arguably too broad in the inequalities it promises to correct for The moral argument for removing the influence of MB was that it was neither morally neutral nor merely inefficient but actually unjust as it does not reflect merit or responsibility Something similar intuitively must hold in this case Namely it is unjust LB that calls for some kind of correction or rectification Distinction between just and unjust LB Note that it is a logical possibility that indeed all LB as such is unjust If so there is no distinction between unjust LB and LB simpliciter This is the position that no one deserves the values in the which are influenced by any type of LB It is however also possible to maintain a more nuanced view It is easy to show this by considering theories of justice that political philosophers actually defend Different substantive theories of justice provide different and often irreconcilable criteria for evaluating the justice of social structures For example In addition in the case of MB but not LB a distinct moral argument can be given as to why a decision affected by MB is unfair which is based on merit The conventional view of merit is that it is based on what people do for example their contribution to society Suppose that the actual contribution to society of two people A and B is equal that is A and B have the same features However MB exists so A is perceived to contribute more and consequently A receives a benefit that is denied to B This is intuitively unfair since A does not deserve a favorable treatment compared to B A has not contributed more to society than B When using OR we are referring to the logical operator which means that the statement is true if either one or both operands are true institutional luck egalitarianism maintains that all inequalities in the metric of what matters ultimately for justice eg well-being for which individuals are not responsible are unjust Unjust inequalities are the ones which could have been prevented or redressed through suitable and feasible institutional arrangements Rawlss theory of justice on the other hand maintains that inequalities reflecting peoples unequal native endowments and motivations are just provided that they are not influenced by the social class of birth and emerge through institutions arranged in a way that delivers the greatest expectations of social primary goods to societys least advantaged members These theories and many others disagree when arguing about the justice of institutions The luck egalitarian one for example commits the government to do everything it can to level the playing field among individuals born with unequal natural endowments as these inequalities are undeserved Rawlss view however approves of such inequalities if they boost productivity in a society where people at the bottom of the social pyramid are the ones to benefit the most from such productivity gains Yet these views also converge on many real world cases for example current US society is arguably very unjust according to both views From the perspective of both luck egalitarianism and Rawlss theory of justice many inequalities in the which are produced by LB actually reflect unjust social structures They are instances of unjust LB Notice that neither theory implies that all LB is unjust LB Let us consider the luck egalitarian view that only factors for which one can be held morally responsible justify inequality It may still be objected that the development of innate potential into realized abilities is not determined entirely by external circumstances that are matters of brute good or bad luck Apart from the influence of good and ill fortune our realized abilities reflect our personal history ie the choices we make every day If human agency is not an illusion we are partially at least responsible for at least some of our choices Therefore at least some LB is not morally problematic It is therefore unclear why one should treat inequalities arising in the as a result of such LB on a par with inequalities arising in the OS due to MB Just LB at group-level In the discussion above we are saying that not all LB is necessarily unjust because some LB might simply be caused by personal choices However one may question whether it is possible for personal choices to cause unequal outcomes not only between individuals but also at the group level even if there were no inequalities in the PS For example two people with the same potential with institutions that only let inequalities reflecting their individual choices exist could still end up with different realized abilities Yet on a group level it seems improbable that one group justly has a statistical prevalence of individuals making one kind of choices for which they can be held responsible and another group justly has a statistical prevalence of individuals making a different kind of choice If that different prevalence exists and we assume WAEPS certainly there must be something causing the group inequality for which individuals cannot and shall not be held responsible The question is therefore whether just LB is actually possible on a group-level which is the relevant level when talking about enforcing independence In reply there are at least two ways of showing the possibility of just LB First we consider moral views that differ from luck egalitarianism Consider the view that the influence of parents who read bedtime stories to their children and in this way cause unequal IQ ie differences in the OS is never unjust a view that contradicts luck egalitarianism If that view is correct inequalities that have been created by reading bedtime stories to children are not unjust even if it so happens that for historical and cultural reasons reading bedtime stories to children is more habitual in certain cultures than others Second just LB may exist under a luck egalitarian view if we do not assume WAEPS Let us consider the case of a genetic disease which is more common in a specific population due to the founder effect Spending more resources on the detection and treatment of this disease for the population that is most affected eg more medical check-ups financial support for therapies is by definition a form of LB This is because if we assumed WAEPS investing more in the detection and treatment of this disease for people in the particularly affected population is the sort of circumstance that would create inequalities in the ie the rest of the population would on average suffer more from the effects of the disease However in a world in which we are not all equal in the PS as is the case with this genetic disease the increased spending on the more affected population could plausibly be seen as a case of just LB Under a luck egalitarian view of justice for example this LB would clearly be just because it mitigates an inequality in the for which individuals are not morally responsible ie that without intervention one group is more likely to suffer from the disease When LB exists but is not unjust the moral reason for enforcing independence no longer holds In other words the decision whether independence should be used depends not only on facts but also on values when LB exists According to luck egalitarianism independence is not required if the following two requirements are fulfilled unequal decisions ie inequality in the emerge purely as a result of unbiased observations ie WYSIWYG of the features that we want to base the decision on ie and these features are unequally distributed in spite of equality of potential in the PS simply as a result of choices for which individuals can be considered fully responsible According to other theories of justice independence is not required if the features in question emerge as a result of processes such as reading bedtime stories to ones children Whether independence should be enforced or not thus depends on ones view of what LB is just Understanding this difference between just and unjust LB can help us understand how our extension of Friedler et als framework relates to Mitchell et als proposition to differentiate between two notions of biased data statistical bias and societal bias Statistical bias occurs between what they refer to as the world as it is ie the and the world according to data ie the OS It is thus simply another term for MB Societal bias is introduced from the world as it should and could be to the world as it is One may think that the world as it should and could be is equivalent to our PS and that societal bias is thus equivalent to LB However the PS is a purely descriptive notion while the world as it should and could be while never defined suggests a normative concept To define what the world ought to look like a philosophical concept is needed Such a philosophical concept might morally require the introduction of just LB that ensures that the world as it is reflects the world as it should and could be In this case our reading of Mitchell et al is that there is no societal bias whereas our model would note that there is LB but that this LB is just Our extension thus gives us the tools to describe the existence LB without yet making normative judgments about it Such normative judgments are only required when differentiating just from unjust LB Extended Rules Final Formulation We have argued that if we consider LB we should consider a moralized version of the relation between LB and independence ie not all forms of LB require to be corrected As we have shown the theory of justice one adheres to determines ones judgment about the justness of the LB This in turn determines ones judgment as to whether LB provides a reason to enforce independence or not In conclusion the most charitable interpretation of the extension of Proposition to include LB is not Proposition but rather the following more nuanced view Proposition WAEPS AND there is MB OR there is unjust LB THEN independence should be used In what follows we will consider Proposition as a natural extension of Proposition However we want to focus our attention on the implications of Proposition in the scenario in which MB does not exist in order to simplify our discussion somewhat We will refer to the remaining underlying assumptions as the Were All Equal But There Is Injustice WAEBI worldview Definition WAEBI worldview The WAEBI worldview subsumes the following assumptions WAEPS and there is unjust LB Proposition follows from Proposition if it is assumed that there is no MB Proposition WAEBI THEN independence should be used In the hiring example WAEBI is given if for example at birth all demographic groups have the same average potential to become hire-worthy sales people but this equality is lost because one group has on average less money and is thus more likely to have to work odd jobs instead of doing unpaid internships The resulting differences in the candidates qualifications and proxies like their CV are thus considered to be unjust and should be corrected by enforcing independence TWO COUNTEREXAMPLES AGAINST EXTENDED RULES We will now examine if Proposition holds up as a general rule for when to enforce independence Clearly it does not represent a general rule if we can find cases in which this rule does not apply The goal of this section is to see if we can find such cases As stated before we focus our search for counterexamples on Proposition which simplifies the discussion of Proposition Proposition is the claim that WAEBI THEN independence should be used When we assume that there is no MB Proposition is true if and only if Proposition is true Thus we can simplify the analysis of Proposition somewhat by focusing on Proposition assuming that no MB exists We shall proceed in a logical fashion by investigating the two parts of the biconditional in turn IF WAEBI THEN independence should be used and Note that this second assumption logically leads to the assumption of unjust inequalities in the IF independence should be used THEN WAEBI Notice that rule is informative even though we already know that it is incorrect because independence should also be used when MB exists even if WAEBI is not assumed The reason why it is still informative is that we will show that the claim is incorrect independently of MB We argue against both rule and by counterexample The counterexamples will show not only that Proposition is incorrect but also that Proposition is since the counterexamples do not involve MB Thus we refer to Proposition so that we can bracket the issue of MB and avoid distractions Counterexample Against Rule IF WAEBI THEN independence should be used It is now time to offer a convincing counterexample to the view that absent MB independence should be enforced if WAEBI For this recall the definition of WAEBI Definition which states that this worldview assumes WAEPS and unjust LB The counterexample is a case in which the WAEBI assumptions are all satisfied yet independence is not required One can build a counterexample as follows First let us suppose that there is a specific severe congenital disorder that is very painful and drastically reduces the individuals life expectancy We will refer to this specific severe congenital disorder as SCD Let us further assume that probably contrary to fact all individuals are generally equally at risk of being born with SCD WAEPS is therefore satisfied Second let us suppose that while the risk for being born with SCD is generally the same for all individuals this risk is notably increased when the mother breathes in dangerous pollutants during pregnancy Assume now that mothers in one group eg the green group are more likely to live in neighborhoods close to chemical factories that emit dangerous pollutants Individuals in the green group are thus more likely to be exposed to the risk of developing SCD We shall suppose that this unequal exposure is produced by huge and uncontroversial injustices in society Green mothers might for example be more likely to live in poverty because of direct discrimination against them which makes their opportunities for all sorts of job worse than those of the orange group For this reason they cannot afford moving and have to live in poor neighborhoods plagued by dangerous pollutants This case plausibly counts as injustice even according to more moderate forms of egalitarianism than luck egalitarianism Hence there is unjust LB Third as a result of members of the green group are more likely to suffer from SCD than members of the orange group Thus there is an unjust inequality in the We shall suppose that whether a patient suffers from SCD is a clear cut binary condition ie either someone does or does not There are no intermediate stages Suppose that a very expensive therapy is developed which cures people with SCD but causes recurrent migraine with moderate frequency let us say once per month As SCD has bad consequences for the individual pain drastically shortened life we shall assume that the benefits of the therapy outweigh its costs Suppose now that the therapy only works if it affects fetal development Thus in order to avoid the disease for the future individual it is the mother that has to be treated before the illness is fully manifested in the child Suppose that machine learning specialists develop a perfect accuracy predictor to determine based on a non-invasive clinical examination whether the fetus will be ill This may be impossible in practice However in a philosophical argument we can test the theory also with hypothetical examples The challenge is to explain what could be morally wrong with the independence-fulfilling predictor Notice also that in the clinical setting one can already make high accuracy predictions With close to perfect accuracy people often act and reason as if the accuracy was perfect Since the predictor is perfectly accurate it will predict SCD at a higher rate for the green than for the orange patients As a result green patients will receive the therapy more often than orange patients do which violates independence We will now argue that this perfect accuracy predictor is perfectly just The argument we present is very robust because it is coherent with ethical views that sometimes pull in different directions and intuitively it is difficult to make the case that the argument is wrong Indeed it should be so obvious that the predictor is fair that it would be counted against any view entailing the opposite for this case that it cannot align with this result The decision of the perfect predictor is perfectly fair because no individual has a claim against the distribution based on it By no individual has a claim we do not mean that some individual may have a prima facie claim that a different decision should be taken which is then overridden by the claims of others We also do not mean that some individual has a claim that holds prima facie but that is defeated by some substantive view of justice which the individual if reasonable or endowed with moral sensibility should respect even if it is not in the individuals own interest to respect it What we actually mean by no individual has a claim is the much more radical claim that the individual has no claim against the perfectly accurate distribution in this case not even a pro tanto or a prima facie claim To see why no individual has a claim against the perfect accuracy distribution consider that no individual faced with the decision by a perfect predictor can point to an alternative distribution that they have any reason to prefer This clearly is the case in the example For first each individual person who will develop SCD is better off with a decision based on the correct prediction because the individual is certain to receive the cure which is the preferable outcome despite the side effects Second every individual who will not develop SCD is better off without the therapy because the individual is certain to not need the cure Not receiving the therapy is thus the preferable outcome as it avoids the side effects As a consequence no one has a claim to a different decision Moreover any departure from the perfect accuracy predictor makes someone worse off and no one better off When the features in the are not equally distributed between the two groups It may be objected that this is a very peculiar example and that not all cases involving perfect accuracy predictors are relevantly similar That is probably correct However one case is all it takes to generate a counterexample that falsifies a general claim about when independence should be used ie green and orange in this case enforcing independence sacrifices some accuracy Suppose that this sacrifice amounts to a single wrong diagnosis That means either someone who will actually develop SCD will not receive the cure or someone who will not develop SCD will receive the cure Either way the choice to enforce independence will cause harm to at least one individual which gives that individual a claim against independence It seems that this is one rare case in which one view of what is fair is truly robust because besides maximizing utility no individual has a claim against the perfect accuracy predictor even if it violates independence Furthermore if independence is enforced in this case even though it causes inaccuracy there will be at least one individual who has a moral claim against independence being enforced This claim entails that enforcing independence is morally wrong because it is not defeated by any claim in favor of enforcing independence The question of comparing the relative urgency or strength of moral claims does not even arise Our argument here is not merely that independence in this case involves a loss of accuracy and thus utility and that simply for that reason is the morally wrong choice in this case While it is correct that there is a conflict between independence and accuracy in this case our argument is much stronger than the usual utilitarian argument The usual utilitarian argument points out that enforcing independence causes a loss of aggregate utility This argument also focuses on utility but it considers it from the perspective of each and every individual involved in the decision A utilitarian argument would object that enforcing independence causes a utility loss in the aggregate and that for that reason it should not be done However such an argument also requires that in order to reach the utilitarian maximum some people are made worse off for the benefit of other people The utilitarian view is that this is always morally right when the sum of utility is maximized Many people find this view objectionable eg The objection against the utilitarian is that it does not respect the separateness of persons Our argument against independence does not imply the utilitarian conclusion so it is is not vulnerable to this objection Summing up it is not true that IF WAEBI THEN independence should be used In this case WAEBI is clearly satisfied by hypothesis and yet independence should not be used Counterexample Against Rule IF independence should be used THEN WAEBI Now let us turn to the other direction of the biconditional which is the idea that IF independence should be used THEN WAEBI is assumed A counterexample to this would be a case in which independence seems intuitively fair or called for yet WAEBI conditions are not satisfied Unfortunately this example is not as robust as the first one is The example itself is inspired by a fairness theory for machine learning which is based on economic and political theories of equality of opportunity and which provides indications for when independence should be used We do not rely on this Our argument is a contractualist one not a utilitarian one Our thesis that the perfect accuracy predictor is just is so robust because it is independently supported by contractualism and utilitarianism theory as we find that a strong case can be made for the conclusion on intuitive grounds We consider the design of an algorithmic decision system deployed after natural disasters This decision system is tasked with determining where drones should be sent in order to attempt to rescue civilians from drowning after their houses and streets have been flooded Data scientists train a machine learning model to decide where to send the drones in such cases The initial goal is to simply maximize the number of lives saved Let us assume that there is a flooding which affects a city with its surrounding suburbs While the city is densely populated the suburbs are not We can split the population into two demographic groups the green and the orange group It turns out that the orange group tends to live in the city and the green group tends to live in the suburbs Because of the difference in population density between the city and the suburbs a drone that is sent to the city has a much higher probability of resulting in a successful rescue Hence the utility-maximizing model is more likely to send drones to the densely populated city than to the suburbs it diverts resources to the suburbs only when a large proportion in the cities has been saved As a consequence the probability to be saved is much higher say ten times higher if you are orange This means that members of the green population are very unlikely to be rescued We maintain that in this case independence is morally required The reasoning is the following Every individual equally needs to be saved independently of where they live and no one should be held morally responsible for failing to live in a relatively densely populated area for matters of life and death Thus in a sense everyone equally deserves to be saved If everyone equally deserves to be rescued everyone should have the same prospects of being rescued independently of their sex race or any other sensitive attribute If so any inequality in the probability of rescue associated with membership to a group is morally problematic for it cannot be justified based on merit or need or responsibility It may be objected that there is a clear moral reason to prioritize saving urban individuals namely that this will maximize the total number of lives rescued and we ought to maximize this value However notice again that this is a utilitarian maximizing argument Most moral problems of fairness in machine learning or at least most morally deep problems emerge because there is a conflict between maximizing utility and fairness in its moral sense defined in a way that is independent from it Hence in a sense the fact that the fairness intuition conflicts with a utilitarian assessment of what should be done is to be expected for an authentic non-utilitarian moral intuition for fairness Arguably the best way to take the utilitarian intuition that there is a moral reason to send drones predominantly into the densely populated areas into account is by viewing it as a consideration of efficiency that an ethically sound procedure should balance with considerations of distributive justice That is the all-things-considered morally desirable algorithm will neither be one that maximizes utility nor one that achieves independence fully but rather something in between that will compromise utility to some extent but also achieve a more balanced rescue of Clearly we assume here that data scientists cannot reach or even approximate a perfect accuracy predictor This implies that when the algorithm predicts that a person will be saved by sending a helicopter to coordinates it is not always the case that someone will get rescued particularly in the suburbs the two populations We then conclude that this is a case in which independence should be used due to a concern with fairness in its moral sense Even if let us grant the objection not fully achieved as fairness needs to be balanced with efficiency Having argued that independence should be used this amounts to the counterexample we are looking for if we show that the moral case for independence is independent of the WAEBI conditions For building the stronger possible case we shall suppose that every single one of the conditions that jointly define the WAEBI worldview is false First we do not assume that WAEPS that is people are born with a disposition to live in cities or suburbs For example some people live in the city just because they are born there even if it is not true of everyone Second it is not the case that LB exists or at least the plausibility of the conclusion about fairness does not depend on the existence of LB We may consider for the sake of the argument a society in which people are not pressured to live in cities The case for rescuing the people in the suburbs is as strong in a society in which people are not pressured to live in cities as it is in one in which they are pressured to do so among other things by the perception that their lives have less value in the eyes of rescue drones if they remain in less densely populated areas So the conclusion does not depend on the existence of LB Third we may as well suppose that there is LB but the LB is not unjust For example people end up living in suburbs and cities and different groups eg green and orange have different propensities to do so but this is not in itself unjust or the result of injustice in society Schellings model of segregation shows that a mild preference for living among members of the same group will over time lead to segregation For this example we assume that the green and orange population have a slight preference for members of their own group and that this preference is innate and not caused by injustices Over time the two groups have segregated to some extent so that the majority of the people living in the city happens to be orange and the majority of the people living in the suburbs is green In conclusion we have identified a case in which independence should plausibly be used And yet in this case the conditions realizing the WAEBI worldview are not satisfied This counts as a counterexample to the claim that IF independence should be used THEN WAEBI and concludes our rebuttal of the biconditional claim Proposition Since neither example depends on the existence of MB the arguments also disprove Proposition CONCLUSION In this paper we have analyzed one argument that can be given in support of enforcing independence in a machine learning model found in the recent machine learning literature This argument claims that one shall enforce independence ie use it as a fairness constraint of the model if and only if Were All Equal WAE and there is Measurement Bias MB We have introduced the concept of Lifes Bias LB as a type of bias which influences how the potential an individual is born with develops into realized abilities This bias can be distinguished from the MB proposed by Friedler et al They For examples of unjust causes of segregation see call this type of bias structural bias This shows that the WAE view as stated in the literature is incomplete as demographic groups can be equal not only with respect to their realized abilities but also their potential We have identified two possible extensions of the argument presented in the literature which are relevant when inequalities are generated by LB We argue that the most morally plausible extension is the view that one should enforce independence if and only if there is MB or if Were All Equal But There Is Injustice WAEBI In other words it seems like independence could be justified when taking on the WAEBI worldview which assumes that socio-demographic groups have similar innate potential at birth but unjust LB leads to differences in their realized abilities Unfortunately we found two powerful counterexamples to this ideally simple view the first clearly showed that unjust LB does not always morally require enforcing independence the second made it plausible that even in the absence of MB injustice is not required for the use of independence to be morally justified The relatively simple and morally plausible proposition linking WAEBI and independence we analyzed here is thus not universally true One may object to the first counterexample saying that it presents a case where what is being distributed is not uniformly beneficial that is the treatment would be a net harm for many of the subjects However it is true of many cases discussed in the algorithmic fairness debate that what is being distributed is not uniformly beneficial arguably even being admitted to a university that is too demanding for ones skills might be harmful and being released on parole may not be beneficial for the parolee who in fact re-offends and re-enters prison with a worse criminal record One may further object that in the first counterexample considering efficiency alone would produce a fair outcome We argue that if there are cases in which the efficient solution is clearly and intuitively considered the fair solution we need a philosophical theory that can explain why this is in fact the case Our argument thus reveals that a promising line of research may be built by judging the morality of fairness metrics not only based on the question of what causes differences in predictions but also based on how these predictions distribute utility
