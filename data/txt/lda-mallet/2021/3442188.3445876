Group Fairness Independence Revisited This paper critically examines arguments against independence a measure of group fairness also known as statistical parity and as demographic parity In recent discussions of fairness in computer science some have maintained that independence is not a suitable measure of group fairness This position is at least partially based on two influential papers Dwork et al Hardt et al that provide arguments against independence We revisit these arguments and we find that the case against independence is rather weak We also give arguments in favor of independence showing that it plays a distinctive role in considerations of fairness Finally we discuss how to balance different fairness considerations CONCEPTS Social and professional topics User characteristics

INTRODUCTION Measures of group fairness have become an important topic in computer science after the publication of the ProPublica article Machine Bias ProPublica found that the risk assessment tool COMPAS is biased against black people in having unbalanced false positive and false negative rates This is intuitively unfair The ensuing debate mostly focused on the contrast between the measure implicitly used by ProPublica now known as separation and other measures in particular a measure known as sufficiency However a third measure of group fairness independence also known as statistical parity or demographic parity has been viewed more critically Some computer scientists seem to think that independence is not a suitable measure of group fairness others maintain that while independence is adequate in some contexts it leads to undesirable consequences in others The critical stance of computer scientist with respect to independence appears to be at least partially based on two influential papers that provide arguments against independence Here we revisit and critically examine these arguments and we find that the case against independence as opposed to other measures of group fairness is rather weak We first introduce measures of group fairness and their most important properties section In particular we introduce the concept of conservative fairness measures which allows us to clarify the relation between fairness and accuracy We then examine the arguments against independence section We find that first arguments against independence proposed in equally apply to other measures of group fairness such as sufficiency and separation and should therefore not be taken to apply to independence specifically Second we argue that arguments against independence proposed in are flawed in making unwarranted assumptions about conservative fairness measures such as sufficiency and separation We prove that sufficiency and separation are not incrementally conservative which means that these measures are not necessarily preserved if we increase the accuracy of a predictor We then state arguments in favor of independence section finding that independence captures aspects of fairness not covered by sufficiency and separation Finally we discuss how to balance different fairness considerations section FAIRNESS MEASURES DEFINITIONS AND PROPERTIES This section introduces and discusses the most important measures of group fairness formulates these measures for the case of binary variables and discusses other relevant fairness measures setting the stage for the discussion in later sections Definitions of Group Fairness Here we state the most important group fairness measures following the discussion in These measures are formulated using random variables all measures we consider correspond to statistical properties of these variables The variables have the following interpretation is the true label ie the characteristic that we want to predict is the prediction which can be the output of an algorithm is the characteristic indicating group membership ie the property with respect to which we investigate fairness In the context of supervised learning we have access to through labeled data We will mostly focus on binary variables Also we will assume that a prediction leads to a corresponding decision Let us illustrate this setup using the example of college admissions College students of different genders apply for college a prediction about their suitability is made based on the application documents In this case the value of corresponds to the actual suitability of a student applying for college is known if the data in question is historical and the value can be determined based on whether a student actually obtained a degree or not or a different operationalization of suitable applicant corresponds to the prediction whether or not a student should be admitted to college based on the application documents corresponds to the gender of applicants which we assume to be binary for simplicitys sake To formulate fairness measures we will use the following notation Two random variables are independent if we will write this Two random variables are conditionally independent given if we will write this as Definition The measure of independence is satisfied if Independence also known as statistical parity and demographic parity means that the prediction does not depend on If independence is satisfied a prediction is statistically balanced between different groups in that members of the different groups get predictions at the same rate In the case of college admissions this means that an equal proportion of men and women applying for college are predicted to be suitable applicants Definition The measure of sufficiency is satisfied if Sufficiency means that given the prediction the true label is independent of the group The idea is that the prediction contains all the information about the true label so the sensitive characteristic is not needed in other words the prediction is sufficient for In the case of college admissions this means that an equal proportion of men and women predicted to be suitable applicants are actually suitable applicants Definition The measure of separation is satisfied if Separation means that given the true label the prediction is independent of the group The idea is that the prediction can only vary with respect to different groups insofar as this is justified by the true label see In the case of college admissions this means that an equal proportion of suitable men and women applying for admission are predicted to be suitable applicants Properties and Relations In this section we discuss some important properties of the fairness measures introduced above The discussion follows see the appendix for proofs First the accuracy of a predictor is the degree Sufficiency is closely related to calibration Calibration means that the predicted store reflects the true score Calibration and sufficiency are equivalent up to reparametrization cf p to which it agrees with the true label a perfect predictor is a predictor that completely agrees with the true label ie Next we state an important property that is shared by sufficiency and separation but not by independence Proposition If we have a perfect predictor then sufficiency and separation hold Independence is not in general compatible with a perfect predictor independence and perfect predictors are only compatible if the true label is evenly distributed between groups ie if we have which is not the case in general Proposition motivates a definition that will be important in the following It is a distinction between different kinds of group fairness measures Definition A fairness measure is conservative if the measure is necessarily satisfied in the case of a perfect predictor Otherwise a fairness criterion is non-conservative Fairness measures are called conservative because in the case of a perfect predictor they do not force us to change anything to obtain fairness ie they conserve the status quo Proposition shows that both sufficiency and separation are conservative fairness criteria meanwhile independence is not Note that the reverse implication of proposition is false The following proposition provides a characterization of when sufficiency and separation holds in some cases of non-perfect predictors Proposition If the joint distribution of is positive for all values then sufficiency and separation hold at the same time is independent of the joint distribution of and ie if This proposition is important because it tells us when sufficiency and separation hold under reasonable circumstances such as a non-vanishing joint distribution The notion of a conservative fairness measure is very strong and of limited practical relevance because predictors are hardly ever perfect in practice To overcome this limitation we can define a broader notion of conservativeness and investigate if relevant fairness measures are conservative on this notion Definition A fairness measure is incrementally conservative if the degree to which the measure is satisfied does not decrease if we increase the accuracy of the predictor Are the fairness measures we considered above conservative according to this broader notion Unfortunately this is not the case In the appendix the following proposition is proved Proposition Sufficiency and separation are not incrementally conservative fairness measures This means that if these two measures are satisfied by a certain non-perfect predictor and we increase the accuracy of that predictor it can happen that the improved predictor no longer satisfies the two measures Thus the property of conservativeness does not imply incremental conservativeness it is not necessarily the case that if we increase the accuracy of a predictor a conservative fairness measure is preserved The notion of a conservative fairness measure used here is related to the concept of conservative justice Sec insofar as the latter notion concerns the preservation of factual practices however the notion of conservativeness proposed here does not concern the preservation of norms as required by conservative justice Confusion Matrices In this section we discuss group fairness measures in the case of binary prediction ground truth and characteristic using so-called confusion matrices Confusion matrices make it easier to formulate and reason about these measures in concrete applications The discussion in this section draws on more thorough expositions of confusion matrices and their characteristics in Assume we have collected statistical information for binary and for example historical records of college success as well as the binary prediction for admission The prediction can be positive or negative and for either outcome it can match the true label of true positives of true negatives or be mistaken of false positives of false negatives Based on these records we can compile a confusion matrix true label Y positive negative total prediction R positive negative total On this basis we can define some important statistics of confusion matrices Accuracy Positive Predictive Value PPV Negative Predictive Value NPV False Positive Rate FPR False Negative Rate FNR From here on we assume that we have observed sufficiently many cases such that the observations relative frequencies in our tables approximately match the true probabilities Now in order to formulate fairness measures for confusion matrices we need one matrix for each of two groups values of the random variable truth Y R Table Group Ap truth Y R Table Group Based on this the three group fairness measures defined in the previous section can be formulated in terms of statistics of these two confusion matrices Proposition For binary variables independence is equivalent to Proposition For binary variables sufficiency holds both groups have the same positive predictive value PPV ie and the same negative predictive value NPV ie Proposition For binary variables separation holds both groups have the same false positive rate FPR ie and false negative rate FNR ie Other Kinds of Fairness In this section we discuss kinds of fairness that are not group fairness measures but that will play an important role in our discussion below The group fairness measures introduced above are observational measures ie they can be measured based on data that are typically available In may cases we have access to labeled data a predictive model and labels or a different kind of access to the sensitive characteristic of individuals However there are other kinds of fairness considerations that are not measurable in terms of these quantities Kamishima et al propose to distinguish three different kinds of fairness The first kind prejudice subsumes the notions of group fairness discussed above The second kind underestimation is due to the fact that a model may be unfair due to the finiteness of training data The definition of the third kind negative legacy is particularly important Definition Negative legacy is unfairness due to unfair sampling or labeling in the training data Kamishima et al provide the following example of negative legacy If a bank has been unfairly rejecting the loans of the people who should have been approved the labels in the training data would become unfair This problem is serious because it is hard to detect and correct Ibid p Kamishima et al note that the problem can be overcome to a certain extent if an independent set of fairly labeled training data is available A further notion of fairness that is relevant is individual fairness which can be defined as follows Definition Informal Individual fairness is the requirement that a fair predictor should treat similar individuals similarly ie their predictions should be similar Individual fairness is in tension with group fairness measures under certain conditions because group fairness defines fairness in terms of average properties of group members which usually does not do justice to some individual properties of group members In particular if the comparison of individuals uses fine-grained information such as a score or utility it is possible to violate individual fairness while complying with some measure of group fairness We will see examples of this below Finally note that individual fairness seem to be the fairness measure that is most closely related to the philosophical concept of justice cf Sec ARGUMENTS AGAINST INDEPENDENCE SCRUTINIZED In this section we examine arguments against independence from the computer science literature When following the debate one can get the impression that independence is somehow flawed or unsuitable as a measure for group fairness The goal of this section The notion is due to Formally we can make individual fairness precise by replacing the informal notion of similarity with two metrics which capture how similar or close individuals and their predictions are To do this we need a metric between individuals and a metric between distributions of predictions of individuals where is a map from individuals to distributions of predictions To enforce individual fairness we now require that the distance between individuals should limit the distance between the distribution of predictions ie we should have for This is a so-called Lipschitz condition is to revisit and critically examine important arguments against independence Dwork et al The Argument From Gerrymandering The most important paper credited with showing that independence is not a suitable fairness concept is We will reexamine the arguments in this paper and argue that first it is not clear whether Dwork et al wish to reject independence and second that the arguments made by Dwork et al should not be construed as arguments against independence but more broadly as arguments against group fairness in general First let us examine whether Dwork et al wish to simply reject independence Note that Dwork et al call independence statistical parity In the introduction Dwork et al write we demonstrate the inadequacy of statistical parity as a notion of fairness through several examples in which statistical parity is maintained but from the point of view of an individual the outcome is blatantly unfair p This sounds like an outright rejection However later in the paper Dwork et al write that statistical parity is insufficient as a general notion of fairness p This suggest that Dwork et al merely want to argue that independence statistical parity is not a logically sufficient condition for fairness which is a much weaker claim than the claim that it should be rejected tout court What is more the paper investigates to what extent individual fairness implies or helps satisfy independence which would be unnecessary if independence should be outright rejected Thus Dwork et al merely caution against independence as the sole arbiter of fairness Now let us examine the arguments against independence in Sec more closely The arguments take the form of three examples in which the adoption of independence has undesirable consequences in that independence holds but individuals are treated unfairly that is individual fairness is violated The first example Reduced Utility shows that independence does not ensure that the most suitable candidates from different group are selected In the example an organization hires people from two groups It is possible for the organization to comply with independence while out of ignorance choosing the least qualified members of group and the best qualified members of group This reduces the utility of the organization and it also violates individual fairness because similar members of the two groups are treated differently To make it concrete assume we have two individuals and both similarly qualified and while is hired is not hired thus two individuals who are similar are not treated similarly The second example Self-fulfilling Prophecy has the same structure as the first example but the unqualified members of are now maliciously chosen for the purpose of justifying future discrimination of members of The third example Subset Targeting is based on the fact that independence does not ensure a fair choice within groups in that it does not require that the most deserving members of a group get to see a relevant job ad This implies once more a violation of individual fairness Are these examples by Dwork et al sufficient to reject independence as a criterion of group fairness We grant that independence can decrease utility if utility depends on the degree of accuracy because independence does not depend on and thus also not on accuracy ie how well and match The three examples discussed by Dwork et al are all based on the fact that independence only requires that an equal proportion of two groups get classified in a certain way but does not further specify how individuals within these groups have to be distributed with respect to As a consequence independence does not in general guarantee individual fairness We thus grant that these examples are valid in substance However this is not sufficient to reject independence as opposed to other measures of group fairness such as separation and sufficiency because similar arguments can be directed against these other measures Our argumentative strategy is to make a tu quoque argument If one accepts these arguments against independence then one also has to accept similar arguments against sufficiency and separation We will now give a first example of gerrymandering with separation in which an employer manipulates statistics so as to realize an unequal treatment of groups while maintaining separation Example Gerrymandering With Separation A malicious employer makes hiring decisions There are two groups and for which separation has to be enforced The employer has a preference for people from group Assume that the employer has made provisional hiring decisions that satisfy separation and a confusion matrix according to these hiring decisions has been compiled cf tables and The confusion matrices satisfy separation which implies that we have Assume further that the employer has a reservoir of qualified candidates from group that do not appear in the statistic of the confusion matrix The employer can now hire candidates from that reservoir as long as an appropriate proportion of qualified candidates is rejected ie the employer creates a division into qualified people hired and qualified people rejected such that The new confusion matrices are unchanged except for the entries and which means that the matrices still satisfy separation as can be easily verified However this hiring practice seems to be intuitively unfair towards group and the qualified people from the reservoir who are rejected it can also violate individual fairness because equally suitable candidates from group are not even considered It could be objected that this example is not analogous to the examples by Dwork et al in that here the employer has to keep part of the statistic off the book and add it later However the examples by Dwork et al also make the assumption that there is additional information not captured by the variables relevant to independence It is important to note that this malicious hiring practice would not be possible in the case of independence because in the example the employer drives up the number of employees from group without raising the numbers in the other group and independence enforces exact balance between groups Let us give a second example with a different structure This is an example for gerrymandering with sufficiency and separation Example Gerrymandering With Sufficiency and Separation Assume that an employer has made provisional hiring decisions and compiled two confusion matrices Assume that the confusion matrices for and both do not have any zero entries and that the two confusion matrices have the same entries if they are normalized by and respectively this means that the corresponding joint distribution of is positive everywhere and the joint distribution of is independent of group membership In this case sufficiency and separation are both satisfied according to proposition Now the employer wants to hurt group Under certain circumstances this can be done as follows The employer chooses a member of that is a false negative ie should be hired but is not predicted to be hired If there is a member in group that is a true positive ie should be hired and is predicted to be hired and is more suitable for the job than the malicious employer can simply switch the prediction for and such that becomes a true positive and becomes a false negative The two confusion matrices are unchanged and thus still satisfy sufficiency and separation However individual fairness is violated because a less qualified candidate has been chosen over a more qualified candidate which hurts the group Note that this example also works without assuming malicious intent The situation described arises naturally if an employer has less information about the relative suitability of people from group the employer would then hire a less than optimal selection of candidates from group and thus also not maximize utility This is very similar to the first example by Dwork et al We can conclude that examples of gerrymandering that are similar to those by Dwork et al can be constructed for notions of group fairness such as separation and sufficiency Note that other examples of gerrymandering for sufficiency and separation can be constructed along the lines of the examples given here It could be asked why Dwork et al did not appreciate that their arguments apply to other notions of group fairness as well Here is a plausible explanation Except for independence notions of group fairness such as sufficiency and separation were only discussed more widely after the publication of the seminal ProPublica article which appeared four years after the publication of Thus Dwork et al might have raised their objections against notions of group fairness in general and not just against independence if they had been aware of other notions It should also be noted that the primary focus of Dwork et al is on the notion of individual fairness not on group fairness The paper does examine the relation between individual fairness and independence statistical parity but this is not the center of attention All in all the idea that independence is somehow more problematic than other group fairness criteria which is held in parts of the computer science literature and can at least partially be traced back to Dwork et al may be a historical accident Hardt et al The Argument From Accuracy Other arguments in the computer science literature are targeted more specifically at independence and do not apply to other notions of group fairness such as sufficiency and separation In the authors propose separation as a fairness measure To differentiate separation from independence the authors claim that independence is flawed for two reasons that do not apply to separation The first reason is the kind of argument made in The second reason mention that argument against independence may apply to other statistical fairness measures as well but this is not elaborated why independence is flawed is given in the following quote note that the authors call independence demographic parity and the predictor is denoted demographic parity often cripples the utility that we might hope to achieve Just imagine the common scenario in which the target variable whether an individual actually defaults or not is correlated with Demographic parity would not allow the ideal predictor which can hardly be considered discriminatory as it represents the actual outcome As a result the loss in utility of introducing demographic parity can be substantial p Later the authors note that separation does not have this problem Unlike demographic parity our notion always allows for the perfectly accurate solution Ibid We will now reconstruct the argument in this passage based on the distinctions made in section There are two different readings of the argument The first reading focuses on the relation between accuracy and utility while the second reading focuses on the relation between accuracy and fairness On the first reading the argument can be reconstructed as follows P A perfect predictor maximizes utility P Independence is a non-conservative fairness criterion is not generally compatible with a perfect predictor while separation is a conservative fairness criterion is compatible with a perfect predictor C Therefore independence is not generally compatible with maximal utility while separation is C Therefore separation should be preferred over independence There are two main problems with this argument The first problem is premiss It is not the case that accuracy and utility align necessarily see For one accuracy only captures the state of the world as it is at a certain point in time Thus if we maximize accuracy we maximize utility only with regard to short-term goals To take the example of risk assessment maximizing utility means minimizing current risk This does not take into account the value of changing risk assessment so as to minimize say future risk which can be tied to say racial justice It is explicitly noted in that utility according to present risk scores is immediate utility Furthermore note that if we have a predictor that is not perfect and false positives and false negatives have different utilities we may have to choose a predictor that is even less accurate than to maximize utility The second problem is the step from conclusion to conclusion As is often pointed out in the computer science literature we virtually never have a perfect predictor So we are almost never in a situation where it actually matters that a fairness measure is conservative ie that the measure is compatible with the perfect predictor However if we are almost never in this situation conservativeness is a theoretical concern but practically irrelevant A situation that is practically irrelevant should not guide our choice of fairness measure So there is no practical reason to prefer conservative fairness measures over non-conservative ones It could be thought that the above argument also goes through for broader notions of conservativeness ie that it holds for increments of accuracy if we increase accuracy and this automatically increases the degree to which a fairness measure holds then we do not need a perfect predictor for accuracy to be of practical relevance the two align in increments In fact Hardt et al appear to have an argument along these lines in mind Immediately after the passage quoted above they write Our criterion is easier to achieve the more accurate the predictor is aligning fairness with the central goal in supervised learning of building more accurate predictors p This claim however is false in view of proposition which establishes that it is possible to start with a predictor that satisfies separation increase the accuracy of and obtain a new predictor that no longer satisfies separation Proposition shows that both separation and sufficiency are not incrementally conservative and that therefore an incremental version of the above argument does not support separation or sufficiency as opposed to independence Let us now turn to the second reading of the argument in the quote from Hardt et al which focuses on the relation between accuracy and fairness A perfect predictor is maximally fair because it aligns with the actual outcome Independence is a non-conservative fairness criterion is not generally compatible with a perfect predictor while separation is a conservative fairness criterion is compatible with a perfect predictor C Therefore independence is not generally compatible with a maximally fair predictor while separation is C Therefore separation should be preferred over independence There are again two problems with this argument The first problem the step from the first to the second conclusion was already discussed above we can reasonably doubt the practical relevance of perfect predictors because they are virtually never realized and an incremental version of the argument is demonstrably false The second more fundamental problem is premiss This premiss is unsupported and arguably wrong in general Premiss is problematic both from a philosophical and from a computer science perspective From a computer science perspective there are important aspects of algorithmic fairness that are not captured by group fairness measures and this is well known Take for example the kinds of fairness discussed in see section above Negative legacy is unfairness due to unfair sampling or labeling Consider the case of unfair labeling Unfair labeling means that the distribution is unfair ie the distribution of actual outcomes we measure at a certain point in time favors one of the groups in over another Note that from a conceptual or philosophical point of view it could be worthwhile to explore the case of perfect predictors The argument made here takes the more practical position of computer science that perfect predictors are negligible as a point of departure in a way we consider to be unfair What premiss says is that a perfect predictor is fair because it aligns with the actual outcome ie because we have However only provides a good justification of the fairness of with respect to ie of if the distribution itself is fair which need not be the case if labeling is unfair this is what Kamishima et al point out The distribution can arise through unfair practices historical biases and so on Importantly Kamishima et al also point out that this sort of unfairness is hard to detect or measure if we do not have access to a sample with fair labeling such that we can obtain a fair estimate of But of course just because it can be hard or even impossible to quantify negative legacy does not mean that this quantity is of no ethical import Fairness is completely independent of our ability to measure it Let us illustrate these points with some examples Why should we think that an accurate predictor is fair One of the reasons may be that an accurate predictor aligns with the ground truth And trying to align predictions with the truth should not be considered to be discriminatory this is the point made by Hardt et al in the above quote To address this point recall what truth means in the present context It means that captures what we observe in the world at a certain point For example we observe that people from group in fact get arrested more frequently than people from group we observe that group in fact has more loan applications rejected than group and so on This is what the joint distribution of and captures In other words the distribution is a picture of the status quo However the world as it is at a certain point or the status quo is not a moral category It is just a description of what we find in the world It does not answer the question whether the world as we find it is fair or morally justified Finding the world to be a certain way and inferring from this that the world ought to be this way is committing a fallacy according to some philosophers based on a confusion between facts and values see eg the discussion of the Is-Ought gap in Sec At this point it could be objected that in some cases the distribution of labels does have moral import Take for example the often-mentioned case of violent offenders If the distribution captures the historical record of reoffending of violent criminals in the past then it makes sense to align our predictor with It seems that we cannot just ignore the historical record in favor of a group fairness measure such as independence The price we pay by releasing potentially violent criminals from one group or by locking up potentially innocent members of the other group because these groups have different frequencies with respect to seems very high and the choice of such a predictor seems morally wrong A form of this argument is made in the following passage of p Independence has been criticized because it can lead to highly undesirable decisions for individuals Dwork et al One might incarcerate Muslims who pose no public safety risk so that the same proportions of Muslims and Christians are released on parole The response to this objection is that it is perfectly possible that ignoring the status quo has undesirable moral consequences as in the case of violent offenders However this does not invalidate the point that the status quo in itself does not have moral status It just means that the status quo can impact considerations of fairness in some cases and that we may have to weight the moral consequences of sticking to or deviating from the status quo against other considerations of fairness We will turn to a discussion of how this could be achieved in the next section ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF INDEPENDENCE So far we have examined arguments against independence and we have found that the case against independence is not as clear cut as some of the computer science literature suggests In this section we turn to the case for independence Why is independence a good or useful fairness measure We compare independence to other notions of group fairness to highlight its usefulness but also its limitations Our goal is not to recapitulate the philosophical literature that supports independence Rather our goal is to establish some connections between philosophical concerns and the more formal discussion in computer science Independence is defined as that is probabilistic independence of group membership and prediction Note that in practice it makes sense to not require strict independence but an approximate version of independence One justification of independence is that it controls and potentially compensates for historical injustice One manifestation of historical injustice is what Kamishima et al call negative legacy viz a distribution that we consider to be unjust The distribution can be unjust because it does not adequately represent the true properties of the groups involved this would correspond to unfair sampling in which case we may not know the true distribution or because the distribution does represent the true properties of the groups involved but these properties themselves did not come about in a fair way this would correspond to unfair labeling Formally negative legacy can manifest as a correlation between group membership and ground truth ie if the groups should have equal access to the outcome encoded by there should be no correlation between group membership and outcome ie we should have Note that as in the case of independence we can formulate an approximate version of this requirement Now if we build a predictor with a focus on accuracy as it is usually the case we get ie the predictor is approximately accurate However this also implies that the predictor does not satisfy an approximate version of independence Thus independence helps us detect this form of historical injustice and it suggests that we modify such that approximately we obtain This modification of may also influence negative legacy in the long run by moving the distribution closer to the desired over time such that accuracy and independence align naturally This is one argument in favor of independence To better understand the usefulness of independence as a fairness measure let us compare it to other kinds of measures Take first sufficiency and separation The main difference between independence on the one hand and sufficiency and separation on the other is that independence is formulated without This means that while sufficiency and separation track the difference between a Note that above we have excluded the first case through the assumption that the confusion matrices are at least approximately representative of the true probabilities We have not excluded the second case prediction and the truth given by they are measures of error or deviation from the truth independence does not track deviation from the truth Prima facie this may seem like a deficiency of independence However as was just explained independence helps us detect unfairness in the distribution of exactly because it does not focus on deviations from It helps us to see what may be wrong with the distribution of itself This is an advantage of independence in contrast to separation and sufficiency Now let us compare independence to affirmative action viz the requirement that predictions have to satisfy certain thresholds or quota In the case of college admissions the requirement could be that a certain percentage of admitted candidates have to be members of a racial minority see for a discussion of affirmative action in the context of college admissions A justification for affirmative action is to compensate for historical injustice In this respect the justification of affirmative action is similar to the justification of independence given above However there are also important differences between independence and affirmative action One difference is that independence only requires predictions to be independent of group membership Affirmative action on the other hand can be more stringent in requiring that predictions satisfy certain proportions For example if only of college applicants belong to a minority independence would require that the admission rate for these is the same as the general admission rate while affirmative action may require that the admission rate among the is larger to allow for a given balance of admitted candidates irrespective of application rates This means that independence formulated for a given set of applicants will not correct for certain kinds of biases such as underrepresentation of groups among applicants while affirmative action may correct for this kind of bias More generally it should be stressed that while independence may highlight and help to compensate for certain kinds of historical injustice implementing it will not correct for many other forms of injustice In particular independence prescribes an intervention only on the prediction which can be interpreted as a compensation for a certain distribution of and does not prescribe an intervention on the causes of this distribution or an intervention on the effects of this distribution HOW TO REASON ABOUT FAIRNESS MEASURES We have now seen arguments both in favor and against independence and we have found that there is some validity to arguments on both sides How should we proceed from here How should these arguments be weighted We will not be able to answer these questions here but we can provide some rough guidelines in view of the above discussion First we should always explicitly state the moral value of either choosing or rejecting a group fairness measure such as independence as opposed to arguing solely on the basis of factual and descriptive properties of fairness measures We have seen why this is important in the case of independence We have argued that accuracy in and of itself does not have moral value We do not deny that accuracy can be morally beneficial in certain situations or contexts however it is these moral benefits we care about and they should be stated For example if neglecting accuracy has substantial social costs in some cases this is what we care about and not accuracy per se Only once the values supporting arguments for or against independence have been made explicit can we weight them Second gerrymandering is a problem shared by all measures of group fairness It is possible to violate individual fairness while complying with sufficiency or separation just as it is possible to comply with independence Now there is already a lot of work in computer science dealing with this problem beginning with who examine under which conditions independence and individual fairness can be combined One of the problems of combining measures of group fairness and individual fairness will be once more to make the moral value of either choice explicit and assign appropriate weights to these choices Third it is a mistake to think that we can either require or reject measures of group fairness independently of the case to which it is applied Rather the importance of different group fairness measures is context dependent We have seen examples of this above The cost of requiring independence in the case of classifying violent offenders is different from the cost of requiring independence in the case of college admissions In the first case the cost of making mistakes seems high in the second case the cost of making mistakes seems lower both for individuals and for society see Fourth the preceding two points suggest that none of the group fairness measures we discussed here are logically necessary or logically sufficient for fairness They cannot be logically sufficient because they violate individual fairness at least in some cases and they cannot be logically necessary because they appear to be in conflict with our intuitions about fairness in other cases This also suggests to interpret these measures of group fairness not as absolute criteria for fairness Rather they can be indicative of fairness or unfairness depending on the case at hand CONCLUSION In this paper we have examined the discussion of independence in the computer science literature and we have found that some arguments against independence are not convincing in that they either equally apply to other measures of group fairness or unduly emphasize descriptive properties of fairness measures viz conservativeness as opposed to normative ones We have also made a positive case for independence arguing that it can highlight a distinct kind of unfairness not captured by sufficiency or separation The main upshot of the present paper is that independence is an important measure of group fairness that has to be taken into account in discussions of algorithmic fairness A PROOFS Here we give proofs of the propositions in the main text All propositions and proofs can be found in the literature and are collected here for conveniences sake except for the proof of proposition which is new We first state some useful properties of conditional independence see the above references for proofs Proposition Properties of conditional independence If then if and then i and ii if then and if and is positively distributed everywhere then Note that properties also hold without conditioning on Proof of proposition A perfect predictor means that Sufficiency means and separation means For a perfect predictor these reduce to By property of conditional independence this is true for a perfect predictor because Proof of proposition The direction is property of conditional independence The direction can be seen as follows view as a two-dimensional random variable note that and are functions of this random variable projection then the result follows from property of conditional independence without conditioning on Proof of Proposition Incremental Conservativeness We show that sufficiency and separation are not in general preserved if the accuracy of a predictor is increased by giving an example where accuracy increases but separation and sufficiency are lost First consider the two following confusion matrices recall that stands for the true label while stands for the prediction Y total R total Table Group Ap Y total R total Table Group These matrices satisfy sufficiency and separation the easiest way to see this is to check that the table for is a multiple of the table for so the relative frequencies are the same which implies that sufficiency and separation are satisfied by proposition It can also be checked by hand by using the relation between the statistics of confusion matrices on the one hand and fairness on the other explained in section Now we increase the accuracy of the predictor by taking in each group an element of the false negatives and shifting it to the true positives This yields a new predictor with the following confusion matrices Y total R total Table Group Ap Y total R total Table Group Note that the predictor is more accurate in both groups Now we check whether these tables satisfy sufficiency and separation For sufficiency we would need that the positive predictive values PPV agree but we have For separation we would need that the false negative rates FNR agree but we have Thus we have increased accuracy and lost both separation and sufficiency This shows that separation and sufficiency are not incrementally conservative fairness measures Note that if we had increased accuracy in proportion to group size ie if we had shifted two elements instead of one from false negatives to true positives in group we would have preserved sufficiency and separation The reason for this is that this increment would have preserved the proportions of the confusion matrices between the two groups However this is a very special kind of increment The case we have discussed above with increments not proportional to the size of the groups is easier to realize and presumably more common Proof of proposition Sufficiency for groups means in the case and where the choice of yields an equivalent condition the same reasoning holds for Proof of proposition Similar to proof of proposition
