The Effect of the Rooney Rule on Implicit Bias in the Long Term The Rooney Rule originally proposed to counter implicit bias in hiring has been implemented in the private and public sector in various settings This rule requires that a decision-maker include at least one candidate from an underrepresented group in their shortlist of candidates Recently proposed a mathematical model of implicit bias and studied the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule when applied to a single selection decision However selection decisions often occur repeatedly over time eg a software firm is continuously hiring employees or a university makes admissions decisions every year Further it has been observed that given consistent counter-stereotypical feedback implicit biases against underrepresented candidates can change In this paper we propose a model of how a decision-makers implicit bias changes over time given their hiring decisions either with or without the Rooney Rule in place Our model draws from the work of and the literature on opinion dynamics Our main result is that for this model when the decision-maker is constrained by the Rooney Rule their implicit bias roughly reduces at a rate that is inverse of the size of the shortlist-independent of the total number of candidates whereas without the Rooney Rule the rate is inversely proportional to the number of candidates Thus our model predicts that when the number of candidates is much larger than the size of the shortlist the Rooney Rule enables a significantly faster reduction in implicit bias providing additional reason in favor of instating it as a strategy to mitigate implicit bias Towards empirically evaluating the long-term effect of the Rooney Rule in repeated selection decisions we conduct an iterative candidate selection experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk We observe that indeed decision-makers subject to the Rooney Rule select more minority candidates in addition to those required by the rule itself than they would if no rule is in effect and in fact are able to do so without considerably decreasing the utility of candidates selected INTRODUCTION Implicit bias is the unconscious association of certain qualities or lack thereof to individuals of socially salient groups like those defined by race gender or sexuality In recent decades a large body of experimental research has demonstrated the adverse effects of implicit bias in a wide range of contexts including hiring university admissions criminal justice and healthcare In fact even when decisions are based on quantifiable characteristics of the applicants decision-makers can systematically undervalue underrepresented candidates For instance it was found that women in managerial positions had to show roughly twice as much evidence to be seen as equally competent to men and evaluators across jobs unknowingly customized their evaluation criteria to favor the stereotypical gender The Rooney Rule is a simple and widely adopted policy to counteract the adverse effects of implicit bias It requires that at least one among a shortlist of candidates for further interviews or evaluation picked by a decision-maker must come from an underrepresented group It was originally instituted in the interview processes for hiring head coaches in the NFL in and since then has been adopted by various corporations such as Amazon Facebook and Microsoft and in several public sector contexts in the US In fact in the NFL strengthened the Rooney Rule to require at that least two minority candidates in the shortlist of interviewees for head coaching positions be from an underrepresented group This motivates a generalization of the rule to the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule also proposed in which requires at least of the shortlisted candidates to be in the underrepresented group Although there is evidence that the Rooney Rule has had a positive impact in various contexts it is a subject of much debate Proponents of the policy argue that it counteracts the effects of implicit bias while critics warn that it can lead to poorer selections Towards demonstrating the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule proposed a mathematical model of implicit bias and showed that the Rooney rule can improve the true utility of the decisionmaker in a single hiring decision More precisely they consider n candidates partitioned into two disjoint groups GY n where is the group of underrepresented candidates Each candidate has a true latent utility which is the value they would contribute if selected and an observed utility which is the decisionmakers potentially biased estimate of their latent utility They model the decision-makers implicit bias as a multiplicative factor such that the observed utility of underrepresented The code for the experiment in Section is available at To complete a version of the experiment similar to the one presented to participants see candidates those in is times their latent utility while the observed utility of all other candidates those in GY is the same as their latent utility Thus if the decision-maker evaluates underrepresented candidates without bias and its bias against them becomes more severe as approaches The decision-maker shortlists candidates out of n with the highest observed utility In the setting where n is much larger than characterize conditions on the proportion of underrepresented candidates B n and the distribution of latent utilities such that under these conditions applying the Rooney Rule for increases the total latent utility of the shortlisted candidates An important benefit of the Rooney Rule is that the decisionmaker has the opportunity to closely evaluate qualified underrepresented candidates see that their latent utility was greater than expected and learn to evaluate underrepresented candidates more accurately Indeed studies show that implicit biases can change over time and with changes in local-environments In particular it has been observed that exposure to other groups and counter-stereotypical evidence opposing the implicit beliefs can help reduce implicit bias Thus one would hope that as the decision-maker observes the latent utilities of more underrepresented candidates over multiple iterations of selection its implicit biases would change This is in line with work on belief and opinion formation which model how individuals update their beliefs and opinions based on the information they observe At a high-level these works model the beliefs of individuals using probability distributions where each time an individual receives new information the distribution is updated to incorporate the new information and reflect the corresponding new beliefs Our contributions We consider a mathematical model for implicit bias and how it updates each selection decision Under the assumptions of the model the Rooney Rule provably enables a significantly faster reduction in implicit bias of the decision-maker over multiple selection decisions when compared to the unconstrained condition this gives a mathematical explanation for the aforementioned empirical observations Our model maintains a probability distribution over the implicit bias of the decision-maker and updates this distribution after each iteration depending on the ratio of the latent utility of the shortlisted candidates and the observed utility of the shortlisted candidates see Section Technically we show that when the decision-maker uses the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule for its implicit bias reduces roughly at the rate of independent of n Theorem whereas when the decision-maker is not constrained by the Rooney Rule then the rate at which its implicit bias reduces is roughly n Theorem Thus when the number of applicants n is much larger than the size of the shortlist our model predicts that using the Rooney Rule leads to a significantly faster reduction in the decision-makers implicit bias Expanding on these results we characterize the effect of other parameters such as the proportion of underrepresented candidates on the change in the decisionmakers implicit bias over time Section We also discuss how To be precise consider and assume that the observed utility of an underrepresented candidate is times their latent utility Considering is more convenient in our setting our results generalize to other models where the decision-makers implicit bias is drawn from distributions not in the beta family and updated using other rules Section Thus our theoretical results complement the work of and provide an additional reason to instate the Rooney Rule as a strategy to mitigate implicit bias Towards empirically evaluating the effect of the Rooney Rule in repeated selections we enlist participants on Amazons Mechanical Turk to participate in an iterative selection experiment Section We represented candidates from two different groups with different colored tiles and applied bias to the observed utilities of one of the groups In each iteration participants were incentivized to maximize the latent utility of their selection and the latent utilities of their selections were revealed after each round We observe that the participants subject to the Rooney Rule selected significantly more underrepresented candidates in addition to those required by the rule itself than participants not subject to the rule without substantially decreasing the utility of candidates selected Related work Implicit bias Studying implicit bias is a rich field in psychology and several works study the origins of implicit bias its adverse effects and its long-term trends We point the reader to the excellent treatise for an overview of the field introduce a model for implicit bias and under this model characterized conditions where the Rooney Rule improves the latent utility of the selection Under the same model study the ranking problem a generalization of selection under implicit bias and propose simple constraints on rankings which improve the latent utility of the output ranking Both and consider the latent utility in a single instance of the problem whereas we are interested in how the implicit bias of the decision-maker changes over multiple iterations study selection under a different model of bias where the decision-makers observed utility has higher than average noise for underrepresented candidates They consider a family of constraints and show that in their model these constraints always increase the latent utility Unlike them our goal is to understand the effects of constraints on the implicit bias of the decision-maker In Section we discuss how our results generalize when there is noise in t Accounting for other forms of noise in the observed utilities can be an interesting extension to this work Belief update models Works on opinion dynamics and social learning study mathematical models of how peoples beliefs change when they gain new information Several works in this field represent beliefs by probability distributions and study simple rules similar to the one we consider to update these distributions We refer the reader to for a comprehensive overview of the field In a similar vein the theory of subjective logic mathematically models beliefs under uncertainty A seminal work gives a mapping from beliefs to a beta distribution Beta ab roughly a is the evidence favouring the belief and b evidence against it A canonical example is the statement A ball drawn at random from an urn of red and black balls will be red A person observes multiple draws from the urn and after each draw updates their belief Our model uses the beta distribution to model the decisionmakers implicit bias parameter and in relevant contexts can be viewed as the decision-makers belief in the following statement the latent utilities of candidates from group and group GY are identically distributed Long-term impact Several prior works have studied the long-term impacts of affirmative action policies on society consider how common fairness constraints in classification settings affect the underlying population over time assumes individuals have binary utilities qualified or unqualified and they give asymptotic results for a broad-set of dynamics depending on how the fraction of qualified individuals in each group changes studies a dynamics in the context of a labor market In contrast we allow for non-binary utilities study the effect on the decision-makers implicit bias and give non-asymptotic results Iterated learning experiments In a classic formulation of a function learning experiment in each iteration participants are given a numeric input and asked to predict its numeric output from some examples or using knowledge they accumulated so far Several experiments in cognitive science and behavioral economics use function learning experiments to study human performance on prediction tasks with incomplete information Related to our work these techniques have also been used to attempt to measure implicit biases We refer the reader to for an overview of the experimental work in this topic Our empirical experiment builds on the classic iterated learning experimental design there is a simple linear relationship between the observed input and latent utilities output However we do not ask for participants to explicitly predict the output instead they implicitly do so by selecting the observed utilities which they they predict will have the highest latent utilities output Notation For a natural number n N by n we denote the set n and for a real number x R by we denote ex We use calligraphic letters such and P to denote distributions and X D denotes a sample X drawn from D For a distribution D with probability density function its support is the set x x we denote the support of D by If the support of a distribution is an interval over the reals we say that the distribution is continuous We use t in the superscript to indicate the t-th iteration We use the subscript i to index the underrepresented candidates and to index all other candidates We use Beta ab to denote the beta distribution with parameters a and b It holds that Beta a a b Formally given ab define Beta ab to be the distribution with the following cumulative density function for all x Pr Beta ab x B x MODEL In each round of selection there are n candidates and a decisionmaker shortlists of them The candidates are partitioned into two disjoint groups GY n where denotes the group of underrepresented candidates The intersection GY is empty GY n We call the candidates the X -candidates and those in GY the Y -candidates Each candidate has a true or latent utility which is the value which a candidate would contribute if selected Denote this utility by Xi for the i-th X -candidate and by for the j-th Y -candidate We assume that the latent utilities of all candidates are independently and identically iid drawn in each iteration from some continuous distribution P We assume that P has non-negative and bounded support Let be the fraction of the underrepresented candidates B GY While the utilities of individual candidates change with time we assume that itself does not change and as a consequence under our assumption and GY also do not change Implicit bias model of In based on the empirical observations of the setting where the decision-maker does not observe latent utilities and instead sees an observed utility which is its possibly biased estimate of the latent utilities is considered They consider the following model of observed utilities parameterized by an implicit bias parameter define the observed utilities of an X -candidate i as Xi B Xi The observed utility of a Y -candidate is assumed to be the same as its latent utility Notice that in the above definition if then Xi Xi for all i and the decision-maker evaluates X -candidates without bias It is sometimes useful to define the following vectors X B Xi X B Xi and Y B where i varies over and varies over GY Candidate selection problems and the Rooney Rule The utility of a subset of candidates S is defined as the sum of the utilities of all candidates in S Given a subset S n define its total observed utility as util s X Y B i Xi Similarly define the total latent utility of S n as the sum of the latent utilities of all candidates in S util Y where we replace X in Equation by X As in we assume that the decision-maker selects a subset of candidates S of size which maximizes total observed utility S B argmax T n T util t X Y Note that when the set S may have few X -candidates disadvantaging those candidates The ℓ-th order Rooney Rule tries to address this by requiring the decision-maker to select at least X -candidates Note that if then the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule is the same as the usual Rooney Rule Let B T n T and T be the set of all subsets of size satisfying the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule The decision-maker constrained by the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule picks a subset satisfying the rule which maximizes the total observed utility B argmax T util t X Y Notice that the set S selected by the decision-maker without the the Rooney Rule in Equation is the same as the set S above As we discuss next the decision-maker updates its beliefs as a function of the total latent utility and the total observed utility of To simplify the notation there let and U be the total latent utility and the total observed utility of U B util X Y U B util X Y Note that before selecting the candidates the decision-maker knows U but does not know U Our implicit bias update model assumes that the decision-maker sees U after selecting the candidates The rationale is that after the decision-maker selects the candidates n and observes their actual performance at the job or in an interview it can better estimate their latent utility U Implicit bias update model Inspired by the works that give mappings from beliefs to beta distributions in each iteration we model the implicit bias as a draw from the a beta distribution Beta ab where ab and roughly a is the evidence favouring the belief and b evidence against it In our setting a is roughly proportional to the belief that X candidates have the same latent utility as Y -candidates and b is roughly proportional to bias against it Notice that the larger a is the closer is to no bias and the larger b is the closer is to largest bias If U U then the decision-maker has evidence that the X candidates performed better than expected In this case the decisionmakers implicit bias reduces ie a would increase Since we can argue that U U To see this note that U U i Xi and since and Xi for all i we have that U U Thus the decision-maker does not receive evidence to support its bias and so b is a constant in this model To summarize given parameter a which varies over iterations and some fixed parameter b we consider the distribution Da B Beta ab and draw the decision-makers implicit bias from Da This follows since the expected value of a Beta a b random variable is Since we consider multiple iterations of the above model of candidate selection we need to specify how evolves Let a superscript t on a variable indicate the variables value at the t-th iteration We start with a to be some fixed number greater than Suppose that in the t-th iteration the decision-maker selects a subset S t whose total latent utility is U t and total observed utility is U t We propose and study the following update rule at B U t U t at Update rule t Dat We summarize the complete mathematical model in Model Model Our implicit bias update model Initialize The Rooney Rule parameter Z a parameter a and a constant b For t do Sample Y t GY and X t i i iid from P Sample t from Dat B Beta at b Implicit bias Define X t i B t X t i for all i Observed utilities Select S t B argmax S util s X t Y t Shortlist Let U t B util s t X Y and U t B util s t X Y Update at B U t U t at Update implicit bias Discussion of the model While we consider a simple multiplicative update rule one could also study other update rules For instance some prior works on opinion dynamics study additive updates and updates where the new value is a convex combination of the current value and observation We discuss how our results generalize to other update rules in Section Note that our model assumes that the decision-maker evaluates the latent utility of all selected candidates together and so observes U t and U t and not the latent utilities of individual candidates we discuss other scenarios in Section The update rule in our model is only a function of the current belief and observation ie U t U t This is equivalent to the assumption made by the Bayesian-Without-Recall model Note however that the update in Equation is not Bayesian Our update rule also bears resemblance to the multiplicative weights update method that has been successfully used to explain learning in social groups and sexual evolution While our update rule does encode past observations considering more complicated rules which explicitly include all past observations can lead to interesting extensions of this work Our model incorporates uncertainty in the decision-makers implicit bias at each iteration by drawing from a distribution but assumes that the utilities do not have any noise It would be interesting to consider models which incorporate noise in the observations of the committee as well THEORETICAL RESULTS Our first result considers the case when the decision-maker uses the Rooney Rule It shows that under the implicit bias update rule when the decision-maker uses the Rooney Rule the reduction in its implicit bias is independent of n Theorem Fast learning with the Rooney Rule Under the implicit bias update rule given parameters ab there exists a constant C such that for all iterations t N population size n N number of candidates selected n parameter ratio of the underrepresented candidates and continuous and bounded distribution of latent utility P when the decision-maker is constrained by the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule then E t C C where the expectation is over the draws of implicit bias s and latent utilities of candidates in all previous iterations s t Note that the lower bound in Equation is independent of n and very roughly scales as At a high-level this is because the Rooney Rule ensures that the decision-maker selects at least fraction of the shortlist from and this fraction does not vary with n As we show in our next result this independence doesnt hold if the decision-maker does not use the Rooney Rule Theorem also shows that if the decision-maker uses the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule in the long term ie for a large t its expected implicit bias is almost no bias independent of the number of candidates n N To see this let t be a large value compared to then notice that both terms containing t in Equation are close to and do not depend on n Our next result considers the case when the decision-maker does not use the Rooney Rule It assumes that P is the uniform distribution on denoted by we discuss how the result extends to other distributions in Section Theorem Slow learning without the Rooney Rule Under the implicit bias update rule given parameters ab for all iterations t N number of candidates selected n and ratio of the underrepresented candidates when the decisionmaker is not constrained by the Rooney Rule ie and P is there exists a n N such that for all n n E t E C t n where the expectation is over draws of implicit bias s and latent utilities of candidates in all previous iterations s t Thus when the decision-maker is not constrained by the Rooney Rule the rate at which its implicit bias reduces approaches is no more than roughly To see this observe that rewriting Equation we get t t C Further from Theorem we can infer that for any fixed t N there is a large enough n such that decision-makers expected implicit bias after t iterations is almost the same as its initial implicit bias Thus together with Theorem Theorem shows a significant difference in the decision-makers implicit bias at a given iteration with and without the Rooney Rule when n is much larger than providing evidence to support implementing the Rooney Rule We note that Theorems and hold for any value of t and not just in the limit when t is large The upper bound in Theorem decreases becomes weaker as t increases This is necessary as we can show that for a fixed n as t the decision-maker becomes unbiased see Lemma B for a formal statement Finally we remark that in the statements of our theorems we have tried to capture the dependence on each parameter as cleanly as possible and not tried to optimize the constants Qualitative predictions We now summarize the qualitative effects of the parameters of our model on the decision-makers expected implicit bias Effect of n As discussed above when the decision-maker does not use the Rooney Rule the rate at which its implicit bias decreases slows down with n Theorem bias reduction rate n Intuitively this is because as the number of available Y -candidates increases a biased decision-maker selects fewer X -candidates Thus the decision-maker becomes less likely to observe that X -candidates perform better than expected In contrast when the decision-maker uses the Rooney Rule its expected implicit bias is independent of n Theorem bias reduction rate is independent of n Effect of When the decision-maker uses the Rooney Rule increasing increases its learning Theorem bias reduction rate This is intuitive as increasing leads the decision-maker to select a larger number of X -candidates and hence is more likely to observe that they perform better than they expected Mathematically this is because the update U t U t is an increasing function of the total utility of the X -candidates selected And the total utility of the X -candidates increases on selecting more candidates One might think that this means setting is the optimal choice However in the real world reducing the decision-makers bias is not the only objective and the choice of should also consider other factors Effect of Increasing holding everything else fixed decreases the decision-makers expected implicit bias at any given iteration Theorem bias reduction rate Effect of Both the lower bound and upper bound are increasing functions of We can infer that in both cases increasing fixing other parameters increases t bias reduction rate Intuitively increasing increases the fraction of X -candidates and makes it more likely for the decision-maker to select -candidate as the number of positive outliers whose observed utility appears to be good despite the bias increases Generalizations of our theoretical results Generalizing to other distributions of implicit bias In this section we show how our results generalize when Da is not a beta distribution This can be interesting for instance if the decision-makers implicit biases do not follow the beta family or when the draws of t are noisy Notation Let Da be any continuous distribution supported on and parameterized by a Define as the expected value of drawn from B and median a as the median of Da For example we can consider Da to be the truncated normal distribution with mean a and fixed variance in which case median a a Assume that is an increasing function is concave is decreasing in a and finite for every a and there is a constant C such that for all a n median a median a C a We prove the following versions of Theorem and Theorem Informal For all a there is a constant C such that for all t N n N n and continuous and bounded P when the decision-maker applies the Rooney Rule the following holds t a C C e Informal For all a there is a constant C such that for all t N N when the decision-maker applies the Rooney Rule and P B there is a constant n N such that for all n n the following holds t a C t n t n We present their formal statements and proofs in Supplementary Material B Discussion of assumptions In Model a roughly represents how unbiased the decision-maker is Thus it is natural to expect Assumption and first part of Assumption We can avoid Assumption we explain this with the proof although then the upper bound becomes slightly weaker The second part of Assumption intuitively says that the decision-makers implicit bias does not have a large probability mass near extreme bias Finally Assumption upper bounds the median a in terms of a it says that the median is not too close to no bias for a given a Discussion Allowing for different distributions of implicit bias potentially due to noise is related to who consider noise in the decision-makers implicit bias in one iteration However they draw a different value of implicit bias for each candidate and consider different levels of noise for both groups of candidates Expanding Model to incorporate these would be an interesting direction for future work Remark Note that if we substitute the definition of for the beta distribution in Equation we recover Theorem and if substitute the definition in Equation we recover Theorem Generalizing to other update rules In this section we consider the update rule at B at U t U t where is a continuous function satisfying some mild assumptions In particular we assume that is strictly increasing and is concave We prove the following versions of Theorem and Theorem Informal Under update rule if satisfies the above assumptions and the decision-maker uses the Rooney Rule then for all there exists an iteration t N such that t Informal Under update rule if satisfies the above assumptions and the decision-maker does not use the Rooney Rule then for all and t N there exists an n N such that for all n n t We present their formal statements and proofs Supplementary Material B Generalizing Theorem to other distributions We can extend Theorem to other continuous and bounded distributions of latent utility P In this case we need to make a mild assumption on P which is satisfied by several distributions Notation Let M be the supremum of the support of P M B Define TP as the probability that drawn from P is at least Formally TP B P X Assume that there exists a function N R satisfying en TP n poly n Assumption Then we get the following upper bound in Theorem E t E t poly n Here poly hides the dependence on We do not state the dependence on as it changes with the choice of P We present the formal statement as Theorem A Discussion of assumption This assumption holds for several common distributions including all continuous distribution with a compact interval support see Supplementary Material A This also includes common truncated distributions like the truncated power law and truncated normal distributions For instance when P we have TP and we can choose n OVERVIEW OF PROOF TECHNIQUES In this section we overview of proofs of Theorems and The complete proofs have been delegated to the Supplementary Material due to space restrictions We first need some additional notation Let denote the expectation of Beta ab B a a b Note that is an increasing and concave function Let X max B maxi X t i and Y max B max Y t Let U t X and U t Y be the utility of all X -candidates selected and all Y -candidates selected in iteration t respectively U t X B i t X t i and U t Y B t Y t It will be convenient to consider t B U t U t Expressing the update rule with t we get at at t We can equivalently write t as t t U t X t U t X U t Y Observe that t is a decreasing function of U t Y and t and an increasing function of U t X Further as discussed in the Section U t U t and so t and at at Proof sketch of Theorem Fix an iteration t N In the proof we show a lower bound on at which holds with high probability Then using the fact that is increasing we can condition on the event that at is large to derive the desired lower bound on t Eat t Towards this consider the following events Et B X t max Y t max and t B t median t Conditioning on them we can show a one-step lower bound on at Lemma Conditional lower

given s B s median s it holds t t b a b Now conditioning on Es and s and using the above we get s t t U s Y s X t t b at b The lemma follows by using the update rule and simplifying Next we extend Lemma along with other facts to show a lower bound on at alluded to earlier Towards this note that Pr t We show that by analyzing an equivalent urn model Let Z t be the indicator random variable that Et t occurs Since Et and t are independent t B t t Note that the event t only depends on the draw of t and that E t only depends on X t and Y t Thus it follows that Z t only depends on random variables from the t-th iteration and that for all t t Z t and Z t are independent random variables This allows us to use the Chernoff bound on the sum t s Z s Pr t s Z s Pr t s Z s E t s Z s Using Lemma and Z s B Es for each s t we get at a t s Z s ab a b Substituting this in Equation we get Pr at a ab a b Let C be the constant C B ab ab and a B a C Recall that a and b are fixed constants strictly larger than Now we can prove the result as follows E t Eat a a d a a d a a d a is increasing a a b a C a b C C a b C Choosing CB C ab and simplifying completes the proof Remark The only properties of the beta distribution used in the proof are that is an increasing function and that the median of t is upper bounded by a suitable value Abstracting these properties will give an analogous proof of Equation Remark It might be possible to tighten the dependence of Equation on using techniques from In particular the factor may improve to roughly Specifically the inverse CDF of the draw of t Proof sketch of Theorem Fix an iteration t N In the proof we show an upper bound on Eat Then using that is concave and increasing we can prove the desired upper bound on t Eat t Let Dt denote the set of all random variables from the first t iterations Dt B s st X s st Y s st Then we prove the following lemmas Lemma Upper bound on t when t is close to For all iterations s N constant

is not close to For all iterations s N constant values of and parameters ab it holds s E s s U t X b a Due to space constraints we defer the proof of Lemma till Supplementary Material A It roughly follows by upper bounding s by s rearranging and using the value of the inverse moment of the beta distribution Lemma Upper bound on Pr U t X when t is not close to For all iterations t N and values of if then there exists an n N such that for all nn and n it holds Pr U t X t Proof outline In the proof we show that the decision-maker selects an X -candidate with probability at most Notice that this implies the lemma since if no X -candidates are selected then U s X Towards this we use the Chernoff bound to show that conditioned on s with high probability at least Y -candidates have higher observed utilities than X max Note that Lemma uses We would like to upper bound E s for all values of To this end consider three cases Case s is close to s Case s is far from s t X and Case s is far from s t X Using Lemma in Case we have s In Case from Lemma and Lemma we can bound E s by b a Finally in Case it holds that s see Equation Note that each of these results holds for all values of Combining these and setting B we can show that E s n a b a Using same E s E E s upper bound also holds for E s Consider t t Using Equation we have E t t x E t t x t n a b a x t n a b a Similarly for t

substituting Equation in the above rearranging and choosing C B a a we can complete the proof Remark The only properties of the beta distribution used in the proof are that is concave and increasing and an upper bound on the inverse moment of the beta distribution Abstracting these properties gives an analogous proof for Equation EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS We enlisted participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk for an iterative candidate selection experiment in order to observe the effect of the Rooney Rule on their long-term behavior Participants were shown colored tiles representing candidates along with the tiles observed utilities and were instructed to select a small fixed number of tiles with the goal of maximizing the latent utility of the selection this was incentivized by tying their bonus payment to the latent utility attained They were informed that the observed utilities were noisy estimates of the latent utilities We required some participants to follow the Rooney Rule and did not constrain others In this section we give an overview of the experimental design and our analysis of the results Experimental design A total of participants located in the US were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete a repeated selection experiment In each of T iterations participants were presented with n tiles representing candidates in order of highest to lowest observed utility Half of the tiles were red representing Y -candidates and half were blue representing X -candidates ie The latent utilities X t i Y t for each tile was drawn from the uniform distribution on the interval The observed utilities for the red tiles Y t were sampled from NY t The observed utilities for the blue tiles X t i were sampled from X t i where is the bias coefficient All observed and latent utilities were then rounded to the nearest integer Participants were paid at a rate of about /hour The experiment received institutional review board IRB exemption Category and from Yale University The participants were instructed to select tiles to try to maximize the total latent utility u t in each iteration t T given the observed utility of each tile They were told that the observed utilities were noisy estimates of the latent utilities In each round after they submitted their choices participants were shown the latent utility of each tile they selected hence they could learn about the latent utilities of each group over time About half of the participants out of chosen at random were constrained to follow the Rooney Rule with ie they were required to select at least one blue tile The other half of the participants out of were unconstrained ie We refer to the constrained group of participants as RRGrp and the unconstrained group of participants as ControlGrp Our goal was to compare the performance across the two groups RRGrp and ControlGrp in the long term ie after having been granted some opportunity to learn about the latent utilities of both groups Hence our analysis focuses on the choices made in the last fifteen iterations The Rooney Rule results in less inequality in the long term Recall that participants selected tiles in each iteration and that according to the distribution of latent utilities participants should select five blue and five red tiles on average the observed utilities exhibited bias against the blue tiles rendering them lower in the ranking and hence less likely to be selected In the last fifteen observations we observe that the RRGrp selects blue tiles on average while ControlGrp selects on average As participants subject to the Rooney Rule are required to select at least one blue tile one might wonder if this difference between the RRGrp and ControlGrp is solely due to the Rooney Rule requirement Surprisingly this is not the case suggesting that additional learning has occurred In particular we consider the number of blue tiles selected in addition to the ones required by the Rooney Rule ie we subtract from the number of blue tiles selected for RRGrp participants and from ControlGrp We find a statistically significant p difference between the number of blue tiles selected in addition to the requirement between RRGrp and ControlGrp see Figure This suggests that participants learn to select more equal numbers of blue and red tiles as a result of implementing the Rooney Rule This aligns with our theoretical result that participants subject to the Rooney Rule reduce their biases at a faster rate than an unconstrained decision-maker The Rooney Rule does not negatively affect the utility in the long term We observe that the total utility u t modestly increases over iterations t T for both RRGrp and ControlGrp This suggests that participants in both RRGrp and ControlGrp are learning to select more optimally over time However we are particularly interested in understanding how well a decision-maker subject to the Rooney Rule can fulfill its is the normal distribution with mean and standard deviation We choose because previous empirical work has found evidence for bias at least as extreme as For images of the user interface the instructions the demonstration and feedback we refer the reader to Supplementary Material C This number is arbitrary to some extent but we found similar results for other choices Figure The number of blue tiles selected in addition to the required number is greater for RRGrp than ControlGrp with significance p using Welchs t-test Mean Standard deviation RRGrp ControlGrp Welchs t-test Null hypothesis population means same Alternative hypothesis population means different t-statistic Degrees of freedom p-value latent utility-maximizing objective in the long term To this end we compare the mean latent utility attained by RRGrp and ControlGrp during the last fifteen iterations We measure the latent utility achieved by RRGrp and ControlGrp as a proportion of an optimal latent utility that could be achieved if one knew the distributions of latent and observed utilities a priori In a given iteration t T define the optimal strategy set as the tiles with the top values from X t i Y t GY We call the latent utility of the optimal strategy set the optimal strategy utility From this point on we report the latent utility for a given selection as a fraction of the optimal strategy utility We also define the latent utility derived from blue red tiles for a given selection to mean the latent utility of selected blue red tiles as a fraction of the optimal strategy utility Figure The latent utility of RRGrp is less than that of ControlGrp but the latent utility derived from the blue tiles was higher for RRGrp than ControlGrp Latent utility mean standard deviation overall derived from blue derived from red RRGrp ControlGrp We find that in the long term the latent utility obtained by RRGrp is less than that of the ControlGrp by only Moreover the latent utility derived from the blue tiles was higher for the RRGrp than ControlGrp see Figure Hence even though the latent utility attained by RRGrp and ControlGrp were not substantially different a much greater proportion of RRGrp latent utility came from blue tiles The difference between the means of latent utility derived from blue tiles for the two groups is statistically significant at p See Supplementary Material C for details This suggests that implementing the Rooney Rule can increase the contributions from underrepresented candidates to the overall latent utility without substantially decreasing the total latent utility attained As another metric for how well a decision-maker subject to the Rooney Rule can fulfill its utility-maximizing objective we also analyzed optimal strategy overlap the number of selected tiles in the optimal strategy set We find similar results the total optimal strategy overlap is not very different for RRGrp versus ControlGrp but the optimal strategy overlap derived from to blue tiles is much higher for RRGrp see Supplementary Material C for details Welchs t-test assumes independence between samples We also analyzed mixed effects model to account for the multiple samples from each participant and found similar results see Supplementary Material C Because of the noise added to each observed utility the optimal strategy may not be the same as the set of tiles with the greatest latent utilities Summary of empirical results We observe two dominant trends in participant behavior in the empirical iterative selection experiment Participants subject to the Rooney Rule select more blue tiles in addition to the required number in the long term than the unconstrained participants We interpret this to mean that they learn to select more equal numbers of blue and red tiles faster than the unconstrained participants This aligns with our main theoretical result that participants subject to the Rooney Rule reduce their biases at a faster rate than others There was no substantial difference in the mean latent utility of RRGrp versus ControlGrp However while the mean total latent utility between RRGrp and ControlGrp was not very different a much larger proportion of the latent utility came from blue tiles for participants subject to the Rooney Rule We interpret this to mean that participants subject to the Rooney Rule learn to increase the latent utility derived from blue tiles while nearly matching the total latent utility of selections made by unconstrained participants These trends suggest that over the long term implementing the Rooney Rule can yield significant benefits for increasing representation of underrepresented candidates without substantially decreasing total latent utility LIMITATIONS Model and theoretical results We consider a model with two groups where the decision-maker is implicitly biased against one underrepresented group However in real-world applications there may be multiple and intersecting groups say those defined by race and gender and where the candidates at the intersection of two or more underrepresented groups may face a larger implicit bias Further we consider that the decision-maker evaluates the candidates selected say for an interview in aggregate it compares U t and U t and sees the latent utilities of all selected candidates without noise But the decision-maker may assign more or less weight to the latent utility of the X -candidates and learn only a noisy version of the latent utility of the selected candidates We make some progress toward this by allowing for noise in the decision-makers implicit bias see Section Empirical results The iterative selection experiment in our empirical results is different from real-world candidate selection tasks in several ways For one the bias is imposed exogenously on the observed utilities that the selection decision-maker sees rather than coming from their own implicit cognitive processes If selection decision-makers evaluate the merit of candidates based on their own experience or criteria they might trust these assessments more than the observed utilities presented to them in the experiment Similarly the stakes of the experiment for participants were lower than in real-world tasks decision-makers in the real world may pay more attention to slight variations in the performance of the candidates selected In future work it would be interesting to study how participant biases change over time if they assess candidates based on subjective criteria like a recommendation letter that is biased against one group rather than being provided biased observed utilities at the beginning of each iteration It would also be valuable to incorporate the real-world social biases of participants into an iterative candidate selection task this could shed insight on how actual social biases shape peoples decisions Specificity Our theoretical analysis and empirical observations are only applicable when the decision-maker is not explicitly biased and the selection process is not tokenistic An explicitly biased decision-maker would remain biased no matter which candidates are presented and a tokenistic process may not require the decisionmaker to consider underrepresented candidates seriously Further other societal and structural biases and discrimination can also influence the decision-maker as when standardized test scores disadvantage minority and low-income candidates The Rooney Rule is only one of the many policies to mitigate bias and discrimination more broadly and it is important to consider implementing it as a part of a larger toolkit for positive social change CONCLUSION We consider a theoretical model of how a decision-makers implicit bias changes over repeated candidate selection processes and study the effect of the Rooney Rule on the decision-makers implicit bias We show that under our model if the decision-maker uses the Rooney rule then the rate at which its implicit bias reduces decreases with the size of the shortlist but is independent of the number of candidates However when the decision-maker does not use the Rooney Rule the same rate decreases with the number of candidates Section Thus in the regime where the total number of candidates is much larger than the size of the shortlist our results predict a significantly faster reduction in the decision-makers implicit bias by using the Rooney Rule giving another reason to use it to mitigate implicit bias in the long term Toward understanding the robustness of this result we consider some extensions of the model and show how our results generalize to them Section Here in particular we consider noise in the implicit bias of the decision-maker which can change the distribution of the implicit bias and identify properties of the resulting distribution where our results hold see Section An interesting direction for future work could be to examine the effects of noise in the observed utilities as in our empirical study Section Our empirical findings based on the experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk show that over multiple rounds the Rooney Rule helped the participants learn to select a shortlist which is more representative of the qualified candidates in the applicant pool without substantially decreasing the latent utility of selected candidates Our findings provide evidence that the Rooney Rule can reduce the biases of the decision-maker in repeated candidate selection processes The policy can be a simple and effective tool as part of a larger effort to mitigate implicit bias
