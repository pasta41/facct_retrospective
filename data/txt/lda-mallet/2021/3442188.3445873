The Distributive effects of Risk Prediction in Environmental Compliance Algorithmic Design Environmental Justice and Public Policy Government agencies are embracing machine learning to support a variety of resource allocation decisions The US Environmental Protection Agency EPA for example has engaged academic research labs to test the use of machine learning in support of an important national initiative to reduce Clean Water Act violations We evaluate prototypical risk prediction models that can support compliance interventions and demonstrate how critical algorithmic design choices can generate or mitigate disparate impact in environmental enforcement First we show that the definition of which facilities to focus on through this national compliance initiative hinges on arbitrary differences in state-level permitting schemes causing a shift in environmental protection away from areas with more minority populations Second the policy objective to reduce the noncompliance rate is encoded in a classification model which does not account for the extent of pollution beyond the permitted limit We hence compare allocation schemes between regression and classification and show that the latter directs attention towards facilities in more rural and white areas Overall our study illustrates that as machine learning enters government algorithmic design can both embed and elucidate sources of administrative policy discretion with discernable distributional consequences CONCEPTS Social and professional topics Governmental regulations Applied computing

INTRODUCTION Governments are rapidly experimenting with machine learning for public policy raising significant questions about accountability fairness and governance One emerging application area is in environmental sustainability Serious noncompliance exists across environmental programs and machine learning offers the promise to help predict sources of noncompliance and thereby target environmental compliance efforts This paper considers the case of a National Compliance Initiative NCI for the Environmental Protection Agency EPA This NCI aims to reduce significant noncompliance SNC under the Clean Water Act the nations premier piece of legislation to protect the waterways of the United States EPAs goal is to reduce the SNC rate by from to relative to a baseline from The NCI was pioneering in scope relative to previous enforcement efforts that tended to be sector or facility-type specific Most importantly as we document below EPA extended the scope of enforcement priorities by including both major and minor facilities and engaged in a comprehensive assessment of programmatic efforts to secure compliance In support of this NCI and broader environmental compliance goals the EPA has laudably engaged the academic community to discern how machine learning methods can contribute These engagements oer a fruitful opportunity to study distributive implications in this important public policy domain We show that two key elements of policy and algorithmic design may have considerable distributive effects influencing who bears the burden of excess pollution and how intensely First the NCI was designed to measure compliance across a subset of permitted facilities under the Clean Water Act Notwithstanding the major expansion of coverage under the NCI to include minor facilities the same type of facility eg a wastewater treatment plant may be included or excluded from the purview of the NCI due to variations in how states implement their pollution permitting process We show that this decision in effect converts an ambitious and well-intentioned national compliance initiative into a more of a patchwork compliance initiative that functionally concentrates on only a handful of states and communities In effect environmental federalism impedes the national goal Second the NCI targets the rate of noncompliance regardless of how much individual facilities discharge above their permitted limits In machine learning terms this policy choice leads to classification of facilities into whether they are likely to be in SNC status not regression of predicted discharges above the limit We show that this objective shifts resources away from the most severe violators in higher minority areas towards smaller facilities in areas with fewer minorities as a share of the overall population We also compare these effects against an oracle test and show that ML models may increase or decrease disparate impact relative to the case with full knowledge of realized outcomes Our study illustrates that fair algorithmic design will increasingly be intertwined with policy discretion While government use of predictive algorithms can unwittingly reinforce prior discretionary policy choices formalization in algorithmic design can also provide a chance to study the potential for disparate impact associated with such policy choices The rest of the paper proceeds as follows Section discusses the related literature and Section provides background on the policy setting Section details our methods particularly the development of the risk model and tests for demographic bias Section provides results and Section concludes RELATED LITERATURE Our work contributes to several distinct literatures First as the public sector has rapidly adopted machine learning systems core questions have focused on the accountability of algorithmic decision tools in the face of public law constraints While much attention has focused on the use of risk assessment scores and facial recognition technology in criminal justice far fewer in-depth investigations and case studies exist of the adoption of such decision tools in civil justice for important exceptions see Chouldechova et al for instance examines fairness of an algorithmic decision making tool for child welfare determinations Few works in the the FATML community concern the use of algorithms in environmental sustainability however and our study provides an in-depth case study of algorithmic design policy and accountability in this policy domain Our results also contribute to questions about the perceived trade-off between accuracy and explainability in machine learning Despite the fact that our data draws on rich information from hundreds of millions of EPA records we show that relatively simple models provide much of the predictive performance in this particular domain Second our study relates to a growing literature albeit one that is largely disconnected from machine learning about the distributional consequences of environmental resource allocation Wikstrom et al employ the CalEnviroScreen EJ monitoring tool a tool that combines data on environmental burdens with sociodemographic data to assess how water resource allocation policies in the form of cutbacks during drought differentially affect minority communities highly ranked in the EJ assessment Maguire and Sheri characterize the evolution of the term of Environmental Justice Figure Census Block Groups with NPDES permitted facilities tend to fall in the lower tail of the income distribution in a given county as illustrated by mapping the location of NPDES permittees inmap orange dots in histogram salmon-colored bins within the distribution of median incomes in the example case of San Mateo County California as well as techniques to study and surface the possibility disproportionate environmental harms that may arise from the regulatory rulemaking The economists Banzhaf et al review the spatial nature of environmental justice concerns and characterize the multiple mechanisms that can give rise to disproportionate harm and exposure landing on some communities over others Much of this literature has attempted to understand the causal factors of environmental injustice often using retrospective observational studies Yet as the concept of environmental justice becomes institutionalized it is also critical to understand what can be done about these disparities prospectively EPA established the Oce of Environmental Equity in to address concerns that racial minority and low-income populations bear a higher environmental risk burden than the general population In the same year all federal agencies were tasked to examine the disproportionate harms their programs may have low-income and minority communities through an executive order on environmental justice Our case study shows how algorithmic decisions that are actively being developed may exacerbate or mitigate disparate impact depending on key design decisions Third related to the broader environmental justice literature an extensive body of work has specifically investigated disparities in the of polluting activities Figure for instance speaks to some of these concerns by plotting the Clean Water Act permitted facilities in San Mateo County California illustrating that such facilities are disproportionately sited in lower income areas Banzhaf et al review the complex causal dynamics driving these disparities We contribute to this literature by examining whether conditional on decisions the implementation of the NCI may have a further distributive effect on which communities are protected from pollution Last our study contributes to the literature on regulatory enforcement Hindin and Silberman focuses on mechanisms to improve rule design to promote compliance Konisky examines whether the number of enforcement actions taken by state EPAs is correlated with demographics at the county-level And many studies have speculated that algorithmic decision tools may improve the accuracy and consistency of regulatory enforcement Hino et al for instance illustrate how prototypical machine learning models applied on publicly available data about permitted facilities under the Clean Water Act could help more effectively target facilities at risk of violation Engstrom and Ho consider whether algorithmic decision tools may improve the quality of enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission and determinations by the Social Security Administration where a central concern of administrative law has been about the consistency of decision making This paper seeks to bridge these distinct literatures spanning economics legal studies environmental studies geography public administration and machine learning to better understand how algorithmic design affects how and where resources to manage environmental quality are allocated POLICY BACKGROUND The Clean Water Act CWA is the principal legislation governing surface water pollution in the United States Its primary objective is to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the Nations waters The CWA endows the EPA with the authority to implement pollution control programs as well as set standards for wastewater and surface water quality One of the key ways EPA implements these tasks is through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES permit program For any discharge from a point source eg a pipe into US surface waters facilities must apply for a NPDES permit That permit species the conditions under which facilities can discharge setting limits on water quality parameters eg the quantity or concentration of nitrogen phosphorous or metals acidity pH and temperature Discharges in violation of the CWA are subject to civil and criminal penalties with the goal of incentivizing facilities to adopt advanced water treatment and pollution reduction technologies The primary monitoring mechanism for the CWA comes through reporting obligations on facilities Permitted facilities are required to self-report information on the water quality of their discharges typically monthly to environmental authorities These discharge monitoring reports DMRs provide information on the results of water quality tests on features such as temperature pH values and the quantity and concentration of for example solids that can transport pollutants or inhibit marine life As with much US environmental law the CWA is an arrangement of cooperative federalism For states and one territory EPA has delegated the authority to state environmental agencies to administer the NPDES programs Despite the ambition of the CWA noncompliance under the CWA remains pervasive Based on self-reported DMRs between of facilities are in noncompliance each year contributing to water quality impairment that can render streams and rivers unswimmable or Because of these patterns EPAs five-year strategic plan highlighted the CWA as an area of enforcement focus and established the goal of cutting significant noncompliance in half over a three year term In support of its broader enforcement goals EPA has already engaged multiple academic labs to develop machine learning methods that leverage the large-scale administrative data within the EPA estimated by one analyst to be the largest federal government database outside those of the Internal Revenue Service and facilitate early interventions enforcement actions Rather than reacting to facilities that are already noncompliant the EPA aims to use predictive risk assessment techniques to target and then prevent facilities from becoming noncompliant in the rst place We now articulate two major policy and algorithmic design decisions in the deployment of machine learning for this initiative Targeted Population For the purposes of the NCI the CWA compliance rate is calculated based on the subset of CWA-regulated facilities that submit DMRs to federal EPA Beginning in states were required to push electronic versions of the DMRs to the federal EPA This rule also expanded reporting obligations from primarily major to include minor facilities two classes of facilities distinguished principally based on daily ow Previously only major permits typically reported DMRs and the reporting was not necessarily conducted electronically but the inclusion of minor permits was a substantial and important expansion of the scope of enforcement priorities by nearly seven-fold as indicated in Table At the same time the rst phase of this electronic reporting rule was made applicable only to individual permits which cover a specific discharging entity eg a single wastewater treatment plant States are currently not required to push DMRs for so-called general permits which are permits to cover multiple dischargers engaged in similar activities and with similar types of effluent and will not be required to until the next phase of the electronic reporting rules implementation scheduled for However whether a wastewater treatment facility is licensed under an individual or general permit is largely contingent on state-level choices the same type of facility may be permitted as either general or individual depending on the historical permitting decision systems made by states Moreover many general permittees do in fact submit DMRs to EPA making it possible to study what impact the decision to delay the inclusion of general permittees implies for the distribution of environmental protection Noncompliance Rate as Objective The second major dimension of policy design rests on the ultimate policy objective ie the focus on the reducing the rate of significant noncompliance SNC The SNC designation refers to the most serious class of CWA violations considered to pose a threat to US waterways As outlined in a EPA legal memorandum several criteria may result in a facility falling into SNC including failure to report discharges within days of expected dates or persistent considerable excess of permitted limits As Table indicates approximately facilities were classified as in SNC in year henceforth FY Of the ve key types of SNC outlined in this paper focuses on effluent violations which constitute of the facilities in SNC status and that furthermore pose a directly measurable threat to water quality In broad brushstrokes a facility is considered as having an effluent-related SNC if one of their permitted discharges exceeds its permitted limit by any amount four times within two consecutive quarters or exceeds a predetermined threshold twice within two quarters The Code of Federal Regulations and the memo note that the predetermined SNC threshold beyond the permitted limit for conventional pollutants eg Nitrogen Phosphorous total suspended solids detergents oils and total organic carbon is and for toxic pollutants eg most metals cyanide and toxic organic compounds is For simplicity of exposition we will use SNC to refer to effluent SNC for the remainder of the paper unless explicitly indicated otherwise Status General Total SNC DMR Nonreceipt SNC effluent SNC Other SNC Non-SNC Total SNC Rate Table Types and Quantities of significant Noncompliance among General and Individual Permittees for FY We examine the implications of using a rate as the policy objective in greater detail below because the current definition of significant noncompliance does not distinguish between the extent of effluent violations once the initial thresholds are met For example Figure plots the cumulative distribution of how much permittees reporting nitrogen effluent exceed their limits in percent-above-limit terms sorted by their exceedance percent Each of the permits would contribute equally to the current NCI goal of reducing the SNC rate upon returning to compliance However some permits exceed their permits by a much larger margin than others the lowest half of the individual general facilities agged as with an effluent SNC account for of the aggregate percent over limit for the permits recording nitrogen discharges and agged as in effluent SNC in FY As seen on the left side of the graph a single individual permit contributes to of the total across all permits In other words a classification lens considers all these permits equal although one could reasonably think that permittees who far exceed their limits would generate a much higher negative impact than those marginally overstepping their limits METHODS Data This work draws upon three main sources of data First we extract information about historical discharge volumes compliance history and permit-level variables eg individual versus general from EPAs Integrated Compliance Information System ICIS on NPDES permits A key data source within ICIS rests in the over million records from Discharge Monitoring Reports DMRs which are periodic self-reports submitted by facilities to state level environmental agencies and subsequently to the US EPA with Cumulative Permits with Effluent SNC Cumulative Total Discharge Over Limit Nitrogen Permit Type General Individual Figure Some permits account for a much higher share of overall effluent exceedances than others For example where the dashed lines indicate half of all evaluated permits per permit type and permits are sorted by their percent exceedance high to low the at-right half of individual general permits closest to the effluent SNC limit account for only of the aggregate percent over limit for the permits recording nitrogen discharges and agged as in effluent SNC in FY information about their compliance with permitted effluent limits We draw upon data from years to predict risk of the binary SNC status and the percent exceedance in the rst quarter of year October to December henceforth FY-Q ultimately developing a training set that reflects features aggregated to be as of FY-Q or FY-Q for test We subset the data to include only permits with reported discharges relevant to the effluent SNC calculation discussed more in subsection and EPA-assigned SNC statuses in the target quarter FY-Q thus resulting in a final sample of individual and general permits Second socio-demographic information on race and median household incomes at the census block group level are extracted from the version of the ve year American Community Survey provided by the US Census Bureau Third as a proxy for the degree of environmental burdens communities face we draw upon figures of population density within three miles of a permittee and the EJScreen percentile ag from the EPAs Environmental Compliance and History Online ECHO tool The EJ screen ag in particular reflects a combination of demographic as well as environmental data and consistent with the EPAs ag the indicator we use flags areas at the th percentile or above across the US that are suspected to have higher pre-existing potential pollution exposure Analyses were primarily conducted in R version and summary statistics on all variables used in our analyses are featured alongside the data dictionary in Appendix A Unfortunately permittees had incorrect geocoordinates which prevented us from associating them with demographic information Therefore the results that feature demographic information reflects a smaller total of permittees Risk Prediction Models and Objectives To examine the distributive implications of noncompliance prediction models we investigate two different ways of using predictions to generate the priority list of noncompliant facilities to target in FY-Q simulating how the EPA would employ such risk models using data from the previous quarter FY-Q The rst method focuses on predicting permit level discharge volumes regression and the second focuses on predicting the risk of falling into effluent SNC status classification Both models employ a Random Forest model with the same input features the models only vary in the outcome variable generated We detail the construction of each outcome variable after a brief discussion of the common elements between the two designs Random Forest Our Random Forest models ingest features drawn from historical discharge volumes time series predictions of discharge volumes historical compliance status information over the past two years and time-invariant permit-level characteristics such as location information industrial sector and permit type Appendix Figure elaborates each input feature and its definition Regression Calculating Permit-Level Overages Across Pollutants and Monitoring Locations In order to both establish as well as predict the intensity of violations with a continuous measure we require some aggregation across pollutants Indeed even the same permitted pollutant might have a varying allowable limit over time Building on the nomenclature that EPA uses for monitoring and reporting discharges that result in violations we rst construct an aggregate measure of pollution overages that relies on understanding the volume discharged relative to the permitted limit Namely we define our regression objective in terms of the exceedance percentage that is the ratio of the exceedance amount relative to the corresponding limit values Each pollution parameter that contributes to the SNC status calculation falls into one of two categories Category is comprised of so-called conventional pollutants such as Nitrogen and Phosphorous and Category is comprised of toxic materials and metals Practically these two categories set two different thresholds for the percentage over the permitted limit that will trigger an SNC violation for Category and for Category Since the threshold differs across these groups yet we still seek to develop an aggregate measure across all SNC-eligible pollution parameters monitored in a given permit we construct a measure based on the pollution parameter-specic percentage thresholds that can trigger the effluent SNC status Where we define as total permit overage as the percent overage for each category discharge and the percent overage for each category discharge we generate a composite permit exceedance value that can be represented as the weighted sum of all recorded exceedance percentages of each parameter for a given permit The final weighted sum of all exceedance percentages for each permit then serves as the outcome variable in the Random Forest Regression model Classification Constructing Synthetic effluent SNC Status For ease of exposition and interpretation we use a simplified effluent SNC status definition that roughly approximates the federal guidelines for the formal effluent SNC calculation More specifically we construct a synthetic effluent SNC ag for permittees that aligns with the effluent exceedance conditions EPA uses to determine SNC The ag is applied under the following two conditions First if a permittee discharges beyond its permitted levels by or for any two category and parameters respectively then the permittee triggers a serious SNC violation Second if a permittee has four or more effluent discharges that exceed their limits in any amount over in the past two quarters they trigger the chronic SNC violation ag More formally we can represent these two SNC violation status triggers as follows First where G is the indicator function for serious violations based on observed parameter exceedance values and thresholds of each category within a given permit this ag can be determined as if otherwise Where A G is the indicator function for chronic violations the second ag is determined as A if otherwise For each permit if there is any pollutant with or A where is the number of measurements for across all monitoring locations in the past two quarters then the permit will be agged as being in effluent SNC These constructed permit-level effluent SNC flags and the probability of a given permit in being agged with this label serve as the outcome variable in the Random Forest classification model This synthetic effluent SNC ag approximates the more complex SNC function reasonably well as indicated by the of overlapping classifications we determined from our measure compared against the EPAs records Simulated Risk-Based Permit Selection Based on the outputs of each model we select facilities to target for compliance efforts as follows In the classification approach we use the probability of being in the SNC status as the risk score to rank all permits We then select the top of those permits following the NCI objective to halve the SNC rate In the regression approach we use the predicted weighted sums of exceedance percentages to rank all permits We then select the same number of permittees from the top fraction of the rank-ordered list This risk-selection procedure simulates actual deployment possibilities under the NCI The federal EPA and state partners are exploring a range of risk-targeted interventions eg notifications compliance advisories inspections that would shift enforcement resources toward such risk-scored facilities with the goal of improving environmental We note that not all effluent Violations that meet the Chronic or TRC threshold are identified as effluent SNC under the official EPA ag For example a permit may also independently trigger a permit compliance schedule event violation that supersedes an effluent SNC in EPAs SNC categorization hierarchy In addition not all effluent violations are eligible for detection as SNC with the full set of criteria documented in protection Our aim is thus to study what the distributive impact of regression vs classification approaches might be for a set of facilities targeted in such interventions Evaluating Distributive Impacts To evaluate distributive impacts we rst link each permit back to facility-level information indicating in which census block group CBG each permit is located Next we associate each permittee with demographic data corresponding to their CBG as made available in the ACS data or in the case of the population density information as extracted from ECHO We then evaluate the distributions of features associated with the targeted facilities in each targeting protocol using two-sided C-tests for means Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for distributions and the Wilcoxon ranked sum test for medians Finally we graphically represent the differences between select demographics of the targeted or risk-selected permittees in quantile-quantile plots RESULTS General vs Individual Permits Although taking the step to expand the purview of compliance initiatives to include minors for the rst time marks an ambitious seven-fold expansion in the number of facilities under such an initiative we now consider how delaying the inclusion of the approximately general facilities in the National Compliance Initiative can shape the distribution of environmental compliance resources Figure demonstrates the gaps created by focusing the NCI only on individual permits To illustrate the variation in state-level permitting decisions even for the same type of facility Figure focuses on a subset of wastewater treatment facilities across the United States namely those that manage sewage as opposed to industrial effluent The top panel maps these sewage-handling wastewater treatment plants across the US colored by whether they have general orange or individual permits blue and the bottom panel zooms in on the neighboring states of Virginia and North Carolina illustrating seemingly arbitrary differences in state permitting schemes Furthermore Figure suggests that the variation in individual versus general designation are not necessarily driven by differences in the amounts of effluent characteristics that are permitted under each type Figure plots the distribution of effluent limits ie the maximum permitted value for each discharge parameter for six common water discharge parameters across the general and individual permittees shown in Figure The substantial overlapping regions between the effluent limits suggests there is significant overlap between the effluent characteristics of these two types of facilities Last the exclusion of general permits from the NCI is not necessarily because general permittees are always in This test is also known as the Mann-Whitney test We acknowledge there are legitimate reasons distinguishing the issuance of individual versus general permits General permits are intended to be easier cheaper faster as they were designed for more standardized types of operations that in principle should require less scrutiny Where used individual permits typically build o the guidelines set in general permits but are then customized to the types of effluent that a individual permittee may have in addition to the effluent common among standard general permits Figure a As of FY of wastewater treatment facilities across the US responsible for handling sewage have general permits rather than individual permits and therefore do not count for the National Compliance Initiative b How wastewater treatment facilities are classified varies within and across states as seen by the permit classification for Wastewater Treatment Plants that handle sewage in the two neighboring states of Virginia and North Carolina compliance Table presents the compliance statistics for general and individual permits calculating SNC as if the NCI were applied to all facilities Roughly of individual permits overall that is across major and minor permits are in effluent SNC compared to of general permits although that difference is largely a function of higher non-reporting among general permits The overall SNC rate between the two permit types is comparable In short due to discretionary differences between state permitting protocols the NCI excludes from its purview a large number of functionally similar facilities What impact does this policy decision have Table provides some descriptive information to understand the impacts of rst expanding the scope of the NCI to include individual permits and second to delay the inclusion of general facilities First based on eligible facilities we can see that including individual minor facilities shifted the mass of attention towards lower density areas with fewer minority populations on average Second general permits exceed the total number of individual permits by nearly a third Third both the general and individual categories have large numbers of wastewater treatment plants which highlights that very Lead total as Pb kg/day Phosphorus total as P kg/day Solids total suspended kg/day day C kg/day carbonaceous day C kg/day Flow rate Million Gallons per Day Limit Values In Quantities D en si ty Sewage Permit Type General Individual Figure Discharge limits for sewage-handling wastewater treatment plants that handle sewage but are permitted under the general n or individual n category are broadly similar across a series of six commonly reported discharge parameters similar facilities can be subject or exempted from the NCI solely due to permitting vagaries Third and most importantly general permittees tend to be located in denser areas with a higher share of minority individuals relative to the average individual permit included in the scope of the original NCI This shows that the design decision to exclude general permittees from the NCI itself had disparate impact shifting environmental remediation efforts toward non-minority regions Last while one rationale for excluding general permittees might be that their effluent SNC rate is much lower as stated above the total SNC rate is comparable due to high rates of failures to submit Such non-submissions are themselves subject to penalties under the Clean Water Act reflecting the importance of information reporting under the Act Oracle Test As a rst benchmark we consider the oracle test assuming that the decision maker is omniscient about effluent exceedances and SNC status in the target quarter FY-Q As described above we select the top riskiest half of permittees expected to be in SNC n on the basis of that full information and compare the distributive effects using a selection rule that focuses on top exceedances versus SNC status This comparison mimics the regression approach which focuses on top polluters regardless of SNC status and the classification approach which focuses on SNC status regardless of the level of pollution To understand the distributive effects of choosing one approach over the other the left panels of Figure depict plots comparing quantiles of attributes from risk-selected facilities based on classification G-axis and regression -axis Identical selections would line up along the -degree line Instead we observe substantial evidence of the potential for General permits include far more stormwater permits which for instance regulate stormwater from construction and industrial activities The dominance of stormwater permits also suggests part of the challenge of effectively monitoring and managing their violations while some preventative measures may be taken to reduce violations stormwater SNCs may stem at least in part from stochastic weather events An effluent violation can only be ascertained if the permittee submits the DMR Thus the effluent SNC rate is a function of the high rates of failure to submit The true effluent SNC rate would likely be much higher in the counterfactual where all general permittees submitted their DMRs General Number of Facilities effluent SNC Facility Type Wastewater Stormwater Major Demographics Avg Population Density Avg Median Income Avg Percent Minority Table Characteristics of General Individual Major and Individual Minor Permits Categories not exclusive All differences statistically significant p between general and individual permits and for population density and percent minority between the two types of individual permits disparate impact based on this oracle test The regression model selects a subset of permittees with higher shares of minority populations located in more densely populated areas than the classification counterpart top and bottom left panels These distributional shifts are statistically significant -value based on all three tests for both features The regression model also focuses on a higher fraction of areas agged as vulnerable versus in effect suggesting that a higher share of communities in which these regression-selected facilities are located already have a series of preexisting exposures and vulnerabilities The oracle test illustrates the potential for disparate impact based on the choice of regression versus classification but the impact of model-based inferences is less clear Depending on the model actual risk models may amplify or attenuate the distributive impact identified in the oracle Performance Assessment We provide brief performance statistics of the RF regression and classification models here Figure provides a calibration plot for the classification model in left panel binned by deciles As expected the classification model is properly calibrated with bins falling along the -degree line The classification model has an Area Under the ROC Curve AUC of and an AUC on the precision-recall PR curve of The right panel plots deciles of predicted effluent exceedances on the G-axis against the difference between observed and predicted exceedances on the -axis from the RF regression model The regression predictions perform well along all but the most extreme bin which is driven by a small number of extreme outliers Including all data points results in an RMSE of compared to a mean imputation baseline of Once omitting the top of outliers however the RMSE drops to As a sanity check we examine how facilities that were risk-selected either via regression or classification perform in the test period on SNC and exceedance or overage percentage Table That is they are agged as in the th percentile or above of the EJScreen Monitoring Tool Predicted

plot for classification model and binned difference between observed and predicted values for the regression model shows that on average the regression model identifies more permittees with large overages aggregated over all parameters whereas the classification model identifies more permittees agged as with the effluent SNC status Comparing the risk-selected samples also reveals that the models agreed for roughly half of the selected facilities The remaining differences between what we observe in these two protocols are thus all attributable to the characteristics of the remaining facilities Appendix B provides more detail on the work and other performance statistics Model Overage SNC Status Regression classification Table Comparing Model Performance on Substantive Measures The Regression model identifies more permittees with large predicted and actual overages aggregated over all parameters and the classification model identifies more permittees with the effluent SNC status ag Disparate Impact of Model-Based Selections We now return to the measures of disparate impact and add these to compare against the oracle test in Figure The right column presents the distributive shift for proportion minority income and population density from classification G-axis vs regression axis As before these represent the risk-selected facilities under either model Under no distributional shift the plot should line up along the -degree line Instead we observe statistically significant differences in the means medians and distributions of the percent minority and the population density measures The extent of the differences amounts to on average a difference -value in the share of communities with minority populations targeted under the regression-focused approach going from approximately in the classification up to under regression The plots further reveal that the shift appears to be uniform across the distribution We observe no statistically distinguishable differences between the median household income of the permittees targeted under regression versus classification with both median household incomes resting around SD The final panel reveals that classification directs relatively more attention to permittees in areas with about individuals per square mile within a mile radius of the permittee with a notable set of permittees with people per square mile or below whereas regression focuses on permittees in areas with population densities that are on average nearly people per square mile and above Importantly regression prioritizes several facilities in some of the densest places in the United States including nine permittees located New York Massachusetts and California that feature over people per square mile within a mile radius of those facilities These results show that targeting environmental protection based on the intensity of pollution exceedances would focus on areas with higher shares of minority populations in denser more urban areas CONCLUSION In this paper we have drawn upon data on Clean-Water Act permits historical pollution discharge and compliance records institutional knowledge of regulatory implementation details from extensive engagement with federal EPA and census data to demonstrate how algorithmic design for environmental enforcement can identify levers that can exacerbate or mitigate disparate impact We simulate which sets of permittees would be targeted if EPA seeks to focus on those with the highest emission overages regression compared with selecting permittees the highest probability of falling into the SNC status classification and we show how an objective that focuses on exceedance intensity would redirect compliance efforts away from more rural smaller facilities and towards permittees situated in more densely populated environments with higher shares of minority individuals This ending holds with both observed values the oracle test as well as the ML-based risk assessment models to enable prospective interventions that prevent and reduce significant noncompliance While we believe that this work adds an important case study of algorithmic fairness in the wild so to speak we also acknowledge a few important limitations First mirroring the definition of SNC our models implicitly assume that every additional percent exceedance can be compared with another percent exceedance of the same category A facility with a unit limit of nitrogen that discharges units counts equally towards the SNC status trigger and exceedance percent estimation as a facility with a unit limit of phosphorous that discharges units Absent other mechanisms to put these different effluent types and amounts on a common scale of harm we in effect assume that pollution limits were established with solid knowledge about which amounts pollution would result in social and environmental damages in a given area We recognize that the extent of harm from additional pollution may be nonlinear and vary considerably with baseline levels of water quality impairment and vulnerability across regions To capture some measure of vulnerability we include the EJScreen ag into our assessment of distributive implications Even though the EJScreen ag is a coarse instrument it attempts to measure areas likely face a high degree of pre-existing cumulative exposures and risks Nonetheless the goal of translating the coarse measure of Oracle Classification Oracle Regression Rank Sum Test Percent Minority CBG Classification Regression Rank Sum Test Percent Minority CBG Oracle

presented in parentheses for rank sum C and tests effluent percent exceedances into the social and environmental harms of the context they are discharged into is an important if challenging open area of research Second while we select facilities based on these coarse risk or exceedance estimates we do not have insight into the types of enforcement actions based on this prioritization and their causal effects Compliance efforts can run the gamut from inexpensive informational interventions to careful but costly on-the-ground facility inspections and monitoring The extent to which this list translates into meaningful changes in conditions on the ground may rest heavily on the extent to which the discharge in question poses harms to the communities exposed to it as well as the feasibility and costs of remediating the noncompliance Notwithstanding these limitations the core of our argument is essentially thus the use of seemingly simple and clear objectives such as the reduction in SNC can mask important policy decisions In selecting the SNC rate among individual permittees as the measure for evaluating the performance of a signature national compliance initiative the EPA implicitly makes a decision about whose compliance is important what types of violations should be treated equivalently and what types of compliance efforts should be encouraged Although we cannot claim that every additional unit of pollution has an equal impact due to changes in distance from population centers changes in concentration stemming from dilution as well as mixing of pollution once in contact with waterways etc our investigation has clarified a basic trade-off Conventionally whether to take an enforcement action against the facilities that are barely out of compliance or facilities that are seriously out of compliance might involve a calculus of the resource cost Barely noncompliant facilities for example might be cheaper to get back into compliance Algorithmic design shows that there is another dimension the largest polluters are also more likely to reside in vulnerable and disproportionately minority communities By focusing the NCI on the violation rate among individual permits the NCI bypasses a potentially important mechanism for reducing disproportionate harms Third although we focus on effluent-related SNC in this paper the NCI as a whole covers the full range of reasons why a facility may trigger that label specifically as presaged by Table over half of permits in SNC fall into this category due to nonreporting of their DMRs And if these nonreporting facilities are already substantively in compliance with their permits the NCI could then potentially be achieved without actually reducing pollution amounts In actuality many believe nonreporting tends to mask a variety of other problems including permit exceedances Accordingly our approach may well underestimate the distributive implications that the overall SNC-focused NCI has compared to a specific discharge-over-limit reduction goal focused on reducing harms in the places where they matter most Last while our models approximate what government agencies are deploying the models could be improved in a number of respects The RF regression for instance does not perform well for some of the extreme outliers we observe in the data forms of robust regression would help to reduce the influence of such data points While we have tried one form of dimensionality reduction with For more on these challenges see Olmstead ARIMA sequence-based models may enable better utilization of the underlying panel time series structure of the monthly DMR data Nonetheless the application illustrates some of the key challenges in machine learning with the complexities of real world government data and application To conclude as government agencies expand the use of algorithmic decision-making in guiding and executing policy decisions the many micro policy and engineering choices on which the top-line objectives are implemented can themselves generate unintended impacts Our research has added a case study in an important area of environmental sustainability and regulatory enforcement where algorithmic and policy design may be inextricably intertwined Algorithmic fairness in the regulatory state may require grappling with the policy objectives and design themselves but can also if carefully done shed light on the impacts of prior policy choices Last this case study illustrates how academic-agency collaborations can ensure greater attention to identifying and mitigating disparate impact in algorithmic decision making
