Meaningful Information and the Right to Explanation This article addresses an active debate in policy industry academia and the media about whether and to what extent Europes new General Data Protection Regulation GDPR grants individuals a right to explanation of automated decisions There is no single neat statutory provision labelled the right to explanation in the GDPR But nor is such a right illusory Responding to two prominent papers that in turn conjure and critique the right to explanation in the context of automated decision-making we advocate a return to the text of the GDPR Articles of the GDPR provide individuals with rights to meaningful information about the logic involved in automated decisions This is a right to explanation whether one uses the phrase or not The first paper we address Goodman and Flaxman is an explainer for a technical audience It asserts that the GDPR creates a right to explanation but does not flesh out the argument In response Wachter et al published an extensive critique arguing against the existence of such a right Our article is partially concerned with responding to the arguments of Wachter et al Our corrective involves two major strands First we show that Wachter et al do not fairly interpret the concept of explanation instead choosing to attack only a narrowed version of it amounting to an ex post explanation of a specific decision At the same time the paper claims that the GDPR does support a right to be informed which is defined as an ex ante explanation of system functionality in other words still an explanation Second the argument relies on an analytical framework that cleaves ex ante and ex post decisions and system functionality and specific decisions We demonstrate that this framework is built on incorrect legal and technical assumptions In addition to responding to the existing scholarly contributions our article articulates a positive conception of the right to explanation located in the text and purpose of the GDPR We take a position that the right should be interpreted functionally flexibly and should at a minimum enable a data subject to exercise his or her rights under the GDPR and human rights law Keywords Automated decisions data processing data protection law explanation interpretability machine learning
