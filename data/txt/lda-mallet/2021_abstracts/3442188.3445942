The Algorithmic Leviathan Arbitrariness Fairness and Opportunity in Algorithmic Decision Making Systems Automated decision-making systems implemented in public life are typically standardized One algorithmic decision-making system can replace thousands of human deciders Each of the humans so replaced had her own decision-making criteria some good some bad and some arbitrary Is such arbitrariness of moral concern We argue that an isolated arbitrary decision need not morally wrong the individual whom it misclassifies However if the same algorithms are applied across a public sphere such as hiring or lending a person could be excluded from a large number of opportunities This harm persists even when the automated decision-making systems are fair on standard metrics of fairness We argue that such arbitrariness at scale is morally problematic and propose technically informed solutions that can lessen the impact of algorithms at scale and so mitigate or avoid the moral harms we identify Social and professional topics Computing  technology policy Applied computing Law Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence KEYWORDS opportunity arbitrariness fairness machine learning algorithmic decision making automated hiring
