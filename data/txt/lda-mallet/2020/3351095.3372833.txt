What to account for when accounting for algorithms A systematic literature review on algorithmic accountability As research on algorithms and their impact proliferates so do calls for scrutiny/accountability of algorithms A systematic review of the work that has been done in the field of algorithmic accountability has so far been lacking This contribution puts forth such a systematic review following the PRISMA statement English articles from the period up to and including were collected and extracted from Web of Science and SCOPUS using a recursive query design coupled with computational methods The articles were prioritized and ordered using affinity mapping resulting in core articles which are presented in this contribution The recursive search strategy made it possible to look beyond the term algorithmic accountability That is the query also included terms closely connected to the theme eg ethics and AI regulation of algorithms This approach allows for a perspective not just from critical algorithm studies but an interdisciplinary overview drawing on material from data studies to law and from computer science to governance studies To structure the material Bovenss widely accepted definition of accountability serves as a focal point The material is analyzed on the five points Bovens identified as integral to accountability its arguments on the actor the forum the relationship between the two the content and criteria of the account and finally the consequences which may result from the account The review makes three contributions First an integration of accountability theory in the algorithmic accountability discussion Second a cross-sectoral overview of the that same discussion viewed in light of accountability theory which pays extra attention to accountability risks in algorithmic systems Lastly it provides a definition of algorithmic accountability based on accountability theory and algorithmic accountability literature CONCEPTS

Algorithmic accountability algorithmic systems data-driven governance accountability theory INTRODUCTION From aviation to recruiting it seems no sector is unaffected by the implementation of computational systems Such computational or algorithmic systems were once heralded as a way to remove human bias and to relieve human labor Despite their aims such systems were found capable of inflicting minor to serious or even lethal harms as well be it intentional/unintentional Examples of drastic situations abound In two of Boeings planes were presumably downed by software Volkswagen designed their cars software to automatically cheat emission-testing Governmental systems initially designed to help now profile and discriminate the poor Amazon created a recruiting system which systematically discriminated against women as the training data was made up of historical hiring data in which males were vastly overrepresented The effects of these systems may be intentional eg Volkswagens emission fraud but more often are unintended side-effects some of which may have far-reaching consequences such as the death of Boeing passengers Central to such computational systems are algorithms those sets of instructions fed to a computer to solve particular problems p As algorithms are increasingly applied within a rapidly expanding variety of fields and institutions affecting our society in crucial ways new ways to discern and track bias presuppositions and prejudices built into or resulting from algorithms are crucial The assessment of algorithms in this matter has come to be known as algorithmic accountability Algorithmic accountability has gained a lot of traction recently due to the changed legislative and regulatory context of data practice with the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR several lawsuits eg A and the integration with open government initiatives p Examples of such governmental initiatives abound the city of New York installed an Automated Decisions Systems Task Force to evaluate algorithmic systems and the Dutch Open Government Action Plan includes a segment on Open Algorithms Within civil society and academia there are also many laudable initiatives eg advocating for more algorithmic accountability yet a thorough and systematic definition of the term lacks and it has not been systematically embedded within the existing body of work on accountability Nevertheless there have been numerous works over the past decades which touch upon the theme of algorithmic accountability albeit using different terms and stemming from different disciplines eg Thus while the term may be new the theme certainly stands in a much older tradition of for instance computational accountability eg and literate programming advocating much of the same points Algorithmic accountability is thus not a new phenomenon and accountability even less so To avoid reinventing the wheel we should look to these discussions and to embed algorithmic accountability firmly within accountability theory This contribution presents the preliminary results of a systematic review on algorithmic accountability following the PRISMA statement English articles from the period up to and including were collected and extracted from Web of Science and SCOPUS using a recursive query design see appendix B for an explanation of the methodology coupled with computational methods The material was ordered and prioritized using affinity mapping and the core articles which were identified as the most important will be presented in this contribution This recursive search strategy made it possible to look beyond the term algorithmic accountability and instead approach it as a theme That is the query also included terms closely connected to the theme eg ethics and AI regulation of algorithms This approach allows for an interdisciplinary perspective which appreciates the multifaceted nature of algorithmic accountability In order the structure the material accountability theory is used as a focal point This review makes three contributions an integration of accountability theory in the algorithmic accountability discussion a cross-sectoral overview of that same discussion viewed in light of accountability theory which pays extra attention to accountability risks in algorithmic systems and it provides a definition of algorithmic accountability based on accountability theory and algorithmic accountability literature In Appendix A the reader can find concrete situations which highlight some problems with accountability These will be referred to in the corresponding sections of this paper ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALGORITHMIC SYSTEMS Defining accountability Making governmental conduct transparent is now viewed as good governance As such accountability efforts can often be said to have a virtuous nature However a side effect to such accountability efforts is the sunlight is the best disinfectant electric light the most efficient policeman logic In having to be transparent about ones work one starts to behave better here we see accountability used as a mechanism to facilitate better behavior Both logics can co-exist Accountability as a term can be used in a broad and narrow sense Typically though the term refers to what Bovens p describes as A clarification of the differentiation between term and theme can be found in the methodology appendix B a relationship between an actor and a forum in which the actor has an obligation to explain and to justify his or her conduct the forum can pose questions and pass judgement and the actor may face consequences Thus an actor be they an individual a group or an organization is required to explain their actions before a particular audience the forum This account is bound to particular criteria The audience can then ask for clarifications and additional explanations and subsequently decides if the actor has displayed proper conduct from which repercussions may or may not follow What is denoted with algorithmic accountability is this kind of accountability relationship where the topic of explanation and/or justification is an algorithmic system So what then is an algorithmic system Defining algorithmic systems As noted above algorithms are basically instructions fed to a computer p They are technical constructs that are simultaneously deeply social and cultural Appreciating this entanglement of various perspectives and enactments of algorithms this contribution sees algorithms not as solely technical objects but rather as socio-technical systems which are embedded in cultures and can be viewed used and approached from different perspectives eg legal technological cultural social This rich set of algorithmic multiples cited in can enhance accountability rather than limit it The interdisciplinary systematic literature review presented in the remainder of this contribution bundles knowledge and insight from a broad range of disciplines and appreciates the entanglements and multiples that are invariably a characteristic of algorithmic system interaction WHAT TO ACCOUNT FOR WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR ALGORITHMS This paper draws Bovenss widely accepted definition of accountability as a relation between actor and forum is used as a focal point to structure the interdisciplinary articles The material is analyzed on the five points Bovenss identified as integral to accountability its arguments on the actor the forum the relationship between the two the content and criteria of the account and finally the consequences which may result from the account Below I will discuss the findings of each of these five points Actor A first question would be who should be rendering the account or who is responsible eg Aside from such a general specification Martin and Yu et al argue that one needs to specifically address two different questions For instance who is responsible for the harm that the system may inflict when it is working correctly Who is responsible when it is working incorrectly These questions are often not readily answerable as the organization who is using the algorithmic system need not be the developing party In many cases organizations Actor is used in the accountability-sense here rather than in a Latourian way Where an ANT-like actor is discussed the term actant will be used to avoid confusion Please note that this contribution makes use of the singular they commission a third party to develop a system for them which complicates the accountability relationship When is the developer to be held accountable and when should we call the organization commissioning and using the application to the stand p cf A Levels of actors Answering these questions is far from straightforward In any given situation one may distinguish different actors on different levels of organization making a single actor hard to pinpoint For instance we can take the individual developing or using the system as the actor but on higher levels one may also hold the team the department or the organization as a whole accountable In some instances the organization may use a system developed by a third party which complicates the scheme even further cf A In other words locating the actor is often tough and different contexts might even require different kinds of actors for the same subject Bovens describes four types of accountability relations based on the level of the actor individual accountability hierarchical accountability collective accountability and corporate accountability Individual accountability means that individuals conduct is held to be their own In other words when one is not shielded from investigation by their superiors or organization p Hierarchical accountability describes the situation in which the persons heading the organization department or team are held accountable for that greater whole p Collective accountability rests on the idea that one can hold a member of a group of organization accountable for the whole of that organization regardless of their function or standing p This kind of accountability relationship is rare in democratic contexts as it is not sophisticated enough to do justice to the many differences that are important in the imputation of guilt shame and blame p We can speak of corporate accountability in situations where an organization as a non-human legal entity is held accountable p This is for instance the case in instances where we speak of the data controller or the developing firm Special attention needs to be given to cases in which there is a third party who for instance has developed a given system for a particular organization especially when the organization is a public institution To illustrate a private company may develop an fraud detection algorithm which scrutinizes people on benefits for a municipality eg Martin argues that in such situations these third party organizations become a voluntary part of the decision system making them members of the community This willful membership creates an obligation to respect the norms of the community as a member This then raises the question how can one make sure that a third party respects the norms and values of the context in which the system will be deployed see also Roles of actors Actors can also be distinguished by their roles Arguably the person drafting the specifications of the system will be put forth as an actor in different situations than a developer of the system or its user Thus roles can also be said to be a factor in determining the appropriate actor for particular situations We can distinguish between three kinds of actor roles decision makers developers and users Let us first look at decision makers those who decide about the system its specifications and crucial factors Coglianese and Lehr p note that it is important to consider who within an agency actually wields algorithm-specifying power There is much at stake in balancing which individual gets to make these decisions precisely because higher-level employees the authors specifically discuss public administration are more accountable to others so they cannot be unknowledgeable about critical details of the algorithm Here it seems Coglianese and Lehr refer to hierarchical accountability They continue to argue that introducing algorithmic systems may upend work processes in a fundamental way especially when algorithms express value judgements quantitatively as much is lost in that translation p Who in an organization is allowed to systematically decide how such value judgements will be structurally translated into a number Coupled to this is the question who gets to decide when an algorithm is good enough at what it is supposed to do Who for instance gets to decide what acceptable error rates are cf A Developers are often seen as the responsible party for such questions as they are knowledgeable as to the design decisions and are in a unique position to inscribe the algorithm with the value-laden biases as well as roles and responsibilities of the algorithmic decision Kraemer Van Overveld and Peterson p are like-minded as they note that since the developers cannot avoid making ethical judgments about what is good and bad it is reasonable to maintain that software designers are morally responsible for the algorithms they design Thus developers implicitly or explicitly make value judgments which are woven into the algorithmic system Here the logic is that the choices should be left to the user as much as possible The more those choices are withheld from users the heavier the accountability burden for the developing entity is This does imply however that developers and/or designers should also have the adequate sensitivity for ethical problems which may arise from the technology p Decisions about the balancing of error rates are not often part of specifications which means developers have to be able to recognize and flag these ethical considerations before they can deliberate with stakeholders where needed and account for those choices Another problem arises from what is termed the accountability gap between the designers control and algorithms behavior p Especially in learning algorithms which are vastly complex the developer or the developing team as a whole may not control or predict the systems behavior adequately p Special attention has to be given to the users of the system and their engagement with it First of all one may wonder who is the user of the system Secondly we may ask what is the intensity of human involvement In some cases implementing algorithmic systems comes at the loss of human involvement eg In general we can distinguish between three types of systems human-in-the-loop human-on-the-loop human-out-of-the-loop This typology originally stems from AI warfare systems but is productively applied in the context of algorithmic accountability Human-in-the-loop systems can be said to augment human practice Such systems make suggestions about possible actions no action will be undertaken without human consent In other words these are decision-guidance processes p Human-on-the-loop systems are monitored by human agents but instead of the default being no unless consent is given this kind of system will proceed with their task unless halted by the human agent Finally there are human-out-of-the-loop systems where no human oversight is taking place at all We then speak of automated decisionmaking processes p Arguably these different kinds of involvement have consequences for the accounts which can be rendered by the user-as-actor Thus one aspect of an account of algorithms should be the measure of human involvement Forum As one sets out to account for their practice it is important to consider to whom that account is directed Kemper and Kolkman argue that one cannot give account without the audience understanding the subject matter and being able to engage with the material in a critical way Their argument for the critical audience shows parallels with Bovenss articulation of accountability in which the forum can pose questions and pass judgement p What shape can this critical audience take then The EUs General Data Protection Regulation GDPR hailed partly for its right to explanation may point towards the individual citizen as the forum in the context of algorithmic accountability p In other cases one may need to give account to ones peers or the organization accounts to an auditor p Different fora can be interwoven but each requires different kinds of explanations and justifications cf Bovens describes five kinds of accountability relations based on the type of forum political accountability eg ministerial responsibility cf A legal accountability eg judges cf A administrative accountability eg auditors inspecting a system professional accountability eg insight by peers cf A and social accountability eg civil society Political accountability can be said to be the inverse and direct consequence of delegation from a political representative to civil servants p As tasks are delegated the civil servant has to account for their conduct to their political superior What has changed is that not only do politicians delegate to civil servants now but civil servants themselves start to delegate to and/or are replaced by algorithmic systems This change is one that has been identified before by Bovens and Zouridis in connection to the discretionary power of civil servants Bovens and Zouridis note that civil servants discretion can be heavily curtailed by ICT systems within the government Building on Lipskys conception of the street-level bureaucrat they make a distinction between street-level bureaucracy screen-level bureaucracy and system-level bureaucracy Each of these types of bureaucracy allow for different measures of discretionary power of civil servants Whereas street-level bureaucrats have a great measure of discretion screen-level bureaucrats discretionary power is much more restricted System-level bureaucracy allows for little to no discretionary power as the system has replaced the civil servant entirely The different forms of bureaucracy are coupled to the way in which systems are playing a role within work processes As Bovens and Zouridis note the more decisive the systems outcome is the less discretion the user has Delegation to systems is thus not a neutral process but one that has great consequences for the way in which cases are dealt with and border cases especially Delegation to systems is important to consider for two other reasons as well First following Bovens logic of delegation and/or accountability it would make sense to start to hold the algorithmic system accountable There are many efforts to make algorithms explainable and intelligible Guidotti et al for instance note that we can speak of four different types of efforts to make a wicked algorithm intelligible These four approaches also correspond to efforts discussed in the field of explainable AI XAI eg Explaining the model or global interpretability Explaining the outcome or local interpretability Inspecting the black box Creating a transparent box An explanation of the model is an account of the global logic of the system whereas an explanation of the outcome is a local and in the case of personalized decisions personal Inspecting the black box can take many shapes such as reconstructing how the black box works internally and visualizing the results cf A In other cases auditors may be used to scrutinize the system p Another approach would be to construct a transparent box system which does not use opaque or implicit predictors but rather explicit and visible ones Such technical transparency of the working of the system can be helpful but in itself should be considered insufficient for the present discussion as accountability transparency The transparent workings of a system do not tell you why this system was deemed good enough at decision making or why it was deemed desirable to begin with Nor does it tell us anything about its specifications or functions nor who decided on these nor why p Whereas transparency is thus passive ie see for yourself how it works accountability requires a more active and involved stance ie let me tell you how it works and why Second whereas in the context of the government civil servants have the flexibility to subtly shift the execution of their tasks in light of the present political context systems do not have such sensitivity Often such systems are not updated to the contemporary political context and thus lock in values for the duration of their lifecycle cf A Accounts on algorithms are thus key as algorithmic systems are both instruments and outcome of governance following They are thus tools to implement particular governance strategies but are also themselves a form of governance Thus accountability is crucial if we wish to avoid governance effects through obsolete values/choices embedded in algorithmic systems Legal accountability is usually based on specific responsibilities formally or legally conferred upon authorities p Much of the actions systems will undertake are not up for deliberation as they are enshrined in law p There are thus already laws and regulations which apply to systems and can be leveraged to ensure compliance However as Coglianese and Lehr p note laws do not prescribe all aspects of algorithmic systems For instance there is no one set acceptable level of error Rather the acceptability strongly depends on the context and use of the system cf A There is thus also a matter of discretion on the part of the system designers on how one operates within the gaps of the judicial code in these cases ethical guidance needs to come from the human developer decision maker or user p This does raise some questions with regards to the ethical sensitivity of these human agents As it stands technical experts may not be adequately aware of the laws and legal system which they operate in On the side of the legal system there may also be insufficient capacity to understand algorithmic systems We see this in cases where lawyers and expert witnesses must be able to inform their evidence with the working and design of the system Algorithmic systems thus require new kinds of expertise from lawyers judges and legal practitioners in general eg p as they need to be able to assess the sometimes conflicting laws and public values within those systems which themselves can be vastly complicated and rely on a large amount of connected data sources Meaningful insight in this interwoven socio-technical system is needed to decide whether these values are properly balanced and adequately accounted for Yet it can be particularly hard to decide on what may provide meaningful insight and what will result in opacity through transparency While the data gathering phase is quite well regulated the analysis and use phases of data are underregulated leaving judges to fend for themselves What might prove to be crucial is however the socio-technical aspect of the system For as has been discussed above algorithmic systems do not set their own objective functions nor are they completely outside human control An algorithm by its very definition must have its parameters and uses specified by humans p Eventually someone has made choices about the system and mapping these pivotal moments might help in resolving a transparency overload of information These complications of expertise in the legal forum deserve special attention as it has a facilitating function The legal framework provides many other fora eg civil society with the means to enforce accountability for instance through freedom of information FOI requests Though as Fink notes FOI requests often have a limited use due to the reserved exemptions Nevertheless jurisprudence and regulation are often enablers to build cases and enforce accountability As such the legal system is particularly important for other accountability arrangements as well Administrative accountability refers to a wide range of quasilegal forums exercising independent and external administrative and financial supervision and control p Examples of such administrative accountability fora are safety certificators accident investigators auditors p and regulators Domain-specific authorities are another form of administrative fora Many authors note that adequate administrative authorities are lacking and argue these should be instituted eg The precise shape these administrative authorities should take is largely left underdeveloped however Professional accountability deals with those kinds of accountability relations between a professional and their peer group p Peer group is here interpreted in a loose fashion to denote fora within ones organization cf Acknowledging internal fora is important as accountability practices need to be entrenched in the organizations structure in order for external accountability to be viable Professional fora outside of the organization may be associations of particular disciplines Here an accountability relationship may comprise the adherence to the many guidelines and standards articulated by such organizations eg Some of these standards are norms or best practices to that function as accountability mechanisms others are moral imperatives Brennan-Marquez p for example notes how explanatory standards create incentives for institutional actors to understand the tools they employ Diakopoulos p for instance illustrates the moral ethos which some of these guidelines advocate quite apt with the ACM Code of Ethics for software engineering First and foremost is that software engineers should act in the public interest to be accountable and responsible for their work to moderate private interests with public good to ensure safety and privacy to avoid deception and to consider the disadvantaged The general moral imperatives of ACM include avoid harm to others be fair and take action not to discriminate and respect the privacy of others Let that sink in Here we see how such guidelines do not lean on an idea of accountability as a mechanism but rather on accountability as a virtue Another type of professional accountability may deal with the modularity and ecological nature of algorithms Algorithms never exist in a void but rather are dependent on one another Thus there is also needs to be an accountability between developers of dependent systems Torresen p notes for instance the importance of control mechanisms between systems which thus require a coordination between different teams of developers/decision makers/users Lastly there is the accountability among different kinds of professionals To illustrate the developer of a system can also be said to be accountable to the user and/or decision maker about their embedded value judgements for instance cf Finally Bovens p discusses social accountability Social accountability can take the form of more direct accountability relations between public agencies on the one hand and clients citizens and civil society on the other hand Fora connected to this kind of accountability are for instance NGOs and interest groups but also individual citizens In other words this kind of accountability relationship deals with the wider society Such accountability is key as humans ie developers users of the system do not only shape the algorithm but the algorithm also shapes humans developers users subjects and society p Rahwan notes in this light that we perhaps should not just have a human-in-the-loop but also enforce a social contract in which values of stakeholders are negotiated In this way he argues we can keep society-in-the-loop and safeguard public values Similarly Fink p argues that algorithms should be made inspectable for a broad range of people and Janssen and Kuk p note that citizens should be able to scrutinize the governments algorithms The accountability relationship Accountability relationships between actor and forum can as we have seen come in several different shapes levels extents of disclosure and discussion and differing severities of consequences Yet all these relationships follow a particular rhythm as they all go through three phases p The first is the information phase in which the actor gives information to the forum The second phase is the deliberation and discussion of the forum and the questions asked to the actor The final phase concerns the consequences imposed on the actor by the forum These phases can be mapped on a spectrum of quantity/intensity This map the accountability cube is a three-dimensional representation of the three consecutive phases of the accountability arrangement information-giving discussion and the imposing of consequences Each of the phases can be measured separately giving little information does not necessarily entail little discussion amongst the forum for instance As such it makes sense to reflect on each of the three scales apart from one another The cube serves as a tool to assess accountability relationships and to empirically identify accountability deficits and overloads p What the cube does not specify is the shared understanding and perspective on which underlies the accountability relationship After all accountability efforts adequate in one situation may be insufficient in others Bovens Schillemans and t Hart distinguish three normative perspectives on accountability a democratic perspective a constitutional perspective and a learning perspective The democratic perspective departs from the idea that accountability controls and legitimizes government actions by linking them effectively to the democratic chain of delegation p The success of accountability viewed in this light is measured in the degree to which accountability helps to assess the executive branch and in how it works as a mechanism to enforce better behavior A constitutional perspective argues that accountability plays a crucial rule in withstanding the ever-present power concentration and abuse of powers in the executive branch p Successful accountability in such a perspective prevents the abuse of ones executive abilities This perspective is thus concerned with preventing corruption and safeguarding the integrity of the executive branch of government A learning perspective on accountability sees it as a way to provide public office-holders and agencies with feedback-based inducements to increase their effectiveness and efficiency p Here the evaluation standard of accountability concerns the degree in which an accountability arrangement successfully stimulates a focus on societally desirable outcomes The account and its criteria An account can come in many forms and at many moments in the algorithms lifecycle Before we ask what that account should entail let us first dwell on when in the lifecycle and at which point in its deployment the account of the algorithm is could or should be rendered Kroll et al note that traditionally there are two approaches to such evaluations ex ante before the fact and ex post after the fact With algorithms though they and several others posit that accountability should be kept in mind throughout the whole design process Below these standpoints and arguments are discussed in more detail Several scholars point to ex ante evaluations such as impact assessments eg or simulations of behavior Those evaluations are always limited as one cannot foresee the entire process of an algorithms deployment Nevertheless the importance of an accountability relationship arguably also depends on the extent to which it impacts society and individuals and the role of the algorithm in that decision cited in Martin notes that we need to weigh the role of an algorithmic decision in the decision-making process and the impact of the final decision on individuals and the wider society Weighing these factors might provide some guidance on how thorough and extensive future accounts need to be There are also those who explicitly warn against rendering technology accountable before the fact as we risk attributing certainty and responsibility for such a future path to the algorithm p Some argue that we can only meaningfully account for algorithms after the fact because of the nature of big data research which tends to search for new applications for the same data Finally there are those who argue that we need to consider algorithms not just before the fact and/or after the fact Instead one needs to consider the entire process the design the implementation and the evaluation eg Neyland most notably contributed to the design of an ethical surveillance system and employed anthropological and ethnomethodological techniques to give account of the systems development process As he illustrates p Accountability was not accomplished in a single moment by a single person but instead was distributed among project members and the ethics board and across ongoing activities with questions taken back to the project team between meetings and even to be carried forward into future projects after the final ethics board meeting An account of algorithms like the design and the execution of the system unfolds over time As Kate Crawford p argues a sole focus on the outcome of the algorithm forecloses more complex readings of the political spaces in which algorithms function are produced and modified Pivotal moments such as the choice for a particular algorithm eg p and other design decisions such as the weighting of factors p or balancing of fairness deeply influence the system Such decisions are generally informed by tests with different implementations of the system each of these versions inform the final implementation in one way or another The building of an algorithmic system is thus an incremental process of assemblage cf that cannot be equated to a final product at any point which is why disclosing the tests done during the process might be very informative p This contribution sides with the later view in which algorithms are not something that can be assessed in a single moment but that assessment should follow the systems lifecycle As we saw earlier current efforts of making algorithmic systems explainable most notably Explainable AI XAI tend to focus on a technical transparency of specific aspects of the algorithmic system The primary goal of these approaches seems to be the transparency of the system rather than justification of the system cf This is where we touch upon the socio-technical aspect of algorithms This is where the field of XAI and explainable algorithms tends to fall short As such this contribution puts forth a fifth approach which is also practiced/advocated by others such as Neyland and Gasser and Almeida which combines much of these initial four strategies but also affords explanations on the socio-technical nature of the system and respects the temporal unfolding of an algorithmic system Such a socio-technical account can encompass amongst others the algorithmic systems reason for existence the context of the development the effects of the system Yet the sociotechnical account should not be seen as a checklist of everything that needs to be addressed but rather as a modular frame which can help identify and ask the questions crucial in particular contexts Instead of it being a dichotomous either/or a modular account allows for more attention to the crucial considerations and affords paying less attention to less relevant ones Rigorous assessment of every algorithm is unworkable and as politicians have rightly pointed out eg it would be too costly Thus engaging with a modular accountability framework for algorithms could help balance on the one hand the costs and on the other the publics right to information and explanation For instance as a starting point one could pay the most attention to systems which substantially impact individuals Below I will highlight what aspects of a modular account of the socio-technical algorithm could be I divide this account in ex ante in medias res and ex post considerations The different considerations play at different moments in the software development life cycle SDLC The SDLC is made up out of six stages planning analysis design implementation testing/integration and maintenance Planning is about articulating specifications and user needs identifying the desirability of the software and creating a strategy for development Analysis is about translating the specifications and goals of the project to functionalities and identifying and tackling hindrances to a successful software implementation Together these two stages form the ex ante considerations of an algorithmic system for it is only after these stages that that which we tend to understand as software development ie coding implementation testing comes into the picture as part of the in medias res considerations Here we touch upon the SDLC stages of design implementation and testing/integration Design is about creating the architecture for the application Implementation is where the programming of the software happens generally this happens in a modular way that is programmers/teams each work on separate aspects of the system Testing and integration is where the separately produced aspects of the product are connected that is integrated The integrated whole is subsequently tested in vitro for errors bugs and other unforeseen issues Finally there is the maintenance stage where the product is deployed the software needs to maintained and the in vivo bugs needs to be resolved This stage also requires ongoing evaluations of the products quality and relevance It would be tempting to locate the ex post considerations solely with this last maintenance stage but there is in fact much more to it Many important decisions for instance relating to disclosure are arrived upon earlier Moreover the system may inform the planning phase of other to be developed systems An example can be a system which uses decisions of other systems for its own processes Similarly ex ante/in medias res considerations are also less clearly demarcated than an initial mapping would suggest The reason for much of this bleeding over is that the SDLC is non-linear meaning that sometimes one needs to return to earlier stages of the life cycle If for instance tests expose a mismatch between the context and the conceived product one may have to revisit the plan analysis and/or design A distinction in life cycle stages as any distinction is thus always an artificial one as is the separation between ex ante/in medias res/ex post considerations Nevertheless these demarcations help to identify and type what accounts are needed at what stage of the design of the algorithmic socio-technical system Ex ante considerations If we consider the account to be something that tells of and justifies ones conduct we see a great parallel with storytelling What is different between storytelling and rendering an account is that the audience or forum often has the ability to impose sanctions In fact as any parent or child for that matter may tell you there is a thin line between telling what has happened and accounting for what has happened Suddenly a story may have consequences after all once a child innocently tells you about one of their dangerous endeavors of the day Stories like accounts need ingredients in order for them to be sensible At their basis they require a who what where when and why These interrogative words dubbed the are needed for stories because they situate actions what concretely where when who and specify the underlying logic why Because of their situating capacities these words can prove beneficial as formal focal points for accounts as well In the following I will use these to structure the account of ex ante considerations around algorithmic systems making one addition to the list whom it affects As we have seen the sociotechnical algorithmic system is complex There are a lot of groups coming together around the system developers users decision makers but these systems affect people as well for instance citizens/consumers Not all of these groups have a similar amount of power as was discussed earlier in this contribution As such it is beneficial to make a distinction between who is creating/using the system and whom the system affects Who is developing and using the system matters for these persons influence the system A crucial aspect of this first element concerns the question whose values are informing the system McGrath and Gupta note that one of the key distinctions between humans and algorithmic systems is that while humans are able to negotiate conflicting values or rules algorithmic systems need a prioritization of those values One thus needs to account how those values have been balanced There are many ways in which one can think about the balancing of those values such as crowdsourcing or peoples councils Yet this does not entirely solve the problem for as Baum asks whose considerations and norms and values are included in the design of the system and whose are left out Peoples councils or crowdsourced initiatives can strive to but never are a true cross-section of society Keeping this in mind is important for as Kraemer Van Overveld and Peterson p note two persons or more who accept different value-judgements may have a rational reason to design the algorithm differently In other words even in collaboration with stakeholders such as civil society or peoples councils we still need an account of the preferences and choices which inform the systems design Moreover deciding on such a strategy is itself an important design choice This implies two things First there will inevitably be friction between values/value judgements among those involved Second the process in which the decision was made to prioritize one value/value judgement over other possibilities needs to be accounted for that is we must account for the development history of the entire assemblage p Connected to this is the question where the system is being developed and deployed This is even more crucial when a third party is developing the system as they will need to respect the norms and values of the context in which the system will eventually be deployed Moreover joining forces with a third party also limits the options of main organization to render account as commercial interests may prevent certain acts of transparency and/or justification This leads us to a second question of what it is that the organization/organizations set out to create precisely This part of the account should explain what the system is intended to do This is relatively simple as many projects already have specifications of a given system before they are developed A third question is why this system is needed and why it should take the proposed shape This concerns the systems raison dêtre that is why the system is needed in the first place This includes a reflection on what it will change about the existing situation as well as the systems envisioned place within work processes and the organization We must also ask why does it take this form What if any alternative solutions/systems were considered why were those rejected and what makes the arrived upon option the most socially desirable In other words one needs not only justify the development of the system but also its implementation in light of its socio-technical situatedness A fourth element inquires when the system is developed maintained and terminated As algorithmic systems are situated in time they need to be periodically assessed for their contextual fitness It is important to sketch the temporal frame in which the system was originally conceived and justified which provides a touchstone for future evaluations These evaluation moments serve to assess three things p First the need for the system needs to be assessed As the context of the system changes the system may no longer be necessary Secondly the working of the system needs to evaluated Here the specifications and benchmarks if any can serve as a touchstone to assess the effectiveness of the system Third they allow for checking whether the initial assumptions and conditions from which the project departed still hold true The latter point is often glossed over in system evaluation but is crucial Without such evaluation there is a risk that a piece of software locks in a particular interpretation of law or policy for the duration of its use and especially in government contexts provisions to update the software code may not be made p cf A Regular evaluations are thus a necessity to avoid legal and value lock-in As Just and Latzer p note algorithmic systems have a similar effect on society as laws and contracts do As such they too should be open for periodical scrutiny Finally we need to consider whom it affects What groups people and/or situations will the system affect and in what way Accounting for this element can be done by making impact assessments There are many types of impact assessments which might or might not be useful depending on the situation such as but not limited to the Privacy Impact Assessment PIA the Artificial Intelligence Impact Assessment AIIA and the Data Protection Impact Assessment DPIA Each of these focuses on specific aspects of the system and its implications Such impact assessments allow for evaluating proportionality of the system p In medias res considerations Just as stories and accounts are build up out of theWs they also address how things have happened This is where we touch upon the in medias res considerations of design implementation and testing and integration First of all we may ask how does the system work Is it a simple decision tree a rule-based model or is it technically more complex and does it use for instance machine learning Coupled to this we must ask how we can be sure that the system is accurate and fair Especially in cases where machine learning and artificial intelligence in general are used we should be attentive to how they are employed Machine learning tries to learn from historical data to subsequently be applied in new circumstances As such circumstances change and historical data may be imbued with biases systemic or otherwise we need to ask whether the historical training data chosen is a fair and appropriate reference point for this decision Machine learning comes in different flavors but at its two extremes are supervised learning and unsupervised learning In supervised learning the algorithm is trained to recognize particular features or patterns by using labeled data While this increases explainability to a large extent as one knows what categories have been fed surprises may occur cf In unsupervised systems the system is fed unlabeled data and needs to figure out patterns for themselves For both types it is crucial to assess how accurate the system is A lot of this boils down to rendering account of how the system has been tested and what the subsequent results were Moreover are those results used to change anything about the system and if so what is changed and why In line with fairness we may ask how membership of protected classes is kept out of the system In many contexts the consideration of race ethnicity sexuality gender religion and others is not allowed as these are protected under non-discrimination principles Yet with machine learning how can we make sure that the system does not explicitly but more importantly implicitly consider such protected classes for instance by using proxies which correspond to such protected classes eg zip-codes as a stand-in for race and ethnicity particularly in the USA In learning systems one may also wonder whether the training is continuous or whether the model is merely trained before the fact and then deployed In the former case it is appropriate to ask how you will make sure that the learning algorithm will stay fair and accurate We may also wonder how the system settles on a decision There are different types of decision-making processes namely those based on prioritization classification association filtering randomization and prediction Each of these requires answering different kinds of questions We may for instance ask how the system was designed to be used Here we touch upon the agency of the user That is are decisions made by the system automatic or do they guide and/or support human decision-making In other words how much discretion is the user allowed to have We may also wonder how much information the user is given as to the decision/workings of the system and whether or not they can dispute that decision Taking into account the iterative nature of software development we may also question how the system has changed over time why it changed under what circumstances and how extensive those changes were Most importantly one should ask whether or not these changes require a revisit of earlier considerations about the ethics/accountability around the system Ex post considerations Finally we can look back to what has been done and look forward to new situations which may arise Thus we consider questions of whence we came and whither we go It is not uncommon for systems to subtly divert from their original specification As we have seen algorithms are not fixed objects as they are often updated tweaked and/or their behavior changes through machine learning Thus one needs to check whether the system still confirms to the initial specifications and the values which underlie the project One may also wonder what they can explain/disclose about how the systems decision came to be to the data subject or other kinds of fora This also touches upon legal considerations where personal data is concerned The GDPR includes for instance a right to explanation in cases where automated decision-making is involved Consequences Finally the accountability relationship requires that the forum can impose consequences Consequences can come in many different forms which is closely connected to the kind of obligation the actor has to the forum Bovens p notes three different kinds of accountability based on the nature of the power relation which exists between the actor and the forum vertical accountability horizontal accountability and diagonal accountability Consequences are made most tangible when there is a vertical accountability relationship between actor and forum Here the forum formally wields power over the actor p As one may suspect this is the case in many instances of political and legal accountability but also in disciplinary hearings for instance which are a form of professional accountability Cath et al note that governments have key role in creating new policies specifically with regards to artificial intelligence However as Metzinger warns such policy initiatives may end up being co-opted by the industry as has happened to the High Level Expert Group for AI Ethics he argues He warns that ultimately such initiatives may end up as a toothless version of the thing they set out to be It is precisely those teeth which allow the neccessary enforceability in a vertical power relationship What shape could consequences take in vertical accountability Wagner describes cases in which the automated output is subsequently redacted by humans so as to comply with user/legal requests Here he makes a distinction between the first order rules embedded in code and the second order rules which are the manual changes to the output Here the actor is required to revise their course of actions so as to comply with the ruling of the forum On the other end of the spectrum stands horizontal accountability This accountability relation based more on a moral imperative instead of a formal one One way in which such morally informed horizontal accountability is expressed is through self-regulation of organizations According to Saurwein Just and Latzer p such self-organization measures include company principles and standards that reflect the public interest internal quality assessment in relation to certain risks and ombudsman schemes to deal with complaints An example of self-regulation is for instance the Partnership on AI which was founded in by Amazon Facebook Google DeepMind Microsoft and IBM and aims to establish best practices increase algorithmic literacy and to highlight AI applications for socially beneficial purposes While commendable a risk with this kind of initiatives is that they are a form of ethics washing eg or rather virtue-washing As Pasquale and Citron p note self-regulation does not address the organizations first obligation to efficiency rather than public values and human rights see also Saurwein Just and Latzer p also argue that such self-regulation may serve to increase reputation or to avoid reputation loss There is thus a risk that an organization is concerned with the display of good behavior for ulterior motives rather than with responsible behavior itself Much of these risks lie in the nature of the obligation to the forum As the forum cannot enforce accountability little to no consequences can be imposed aside from public outrage Thus one risks entering a slippery slope of non-committal ethics initiatives which cannot be enforced On the other hand other scholars such as Doneda and Almeida p see self-regulation as something that could work effectively provided that organizations and the industry as a whole implement administrative bodies which can safeguard public values As noted above such virtue-washing may be a way out of a vertical accountability arrangement in favor of a horizontal power relation Diagonal accountability is an in-between form of accountability where the forum has no or little formal power over the actor It is quite often found in administrative accountability settings for instance in relation to ombudsmen or auditors p As was mentioned earlier when discussing administrative accountability there is a great call for more such accountability but little practical suggest as to how to design it Accountability risks The literature review identified several accountability risks which we will enumerate below Actor-related accountability risks The problem of many hands Interdisciplinary miscommunication Unfamiliarity with the domain Forum-related accountability risks Problem of many eyes Delegation to systems may impact political accountability Dependencies and power relations between different roles Right to inform legal procedures in black-box systems Insufficient administrative oversight bodies Miscommunication between disciplines Virtue-washing Relationship-related accountability risks Perspective/perspectives not defined Perspectives merging or blurring Deficits and overloads Account-related accountability risks Phases may not be easy to differentiate Which actor should account for what Incompleteness Consequences-related accountability risks Virtue-washing Little means to enforce Some of these are general accountability risks eg problem of many hands In such cases it would do well to turn to accountability theory and learn other domains which have tackled such problems Other risks are medium-specific Both could be avenues of further research within FAT yet they require a different kind of interdisciplinarity INVESTIGATING ALGORITHMIC ACCOUNTABILITY What this systematic literature review demonstrates is that we need to move to an accountability relationship not just of the use the design the implementation or the consequences of algorithmic systems but to consider the entirety of that socio-technical process While the term algorithmic accountability is inherently vague as it leaves a lot room for specification about the accountability relationship it can be specified as follows Algorithmic accountability concerns a networked account for a socio-technical algorithmic system following the various stages of the systems lifecycle In this accountability relationship multiple actors eg decision makers developers users have the obligation to explain and justify their use design and/or decisions of/concerning the system and the subsequent effects of that conduct As different kinds of actors are in play during the life of the system they may be held to account by various types of fora eg internal/external to the organization formal/informal either for particular aspects of the system ie a modular account or for the entirety of the system ie an integral account Such fora must be able to pose questions and pass judgement after which one or several actors may face consequences The relationships between forum/fora and actors departs from a particular perspective on accountability First the algorithmic accountability relationship is networked and accountability is thus dispersed among many different actors It is thus key to concretely specify the actors their role level and the part of the system for which they are responsible Second we see that different fora come into play instead of the traditional singular forum cf However one forum requires a different account than another thus it is necessary to clearly delineate to what fora one caters and what each of these fora needs Third the account itself can be divided into three types of considerations which can also be mapped to the SDLC and the relevant actors ex ante in medias res and ex post considerations This also touches upon the criteria of the account for instance of when to explain/justify what portion of the system Fourth there are consequences which may be imposed on the actor by the forum Here we can distinguish the power relation between the actants and the amount of consequences imposed Fifth and finally it requires active consideration of the perspective on the accountability arrangement which may in some cases overlap Making clear what the main perspective is of the accountability arrangement is thus important as it helps to identify what needs to be accounted for in the algorithmic system While the latter elements of consequences and perspectives are rather general we must not lose sight of their importance else we fall into the trap of virtue-washing or ill-defined expectations about the systems accountability requirements This definition grounded in accountability theory envelops the work that has been done in the past eg and invites future research into the complex and interwoven networked accountability relations surrounding algorithmic systems At its core this definition identifies five elements needed for the accountability arrangement actors forum/fora perspective account and consequences Each of these elements can have a high or low intensity in the accountability relationship The actor is scaled on how well the actor is specified unspecified specified the forum on the intensity of the discussion non-intensive intensive the perspective on its clarity undefined defined the account on its comprehensiveness little much and finally the amount of consequences few many However there is a Goldilocks-effect to the accountability arrangement Too little of an aspect risks a deficit Too much of an aspect risks an overload If we aim to establish an effective accountability arrangement we will have to balance each aspects scale eg making sure the account is comprehensive enough but not overly detailed so that workable accountability is achieved Though a cross-disciplinary systematic literature review is necessarily an abstraction there are two important take-aways that are worth mentioning First accountability theory is sparsely referred to and the field would do well to take note of accountability theory which originates in governance studies Second as this is an issue that affects many disciplines and practices interdisciplinary engagement is a prerequisite Neither law critical data/algorithm studies governance studies data science and the various domains in which these algorithmic systems are applied can tackle these questions alone As algorithmic systems are multiple so should our efforts to hold them accountable be This contribution furthers these goals As this is a cross-sectoral overview further research is needed to ground accountability theory and an interdisciplinary perspective on the algorithmic multiple in the respective domains in which algorithmic accountability is required Moreover a promising avenue of research could be a mapping of the discrepancies between the fields perspectives on the matter A VIGNETTES Below several vignettes are presented which provide some more concrete illustration of the theory and problems described above A Checking repayment arrangements The municipality of Rotterdam has a simple rule-based system which checks whether or not people live up to their repayment arrangement Deviating one cent from the agreed upon installment automatically terminates the arrangement While this is certainly a legal way to implement such as system it may not be the most compassionate Interestingly the municipality of Rotterdam transitioned with the municipal election of from a center-right coalition Leefbaar Rotterdam CDA and D to a coalition which also encompasses left-leaning parties GroenLinks VVD D PvdA CDA and CU-SGP A Automatic anonymization One of the Netherlands four largest municipalities is currently training a system build by a third party to automatically anonymize permits so they can eventually make these available to the public pro-actively The system is part of an effort to minimize spending on personnel which currently manually needs to remove personally identifiable information from the documents At the moment there is still a human agent which monitors and corrects the systems output but the municipality is deliberating to automate the system ie remove the human from the loop when the system reaches accuracy This level of accuracy means that in of all cases the system may have removed too much information from the document and in of instances personally identifiable information may not have been removed thoroughly A Fraud detection A municipality in the east of the Netherlands with approximately inhabitants works together with a third party in a pilot in which they try to detect fraud amongst people who receive social benefits The municipality is quite conscious about the dangers of such algorithmic assessments As such they deliberately place themselves not in the front lines of data-driven developments but rather want to learn from others best practices The municipalitys biggest concern with this system is that they do not know how particular aspects of the system work eg what particular kind of weighting is used for what parameters and thus cannot take full accountability for the system They are very conscious about this problem and thus designed an exploratory space ie the pilot in which they deliberately chose to not let the systems results be a new informational category for the investigatory process but to treat it as any other anonymous tip However the team noted their dissatisfaction with the current setup and are planning to request access and/or insight in the algorithm The investigator noted that they know that the system works but they have no idea why it works They also want to consult other municipalities who work with the same firm to discuss how they tackled this problem Fieldnotes November th Fieldnotes December th A SyRI System Risk Indicator Several municipalities and other public sector organizations in the Netherlands have used the SystemRisk Indicator SyRI SyRI is used to assess which people on social benefits are more likely to commit fraud and considers a vast amount of data from ones water usage to which permits they have requested The system sparked a lot of upheaval in the Netherlands as municipalities started using it as a way to pro-actively screen their citizens eg The system officially reports persons suspecting fraud to the minister in charge of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment The minister delegates this task in turn to civil servants of for instance the respective municipalities using the system in their investigations Nevertheless it is the minister and/or their undersecretary who are/is held accountable in the political forum of the Dutch House of Representatives eg Much details about the system are undisclosed Because of this a group of civil society organisations united under the name Bij Voorbaat Verdacht tr Suspect by default tries to uncover how the system works They have submitted FOI requests which were partially successful and are at the time of writing suing the government for openness about the system Their argument is that SyRI has no place in a democratic environment where civilians are required to share their data with governmental parties which are subsequently connected and used for preventive profiling measures of which the civilian is uninformed and which they cannot question due to the systems opacity The government in their turn argue that exposing the modus operandi of the system may lead to gaming effects thus making such sensitive aspects of the system transparent would be ill-advised B METHODOLOGY B Query design In order to accommodate the diversity of studies relating to the topic of algorithmic accountability relevant associated terms need to be identified This is done using a recursive query design see figure The recursivity lies in the repetition of steps and their subsequent snowball effect First an exploratory query is designed based on the relational strength of the keywords of pre-identified articles Using this exploratory query we then collect new articles and from those relevant we again extract keywords and assess their strength creating a preliminary query This preliminary query leads up to the creation of the final query Some justification is needed with regard to the procedure Author-identified keywords added to academic articles were chosen as an indicator of relatedness Keywords were chosen as indicator as they are created to briefly represent the content of an article and to be specific and legible to ones field of study In mapping the relations between keywords oft-discussed themes should come to the fore as well as the diversity of perspectives and terms between disciplines After the keywords were inventoried they were made more generalizable by using the operator After this colocation of keywords were identified and mapped using network visualisation tool Gephi The keywords which related the strongest to one another informed the new query Figure Representation of the recursive query design process Using the resulting definitive query the corpus was selected This material was selected by screening titles and abstracts for their relevance to the topic and their adherence to the eligibility criteria As computational systems tend to become obsolete quite quickly this study will cover the last ten years up to and including With an eye on future replicability of the study the review will limit itself to those publications published in English Only works that have been published will be reviewed eg working papers will not be included Only articles that present original academic work will be included eg research article review article whereas for instance introductions were excluded B Exploratory query design academic articles which were found to be relevant to the topic prior to the start of the systematic review were assessed for their keywords These articles were all strongly connected to these of algorithmic accountability explainability/transparency ethics decision-making and governance Books reports and academic articles without keywords were excluded from this exploratory inventory As some keywords overlapped partially eg algorithmic decision-making/algorithmic decision making/automated decisions/automated decisions keywords were grouped together when overlap occurred eg decision In total keywords were found after resolving this overlap Next for each keyword of the article relation between the other keywords of the article was mapped This lead to an inventory of relations or edges These edges were subsequently fed into the network visualization program Gephi Among the edges unique ones were found meaning there are instances in which different articles use the same keywords The colocations were visualized using the ForceAtlas algorithm From this exploration those colocated keywords were selected which had the highest degree both in- and out-degree The threshold was set at degree meaning that in order to be considered for the next step in building the query design these colocated keywords had to have a sum of incoming/outgoing connections equal to or greater than fig This left nodes and edges Figure Exploratory mapping of colocations of keywords in articles on algorithmic accountability filtered on degree This selection was subsequently used to build the query The edges table of the filtered subset was exported and duplicate relations were added together The result was ordered on edge weight ie how strong/frequent the colocation is These insights together with the mapping of the colocations allow for a first considered query design Whereas the combined edge weight conveys the strength/frequency of the relation between the terms The network graph gives on indication of the discourses which draw on particular keywords After generating insight in the strength of the relations between the keywords the strongest colocated keywords were selected for the query design To this end edge weights were not included However where further specification of the query was preferable as some terms could be quite general eg big data they were used to supplement the query The query that was designed based in the selection is as follows algorithmic accountability OR algorithm AND accountabl OR algorithm AND accountabl AND transparency OR governance AND algorithm OR algorithm AND transparency OR ethic AND algorithm OR transparency AND decision AND algorithm OR algorithm AND big data AND governance OR algorithm AND big data AND decision OR transparency AND machine learning AND algorithm OR transparency AND explanation AND algorithm OR accountabl AND decision AND algorithm B Designing the final query This initial query was used to gather more relevant publications and to subsequently fine-tune the query design The exploratory query was used to search for more relevant articles and those articles were then again used for a colocation mapping strategy in order to improve the query design In other words the query design is circular so that potential bias emanating from the first batch of articles which were seen as relevant could be nullified and initial assumptions about important keywords could be tested As articles were best suited to this approach as they often include author-specified keywords both Web of Science and SCOPUS were queried Querying titles keywords and abstracts in SCOPUS delivered results in total The search was then further specified for the period results to include only English papers results Web of Science allows for searching a topic which similar to SCOPUS encompasses the title keywords and abstract of a given work Querying topics in the Web of Science resulted in results for the period of which were English As these results needed to be screened manually the smaller corpus of Web Of Science was used for this second exploration and the search results were exported as TSV files After their export the files were cleaned All data entries were screened using the same procedure First the title was checked for its relevance An article is considered relevant if algorithmic accountability is the main topic of the publication If the title was found to be relevant the article was included if not it was excluded In case of doubt the abstract was assessed for its relevance following the same procedure If doubt still remained after reading through the abstract the publication was included provisionary see fig for an overview of the entire process This screening resulted in inclusions provisional inclusions and exclusions Thus of the results were found to be of potential interest The inclusions provided the basis for a second round of colocation mapping Of the papers articles were found to have no keywords leaving articles which did include such keywords in which keywords and colocations were identified Again these relations were investigated using Gephi The network appeared to be connected except for one paper whose keywords did not overlap with any of the other articles This single paper was excluded from consideration for the subsequent query design process It was filtered out by using a Giant Component filter of nodes and of edges visible The remainder of the connections were mapped using ForceAtlas Modularity was exploratively used with different resolutions displayed in fig resolution to see if keyword preferences amongst the various disciplines could be detected but did not produce such results Subsequently the edges table was exported and the weights were combined as described earlier As this second round of enveloped a greater number of relations the cutoff point was not set at but rather at Thus relations with a combined edge weight were included in the final query design Using the combined edge weight a new query was designed As before excluded terms might be used to complement very general terms where necessary The final constructed query is as follows Figure Exploratory mapping of colocations of keywords in articles on algorithmic accountability filtered on degree algorithmic accountability OR algorithm AND ethic OR algorithm AND data AND ethic OR algorithm AND data AND transparency OR algorithm AND data AND accountab OR algorithm AND governance OR algorithm and accountab OR algorithm AND transparency OR algorithm AND technology AND transparency OR algorithm AND technology AND ethic OR algorithm AND technology AND accountab OR algorithm AND privacy AND transparency OR transparency AND accountab AND algorithm OR ethic AND artificial intelligence OR algorithm AND automat AND decision OR algorithm AND machine learning AND transparency OR algorithm AND machine learning AND ethic B Information sources Using the specified query SCOPUS and Web of Science were searched on November th Similarly to the procedure in the query design stage the databases were queried for the period and only publications in English were included Querying Web of Science generated results for the period of which were in English Due to SCOPUS limitation on the downloading of the complete information a maximum of entries at a time the database had to be queried for each additional query separately and sometimes even had to be split per year The separate files were taken together afterwards Querying SCOPUS resulted in hits for the period of which were in English As the query was broken down duplicates had to removed leaving unique titles The titles from Web of Science and the titles from SCOPUS were subsequently manually assessed for their relevance following a similar procedure as per the query design stage ie assessing relevance of the title/title and abstract After this initial round the provisionally included titles were taken together This resulted provisional inclusions from SCOPUS and provisional inclusions from Web of Science After merging both corpora this resulted in titles Subsequently final decisions were made with regards to the provisionally included articles excluded and corpus was limited to journal and proceeding articles eg no book reviews introductions to special issues This resulted in a final selection of articles The articles sources were checked against Bealls list of predatory journals but no predatory outlets were found among the selection To prioritize and group the reading material a rudimentary affinity mapping was done based on the titles and abstracts In the present contribution the articles which were identified as core articles those articles that seemed to related the strongest to the topic were analyzed and presented Of the selected articles were excluded Of these articles were not accessible to the author even after requesting them from the respective authors Seven were excluded because their focus found was not to be on algorithmic accountability upon reading the entire piece were excluded because they were found not to be original research articles eg opinion pieces commentary introductions to special issues Three were excluded as they did not contain results Two were excluded for other reasons This left articles which were thematically analyzed see fig B Limitations and further research As the methodology adopted for this paper is innovative there are some limitations and aspects to it that need further study First of all the methodological merits need to be evaluated and assessed in its own right Second the methodological approach needs to be scrutinized for its potential skewedness or bias It may be possible that the approach though designed to be as inclusive as possible may disfavor particular communities implicitly eg Global North being dominant mode of conversing about this phenomenon thus the recursive query design might disfavor work from the Global South which operates in a different discourse or the initial batch of articles used to distill the exploratory query may have been skewed While we do find several papers with Global South perspectives in the corpus eg this is something that we take in account when evaluating the methodology elsewhere Figure Flowchart of selection process
