The concept of Fairness in the GDPR A linguistic and contextual interpretation There is a growing attention on the notion of fairness in the GDPR in the European legal literature However the principle of fairness in the Data Protection framework is still ambiguous and uncertain as computer science literature and interpretative guidelines reveal This paper looks for a better understanding of the concept of fairness in the data protection Pield through two parallel methodological tools linguistic comparison and contextual interpretation In terms of linguistic comparison the paper analyses all translations of the world fair in the GDPR in the EU official languages as the CJEU suggests in CILFIT Case for the interpretation of the EU law The analysis takes into account also the translation of the notion of fairness in other contiguous Pields eg at Article of the EU Charter of fundamental rights or in the Consumer Pield eg Unfair terms directive or Unfair commercial practice directive In general the notion of fairness is translated with several different nuances in accordance or in discordance with the previous Data protection Directive and with Article of the Charter In some versions different words are used interchangeably it is the case of French Spanish and Portuguese texts in other versions there seems to be a specific rationale for using different terms in different parts of the GDPR it is the case of German and Greek version The analysis reveals three mean semantic notions correctness Italian Swedish Romanian loyalty French Spanish Portuguese and the German version of Treu und Glaube and equitability French Spanish and Portuguese Interestingly these three notions have common roots in the Western legal history the Roman law notion of bona Pide Taking into account both the value of bona Pide in the current European legal contexts and also a contextual interpretation of the role of fairness in the GDPR the preliminary conclusions is that fairness refers to a substantial balancing of interests among data controllers and data subjects The approach of fairness is effect-based what is relevant is not the formal respect of procedures in terms of transparency lawfulness or accountability but the substantial mitigation of unfair imbalances that create situations of vulnerability Building on these reflections the paper analyses how the notion of fairness and imbalance are related to the idea of vulnerability within and beyond the GDPR In sum the article suggests that the best interpretation of the fairness principles in the GDPR taking into account both the notion of procedural fairness and of fair balancing is the mitigation of data subjects vulnerabilities through specific safeguards and measures CONCEPTS Applied computing Law social and behavioral sciences KEYWORDS Fairness Data Protection GDPR Linguistic Comparison Introduction There is a growing attention on the notion of Fairness in the Data Protection framework and in the algorithmic regulation discourse However the principle of fairness in the Data Protection framework is still ambiguous and uncertain as computer science literature and interpretative guidelines reveal The lack of a clear interpretation of fairness concept in the FAT discourse can probably be solved through two parallel methodological tools linguistic comparison and contextual interpretation In terms of linguistic comparison this paper analyses all translations of the world fair in the GDPR in the EU official languages as the European Court of Justice requires for the interpretation of the EU law Section addresses the notion of fairness in the context of the GDPR while section observes how the European Court of Justice addressed the concept of fairness in data protection Then Section analysed Data Protection Authorities understanding of fairness in particular the French and the English one while Section has addressed a linguistic comparison of the term fairness in different European languages The linguistic analysis takes into account also the translation of the notion of fairness in other contiguous fields eg at Article of the EU Charter of fundamental rights or in the Consumer field eg Unfair terms directive or Unfair commercial practice directive In general the notion of fairness is translated with several different nuances in accordance or in discordance with the previous Data protection Directive and with Article of the Charter The analysis in this paper shows that approach of fairness is effect-based what is relevant is not the formal respect of procedures in terms of transparency lawfulness or accountability but the substantial mitigation of unfair imbalances that create situations of vulnerability Fairness in the GDPR The principle of fairness is introduced at article point a of the GDPR as one of the main principles of data processing in conjunction with lawfulness and transparency Potentially the notion of fairness could help prevent unfair imbalances between data subjects and data controllers but the proper meaning of the fairness principle in the GDPR is still unclear and vague History of fairness concept in the Data Protection framework before the GDPR To understand the meaning and usefulness of fairness we need to understand the origins of the fairness principle and its future developments The notion of fairness has always been present in the data protection framework since the very first international documents The very first Council of Europe Resolutions and referred to fair collection of data and unfair discrimination The OECD guidelines on data processing also mentioned lawful and fair data processing of personal data Analogously the Council of Europe Convention at Article stated that personal data undergoing automatic processing shall be a obtained and processed fairly and lawfully Subsequently the Data Protection Directive already adopted the principle of fairness in data protection at Article a personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully and recital any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair to the individuals concerned In all the aforementioned provisions fairness is mentioned in conjunction with lawfulness as two inherently connected principles However in several other provisions fairness is linked to transparency duties Articles and of the Data Protection Directive clarified that in addition to the information about the identity of data controllers and the purposes for data processing the data subject should receive also other information in so far as such further information is necessary having regard to the specific circumstances in which the data are collected to guarantee fair processing in respect of the data subject emphasis added Also Recital confirmed the link between fairness and transparency if the processing of data is to be fair the data subject must be in a position to learn of the existence of a processing operation and where data are collected from him must be given accurate and full information bearing in mind the circumstances of the collection emphasis added The distinction between mere transparency and fairness is probably based on the references to specific circumstances of the data processing at stake If transparency eg at Articles and is mainly based on specific formal procedures to respect in terms of information disclosure fair transparency takes into account substantial interests at stake in a specific data processing and the eventual need to communicate more information to the data subject In other words in the Data Protection Directive while the mere notion of transparency adopts a formalistic-procedural approach the notion of fairness applied to transparency required a substantial effect-based approach what matters is not that data controllers duties are formally respected but that the data subjects in practical circumstances is concretely in a position to learn of the existence and of the details of data processing concerning him or her The principle of fairness in data processing is also mentioned in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights Article and state as follows Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her and the right to have it rectified emphasis added The legislator of the Charter had in mind the principle of fairness of the Data Protection Directive and its interpretation should be linked to the general interpretation of secondary law the directive and now the GDPR Fairness in the GDPR the two nuances ie transparency and lawfulness Compared to the aforementioned legal texts the GDPR is the legal text with the highest number of references to fairness Article a rephrasing Article of the Data Protection Directive mentions fairness as the first principle of personal data processing together with lawfulness and transparency The strong link with lawfulness and transparency is evident the three different principles are mentioned together as three interdependent notions This double link of fairness with lawfulness and transparency is confirmed also at recital which first declares that any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair emphasis added and then affirms that the transparency principle concerns in particular information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing emphasis added The other references to fairness in the GDPR are either related to the link between fairness and lawfulness or to the link between fairness and transparency Fairness as transparency in the GDPR As regards transparency Articles and similar to Articles and of the Data Protection Directive foresee that data controllers in addition to some basic information about data processing identity of the controller contact details purposes etc need to disclose to the data subject some additional information eg storage periods data subjects rights etc necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject emphasis added What makes processing not only transparent but also fairly transparent is that the data subject has an actual knowledge of the data processing concerning him or her and of its main characteristics see recital rephrasing recital of the Directive The link between transparency and fairness is also rapidly confirmed at Article about code of conducts Code of conducts are self-regulatory and voluntary tools required to specify the application of the GDPR such as with regards to fair and transparent processing see also recital of the GDPR Lastly recital also mentions fairness in connection with transparency but under a new perspective in order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed the controller should implement technical and organizational measures appropriate to prevent errors and inaccuracies taking into account potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the data subject such as discrimination eg based on sensitive data Here for the first time fairness is not merely linked to substantial transparency but to the organizational measures for the prevention of any adverse effect to interests and rights of the data subject including discrimination If Articles and reveal only that the notion of fairness should give a substantial approach to transparency duties considering specific circumstances and effective awareness of the data subject recital gives a new additional perspective fairness should be also aimed at preventing significant effects of the algorithmic-driven environment on individuals eg discriminatory biases We will address the idea of fairness as non-discrimination in a specific section below Fairness as lawfulness in the GDPR As regards the link between fairness and lawfulness we need to analyze first Article whose title is lawfulness of processing Article foresees that Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions in relation to data processing for legal obligations Article c or for public tasks Article e In these cases Member States can determine specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX of the GDPR As aforementioned the concept of fairness is often linked to specific circumstances and practical cases specific processing situations In addition the reference to Chapter IX is also noteworthy Chapter IX of the GDPR Arts refers to particular cases of conflicting interests which the protection of personal data could affect freedom of expression and information public access to official documents archiving and research purposes freedom of religious entities to process personal data or sensitive areas in which national legislations could be very different eg national identification number employment law Therefore Article suggests that Member States when adopting measures to ensure lawful and fair processing within legislations permitting data processing on the basis of legal obligations or public tasks should take as an example the balancing provisions at Chapter IX It seems clear that the reference to fairness here should also be understood as fair substantial balancing between conflicting interests A further reference to fairness in the GDPR is recital Data Protection Authorities should exercise their powers impartially fairly and within a reasonable time Here the notion of fair is different from the principle of fairness in data processing at Article Nonetheless comparing the use of the same word in one legal text but in different contexts might be a useful exercise to interpret the real meaning of legal notions The link between fairness and impartiality at recital might be a further element revealing the link between fairness and non-discrimination as we will show infra at Section Possible meanings of fairness in the GDPR After this first overview it seems clear that fairness cannot be reduced to a synonym of transparency or lawfulness but has an independent meaning That specific meaning can have different nuances if it is combined with the transparency principle or with the lawfulness principle The notion of fairness in the GDPR seems to refer to a substantial approach aimed at preventing adverse effects in concrete circumstances situations in particular when conflicting interests need to be balanced However the idea of fairness can have many possible nuances non-discrimination fair balancing procedural fairness bona fide etc Fairness as contextual implementation of transparency and lawfulness procedural fairness As we have observed in Paragraph fairness in the GDPR is always associated either to transparency or to lawfulness In this Section we will analyse how the notion of fairness has been developed even by Article Working Party in these two different fields The three concepts of fairness transparency and lawfulness are mentioned together in Article a and in the following provisions fairness is either associated to transparency or to lawfulness in specific situations circumstances As we show below sometimes even the translation of the world fairness in some EU language overlaps with the translation of the world lawfulness in particular in the EU Charter at Article See in table below the Greek and Swedish translation of the world fairness at Article of the EU Charter Moreover in some EU languages fair is translated in two different ways depending on whether it is associated to lawfulness or to transparency For instance the German version of the GDPR has two different terms for fairness Treu und Glaube is used when fairness is associated to lawfulness and Faire is used when fairness is associated to transparency The first one recalls the notion of good faith while the latter is more related to the proper English concept of fair loyal equitable see infra Also Article Working Party tends to associate the concept of fairness either to lawfulness or to transparency This is clear in two different opinions WP Opinion on Consent and WP Opinion on Transparency As regards the link between fair and lawful WP Opinion on Consent clarifies that the fairness principle imposes an attentive evaluation and communication of the lawful basis for data processing eg sending out the message that data will be processed on the basis of consent while actually some other lawful basis is relied on would be fundamentally unfair to individuals Also basing personal data processing on the consent of data subject does not allow the collection of data which is not necessary in relation to a specified purpose of processing and this would be fundamentally unfair As regards the relation between fair and transparent WP Opinion on Transparency often refers to fairness In particular fair transparency seems to require additional efforts if compared to merely formal transparency since it takes into account also reasonable expectations of data subjects Fairly transparent data processing means expectable and foreseeable data processing even considering the circumstances and context of each situation We can make an example of the difference between formal transparency and fair transparency While Articles e and d states that in principle data controllers should communicate merely the categories of data recipients the fairness principle imposes something more to provide information on the actual named recipients of the personal data and if the controller decides to disclose just the categories of recipients she would be asked to demonstrate why in that case it was fair not to disclose the name of recipients As we show in paragraph X also the European Court of Justice has reaffirmed the notion of procedural fairness as disclosure of personal data recipients in particular in the public sector Similarly the fairness principle imposes the data controller to explicitly mention all third countries to which the data will be transferred According to WP the notion of fairness is also relevant in case of further processing of personal data Indeed the fairness principle imposes that the more intrusive or less expected the new data processing is the earlier the data subjects should be informed in advance In case the data controller processes data for further purposes in compliance with the compatibility test at Article essential requisites of accountability and fairness under the GDPR would impose that data controllers should provide data subjects with further information on the compatibility analysis carried out under Article All these practical examples of fairly transparent and fairly lawful data processing are forms of what Clifford and Ausloos name procedural fairness Fairness as fair balancing based on procedural fairness Analyzing the GDPR provisions Clifford and Ausloos notice that that the notion of fairness combined both to transparency and lawfulness can have two main concurring interpretations fair balancing and procedural fairness Fair balancing is based on proportionality between interests and necessity of purposes while procedural fairness is based on transparency duties timeliness and burden of care of data controllers The notion of fair balancing comes from several provisions in the GDPR As aforementioned Article refers to measures to ensure lawful and fair processing of personal data in specific processing situations such as the cases described at Chapter IX GDPR which regulates complex balancing between conflicting interests eg freedom of expression and information Article public access to official documents Article archiving and research purposes Article freedom of religious entities to process personal data Article The idea of fairness as fair balancing between conflicting interests is also confirmed in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice as we will see in the following Section At the same time the GDPR usually relates the notion of fairness to specific measures Article and recital procedures recital or information duties Arts and recitals and that the data controller needs to adopt That is why Clifford and Ausloos refer to procedural fairness fairness should be practically implemented through specific procedures that can improve the level of transparency and lawfulness of a certain data processing in a specific context Actually the GDPR does not always describe in details such fair procedures the data controller is asked to choose and adopt her own procedures in order to make a data processing fairly transparent and fairly lawful in particular looking at the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed recital and or the specific processing situations Article and In other words the difference between mere transparency or lawfulness and fair transparency or lawfulness is the adoption of additional safeguards that can effectively rebalance the unfair imbalance between the data controller and the subject in specific circumstances For this reason it seems reasonable to affirm that the two components of fairness procedures and balancing are not separate but connected as means to ends procedural fairness tends to fair balance In other words procedural fairness might be an obligation of results rather than an obligation of means the data controller is not asked to merely apply specific measures but to reach a fair substantial balancing between interests in specific situations Actually some scholars argued that fairness at Articles and GDPR is an ex ante assessment on the average data subjects while data subject rights such as right to object and erasure Articles and are based on an ex post idea of fairness tailored on specific circumstances The dualism of fairness as procedural fairness and fair balancing has been recently adopted also in the Council of Europe Modernized Convention On the one hand Article states personal data undergoing processing shall be processed fairly and in a transparent manner emphasis added On the other hand the same article at paragraph affirms data processing shall be proportionate in relation to the legitimate purpose pursued and reflect at all stages of the processing a fair balance between all interests concerned whether public or private and the rights and freedoms at stake emphasis added The relationship between fairness and interests is not new in the legal discourse Bygrave in his interpretations of the Data Protection Directive related the notion of fairness to the consideration of interest and expectations of data subjects As we will show in Section the link between fairness and real interests of the individuals is in line with the western legal history of the notion of fairness/loyalty The Explanatory Memorandum of the CoE Modernized Convention also takes into account a notion of fairness as respect of expectations of data subjects in particular when it connects the idea of fairness to predictability and legal certainty The Explanatory Memorandum also mentions fairness in the balancing with the interests of law enforcement authorities processing data under a necessity and proportionality principle In sum in these first sections we observed how the notion of fairness in the EU Data Protection framework is related to the notion of significant imbalance between companies data controllers and individuals data subjects Fairness in the GDPR is linked both to transparency and to lawfulness the principles of fair transparency and fair lawfulness impose to the data controller adopting specific procedures in order to reach a fair balancing between different interests Fairness as non-discrimination The notion of fairness is also often interpreted as nondiscrimination in particular in the FAT discourse Indeed Oxford English Dictionary defines fair as impartial and just treatment or behaviour without favouritism or discrimination emphasis added The relation between discrimination and unfairness can be found also in the very first international documents on data protection In particular both Resolutions of Council of Europe on the protection of privacy in electronic data banks refer to unfair discrimination While in the Data Protection Directive there is no direct link between fairness and non-discrimination the GDPR seems to refer to the link between fairness and discrimination In particular recital affirms that in order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling implement technical and organizational measures appropriate to prevent potential risks for the interests and rights of the data subject such as discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin political opinion religion or beliefs trade union membership genetic or health status or sexual orientation or that result in measures having such an effect emphasis added Similarly WP in its Opinion on Automated Decision-Making also associates unfairness to discrimination Profiling may be unfair and create discrimination for example by denying people access to employment opportunities credit or insurance or targeting them with excessively risky or costly financial products In particular WP makes also one examples of cases which would not meet the requirements of Article a illustrating how unfair profiling can lead to some consumers being offered less attractive deals than others the case of a data broker selling consumers profiles based on consumers scoring to financial companies for the offer of non-traditional financial services On the other hand Recital links fairness to impartiality a concept close to non-discrimination in particular in the public sector The CNIL the French Data Protection Authority in a recent report on Algorithms and AI has concluded that a fair algorithm should not end up generating replicating or aggravating any form of discrimination The interpretation of fairness as non-discrimination is not common just in the EU framework but eg even to other extra-EU comprehensive Data Protection frameworks In particular the Brazilian General Data Protection Law Dispõe sobre a proteção de dados pessoais e altera a Lei de de abril de Marco Civil da Internet takes largely inspiration from the GDPR Article enlists all data protection principles necessity finality adequacy transparency accountability integrity etc but it does not mention fairness As an alternative it mentions only nondiscrimination IX The Brazilian legislator rather than adopting the general clause of fairness preferred specifying it in the sense of non-discrimination Computer Science literature generally understands algorithmic fairness as non-discrimination For instance Lepri et al recently defined fairness as the lack of discrimination or bias in the algorithmic decisions The European Court of Justice caselaw on fairness in Data Protection law The European Court of Justice has never defined the notion of fairness in data protection law However the Court made several references to the principle of fair data processing The Court has used the notion of fairness in two different contexts fair balance and transparency As regards fair balance the Court has firstly referred to fairness as an interpretative tool for balancing the different interests at stake or the data subjects interests to data protection with the burden which the data protection obligations represent for the data controller or more generally the fundamental right to privacy and the interests requiring free movement of personal data A balancing is fair if it is not based on an invidious choice between two such rights More recently the Court in the Google Spain Case said that a fair balance requires a specific consideration of the substantial circumstances and interests at issue that balance may however depend in specific cases on the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity for the data subjects private life and on the interest of the public in having that information an interest which may vary in particular according to the role played by the data subject in public life On the other hand the Court has also interpreted the notion of fairness in data protection as inherently related to the implementation of the transparency principle in specific circumstances In particular when public administrative body transfers personal data to another public body eg customs authority for the purposes of its subsequent processing they must notify the data subjects about such further processing Clifford and Ausloos conclude that in the reasoning of the Court fairness gives a level of protection to the inherent asymmetric data subject-controller relationships and hence the potential for negative consequence for data subjects stemming from personal data processing even in the absence of a controller intent to deceive The Effects-based approach of ICO and CNIL Fairness as substantial rebalancing of asymmetric relationship Recently the English and the French Data Protection Authorities have elaborated on the notion of fairness in the GDPR In particular the Information Commissioners Office in a report on Big Data AI and data protection has proposed an original interpretation of the fairness principles According to the ICO fairness involves three elements considerations of effects on individuals consideration of expectations of data subjects transparency of data processing While the link between fairness and transparency is clear in the wording of the GDPR the connection between fairness and expectations is more implicit but not new in the legal discourse Article Working Party opinion on Transparency has also associated fairness with the considerations of reasonable expectations of and effects on data subjects The link between fairness and effects is innovative but in line with the aforementioned considerations the GDPR seems to refer to fair processing as based on specific circumstances and situations looking at the substantial balancing between different parties In other words what matters is the effect on the data subject not a mere compliance to procedural duties In a recent report also the French CNIL has proposed a similar approach fairness principle should be interpreted as the prevention of unjust outcomes or impacts In addition according to the CNIL the effects should be assessed not only on the data subject but at a collective level This position is inherently linked to the fair balancing of positions between data controllers and data subjects Taking for example the case of algorithmic platforms the French Conseil dEtat as rephrased by CNIL affirms that fairness consists of ensuring in good faith the search engine optimisation SEO or ranking service without seeking to alter or manipulate it for purposes that are not in the users interest On a more general level in the algorithmic environment fairness could well represent a solution to the problem of unbalanced relations between controllers of algorithms and users In sum this first analysis suggests that fairness is a corrective tool for rebalancing asymmetric or unbalanced relationships ie situations of induced vulnerabilities between controllers and subjects We will come back on these conclusions infra Fairness in linguistic comparison methodological remarks To better understand the notion of fairness in the GDPR a useful method might be the linguistic comparison between different official translations of the GDPR in several other EU official languages The author is well conscious of the difficulties of a linguistic comparison in particular because different translations might have ambiguities or different nuances that might be understood just in that specific linguistic context However the European Court of Justice has affirmed that a correct interpretation of EU law must involve a comparison of the different language versions all equally authentic expressions of EU legislation In addition the Court has clarified that Community law uses terminology which is peculiar to its own context Accordingly legal concepts do not necessarily have the same meaning in EU law and in the law of the various Member States The linguistic comparison cannot be the only tool for understanding the proper notion of fairness in the GDPR such comparison must be accompanied by systemic contextual and teleological interpretation as the one presented at Section How other EU Languages translate the concept of fairness The different translations of the fairness principle in the GDPR reveal different nuances and perspectives For this comparison as shown in table we have analyzed some of the most relevant official translations of the GDPR considering different linguistic families German Dutch French Spanish Portuguese Italian Romanian Greek Polish Swedish and Slovenian The provisions taken into account are not only the GDPR articles and recitals mentioning the concept of fairness but also Article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights that mentions the concept of fairness as part of the fundamental right to data protection Figure Linguistic comparison about the concept of Fairness Before analyzing specific national translations we can preliminary observe that the term fair in the majority of other European languages is translated in at least two or three The author chose these languages which are among the most representative ones of the European linguistic families because he different words referring to slightly different concepts/nuances In addition several translations have similar etymologies eg Spanish and Portuguese versions Italian and Romanian versions etc In the German version of the GDPR fairness is translated as nach Treu un Glaube Articles and recitals and and faire Articles and recitals and There is even a third different word for fair at recital gerecht although we are aware of the different context of that recital where fairness refers to the activity of the DPAs not to the data processing itself Article of the EU Charter also uses Treu und Glaube to refer to fair processing of personal data The two main words used are not properly synonyms On the one hand treu und Glaube is a legal milestone in the German legal history and refers to the roman concept of bona fide On the other hand faire is semantically much more in line with the English fair The use of the two different words is not random Faire is used only in conjunction with transparency faire und transparente ie at Articles and on information duties or at Article on code of conducts for fair and transparent data processing recitals and where fairness is also in conjunction with the transparency principle On the other hand Treu und Glaube is used for translating the fairness principle when it is linked to the notion of lawfulness rechtmäßig und nach Treu und Glauben it is the case of Article and Article Gerecht recital is also a direct translation of the English fair but under the perspective of impartiality and justice and so more in line with the translation of impartially and fairly at recital In the Dutch version of the GDPR just one single word translates the English fair behoorlijk This term referring to a notion of decency goodness and of course fairness is used both in conjunction with transparency and with lawfulness However Article of the EU Charter uses a different expression eerlijk whose nuance is closer to the notion of honest plain The Dutch version of the Data Protection Directive also referred only to eerlijk Similarly that term is used often in the negative form oneerlijke also in the Consumer protection framework The terms behoorlijk is therefore just a recent development in the GDPR Understanding whether this linguistic evolution has led or will lead to a legal evolution is beyond the scope of this research but it reveals the fluid and dynamic nature of the fairness concept in the EU framework The French version of the GDPR uses two different terms to refer to fairness loyale Articles and recitals and equitable Articles and and Analogously the Spanish and Portuguese versions of the GDPR use similar expressions leal and equitativo could profit from different linguistic support from different national experts of those languages There is obviously a similar etymology for loyale and leal on the one hand and equitable and equitativo on the other hand In particular the notion of loyale/leal might be generally translated with the English loyal while equitable/equitativo are well translated with the English equitable In the German version we noticed that the rationale for the distinction between the two terms Treu und Glaube and Faire was based on the different link of the fairness principle with transparency faire and lawfulness Treu und Glaube To the contrary in the French Spanish and Portuguese versions this is not the case where apparently the terms are used interchangeably The French version generally uses loyale while equitable is just used in few provisions at Articles and and recitals and Similarly in the Spanish version leal is generally used for fairness apart from two cases Article and recital mentioning equitativo/a On the contrary the Portuguese translation of fairness is largely based on the word equitativo/equidade with just few but relevant exceptions Articles a and Article use the expression leal in line with the Portuguese version of Article of the EU Charter The two words have similar meanings but while loyalty refers to honesty and constant allegiance to a person or an institution equitability refers to fairness and impartiality but also in strictly legal terms to what is valid in equity as distinct from law The interesting ambiguity of the term equitable referring both to fair and to the legal notion of equity needs to be investigated in more detail In the following section we will analyse the strong link between equitable as expression of equity and Treu und Glaube as expression of the Roman law notion of bona fide Even the Romanian translation of fair has the same etymology of equitable echitabile Interestingly this word is just a recent acquisition of the GDPR both the Data Protection Directive and Article of the EU Charter translated fair with the Romanian word corect leading to the English correct The etymological reference to correctness can be found also in other two linguistic versions Italian and Swedish The Italian translation of the GDPR has just one single world for fairness corretto/a The only exception is recital equo also translatable as equitable Interestingly also the Italian version is different from the wording of the Directive and of Article of the EU Charter Article of the Data Protection Directive translated fair with leale loyal closer to the other aforementioned Romance languages versions loyal/leal and also to the Italian wording in the consumer protection directives The new translation of fair as corretto is a novelty of the Italian version of the GDPR Also the Swedish version refers to fairness at Article a of the GDPR as korrect the principle is korrecthet Surprisingly this term totally overlaps with another data processing principle accuracy at Article d is translated in the same way korrecthet However this apparent ambiguity is clarified in the other provisions of the GDPR where the word fair is always translated with rattvis meaning equitable Actually korrect was used also in the Data Protection Directive but the Swedish translation of Article of the EU Charter had adopted the term lagenligt lawful which recalls the strong semantic link between fairness and lawfulness In Polish and Slovenian versions just one word is used to translate fairness without any ambiguity or recent evolution rzetelnie in Polish and pošteno in Slovenian The Greek version of the GDPR uses two alternative terms for fairness θεμιτή and δίκαιη Apparently the different use of the two terms is not random the first word is used in all Articles referring to fairness while the second word is used in all recitals referring to fairness Since recitals should be meant as interpretative tools while articles as normative sources we should refer to θεμιτή as the official translation of fairness and to δίκαιη as the interpretative nuance to understand its meaning Θεμιτή can be translated as appropriate fair legitimate while δίκαιη to fair trade fair opportunity or punishment Surprisingly the word fairness in the Greek version of the EU Charter Article has a very diverse etymological and semantic source νομίμως meaning legality It is different both from the translation in the Directive article also referred to θεμιτή and in the aforementioned text of the GDPR Similarly to the Swedish case the Greek version of Article of the Charter seems to refer to the notion of legality/lawfulness rather than to fairness as loyalty/equitability Understanding the reasons and the consequences of this linguistic choice is beyond the scope of this research but such differences well prove the semantic complexity and the diverse nuances of the fairness notion in all European languages Fairness as bona fide correttezza and equity in Western legal systems After this overview we can preliminary conclude that the notion of fairness is translated with several different nuances in accordance or in discordance with the previous Directive and with Article of the Charter However three main semantic notions can be identified in all the European official translation of fairness in the GDPR loyal also in the German version Treu und Glaube equitable and correct In some versions different words are used interchangeably in other versions there seems to be a specific rationale for using different terms eg in German when fairness is associated to transparency it is translated by Faire while when it is associated to lawfulness it is translated by Treu und Glaube in Greek all references to fairness in Articles are translated by θεμιτή while all references in recitals by δίκαιη However the notion of loyalty or loyauté equity and correctness have common roots in the Western legal history They all originate from the Roman law notion of bona fide In Roman Law bona fide arose as a reaction to strict and formal application of rules summum ius summa iniuria an alternative to positivist structures The principle of good faith was based on the substantial balancing between the disputing parties rather than on the formal requirements of written law This has been translated into the modern private law systems in different ways An analysis of the principle of good faith in the European private law is beyond the scope of this research Here it is sufficient to understand the legal and semantic link of these concepts across Europe and how the private law discourse on loyalty/equity/correctness might be readapted to the data protection framework The Code Napoléon introduced the principle of bonne foi at Article which states that contractual obligations must be executed in good faith The similar notion of loyalty is not written in the law but is now a consolidated principle in French case law and largely associated to good faith The principle of loyalty is meant as agir à armes égales ie preventing asymmetric relationships between the parties The duty of loyalty in commercial relationships is intended to ensure a balance between the different actors and consists in the obligation to inform the interlocutor and refrain from using reprobated means Such notion of loyalty has been accepted also in the data protection framework The Conseil dEtat has associated the idea of loyalty to the notion of trust disloyal data collection is a damage to data subjects trust confiance In the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch BGB the notion of loyalty and bona fide was introduced at according to which the debtor is obliged to carry out the contractual performance in accordance to what good faith Treu un Glaube requires taking into account the specific trade at issue This provision is similar to Article of the French Civil Code but more tailored on the specific trade at issue thus revealing the substantial and contextual nature of fairness/Treu und Glaube In the Italian Civil Code the notion of good faith can be found both as correttezza Article and as buona fede Art Both these provisions affirm that the parties debtor and creditor or the two contracting parties need to act in good faith the two notions are usually conceived interchangeably as synonyms The Data Protection framework has adopted the word correttezza Even the Italian jurisprudence has interpreted the notion of correttezza and buona fede as aimed at reaching fair balance and proportionality among the parties also seen as an ethical requirement to the parties behavior This notion was originally conceived in accordance with the principle of solidarity one party should take care of the interests of the other party The link between good faith and solidarity has been broadly developed under the Constitutional notion of solidarity Article of the Italian Constitution Accordingly the consolidated notion of correttezza/buona fede in the Italian legal system must be understood as the partys duty to protect also the interests of the counterpart- so to reach a fair balancing giusto equilibrio among opposite interests beyond a mere formal approach to positivist structures In Common Law the principle of good faith is close to the notion of equity In our aforementioned linguistic research the use of the word equitable is often used as a synonym of fair in the non-English versions of the GDPR See in Table the Spanish French Portuguese and Romanian versions of the GDPR As noted equitable means fair but also valid in equity as distinct from law Equity in Common Law has three main functions adapting the law to the facts of individual cases fill gaps in the law and refuse to apply unjust laws Equity is an interpretational tool that can tailor the strict formality of rules to individual cases taking into account possible gaps or cases of unfairness Analogously the Data Protection discourse on fairness is indeed a flexible overarching tool that should inspire the interpretation of existing principles and rules even rebalancing asymmetric relationships Therefore it seems that the historical legal link between bona fide and equity is largely reflected in the different translations of the fairness principle across EU official languages as equitability loyalty and correctness However even the notion of good faith in common law countries and in particular in the UK is acquiring increasing importance in particular under the perspective of rebalancing asymmetric bargaining power between the contracting parties In all these legal traditions the notion of fairness and good faith has been developed mostly in contract law The Draft Common Frame of Reference for European Contract Law DCFR explicitly addresses this notions the expression good faith and fair dealing refers to a standard of conduct characterised by honesty openness and consideration for the interests of the other party to the transaction or relationship in question Article Even the European Commission withdrawn proposal for a Common European Sales law proposed the same definition of good faith and fair dealing of the DCFR Even the Swiss Data Protection Act whose last revision takes inspiration from the GDPR in the data protection principles does not explicitly mention fairness but good faith Treu und Glaube bonne foi and buona fede and proportionality Article Among the three official translations only the German one overlaps with the fairness translation in the GDPR Treu und Glaube Both the French and Italian versions of the Swiss Act refers to good faith bonne foi buona fede while the GDPR versions refers to loyauté and correttezza but we have already argued supra that both the notion of loyauté used in the French version of the GDPR and of correttezza used in the Italian version of the GDPR are generally considered synonyms of good faith in the respective legal systems The Swiss Data Protection Act links fairness as good faith and proportionality although there is no textual link in the GDPR between these two principles several commentators have addressed the inherent link between proportionality and fairness as fair balance as reflected also in the CJEU case-law see supra and in the relationship between Article and in the EU Charter of fundamental right In other EU legal fields the link between fairness and equity or good faith is more explicit In consumer law Unfair Terms Directive defines unfair what is contrary to the requirement of good faith and causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer emphasis added The link between unfairness good faith and significant imbalance in consumer law is in line with the aforementioned reflections about bona fide and fair balance in the national legal histories see interestingly also Department of Justice of State of Victoria A term is unfair if it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations under the contract it is not reasonably necessary to protect a legitimate interest of the trader it would cause detriment to the consumer but also in the data protection law In the field of intellectual property rights the Directive explicitly links fairness to equitability Preliminary conclusions on the notion of fairness in the GDPR We have thus observed that fairness in the GDPR is a complex principle embedding several different nuances and tasks These nuances include the notion of transparency lawfulness non-discrimination but also the concepts of proportionality and balancing Fairness in the GDPR goes beyond mere legality summum ius summa iniuria it is aimed to the consideration of the substantial circumstances at stake This means considering expectations of the individuals effects on the data subjects actual interests of the parties Among possible unfair effects we need to include discrimination but also any other risks to fundamental rights of individuals eg manipulation In particular the inherent link between fairness and good faith as shown in the linguistic comparison even considering the national legal traditions in terms of bona fide and equity seems to suggest that fair should mean prevention of unfairly asymmetric relationships between subjects balancing their substantial interests or their bargaining power In other words fairness is an overarching interpretative principle aimed at preventing situations of unfair imbalance Also the CNIL as already mentioned above see fairness as a solution to the problem of unbalanced relations between controllers of algorithms and users Similarly the Council of Europe Modernized Convention defines fairness as a tool for re-balancing different interests Interestingly Article Working Party refers to imbalance when defining the notion of vulnerable data subjects Imbalance is inherent in most relationship between data subjects and data controllers but we can argue that such imbalance becomes unfair when it is based on the exploitation of individual vulnerabilities from a dominant position In the algorithmic environment such vulnerability might be translated as all cases of eg potential manipulation and indirect discrimination made possible through the great potentialities of predictive analytics and machine learning Accordingly at least one way to articulate fairness might be the protection of individual vulnerabilities and the prevention of vulnerability exploitation as consequences of significant power imbalance between individuals Conclusion This paper has proposed an innovative understanding of the concept of fairness in the data protection field through two methodological tools linguistic comparison and contextual interpretation Section addressed the notion of fairness in the Context of the GDPR while section observed how the European Court of Justices addressed the concept of fairness in data protection Then Section analysed Data Protection Authorities understanding of fairness in particular the French and the English one while Section has addressed a linguistic comparison of the term fairness in different European languages In general the notion of fairness is translated with several different nuances in accordance or in discordance with the previous Data protection Directive and with Article of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights In some versions different words are used interchangeably it is the case of French Spanish and Portuguese texts in other versions there seems to be a specific rationale for using different terms in different parts of the GDPR it is the case of German and Greek version The analysis has revealed three mean semantic notions correctness Italian Swedish Romanian loyalty French Spanish Portuguese and the German version of Treu und Glaube and equitability French Spanish and Portuguese Interestingly these three notions have common roots in the Western legal history the Roman law notion of bona fide Taking into account both the value of bona fide in the current European legal contexts and also a contextual interpretation of the role of fairness in the GDPR the conclusion of this paper is that fairness refers to a substantial balancing of interests among data controllers and data subjects The GDPR approach of fairness is thus effect-based what is relevant is not the formal respect of procedures in terms of transparency lawfulness or accountability but the substantial mitigation of unfair imbalances that create situations of vulnerability
