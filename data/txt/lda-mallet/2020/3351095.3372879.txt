Auditing Radicalization Pathways on YouTube Non-profits as well as the media have hypothesized the existence of a radicalization pipeline on YouTube claiming that users systematically progress towards more extreme content on the platform Yet there is to date no substantial quantitative evidence of this alleged pipeline To close this gap we conduct a large-scale audit of user radicalization on YouTube We analyze videos posted on channels which we broadly classified into four types Media the Alt-lite the Intellectual DarkWeb IDW and the Alt-right According to the aforementioned radicalization hypothesis channels in the IDW and the Alt-lite serve as gateways to fringe far-right ideology here represented by Alt-right channels Processing M comments we show that the three channel types indeed increasingly share the same user base that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content and that a large percentage of users who consume Alt-right content now consumed Alt-lite and IDW content in the past We also probe YouTubes recommendation algorithm looking at more than M video and channel recommendations between May/July We find that Alt-lite content is easily reachable from IDW channels while Alt-right videos are reachable only through channel recommendations Overall we paint a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on YouTube CONCEPTS Human-centered computing Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing KEYWORDS Radicalization hate speech extremism algorithmic auditing INTRODUCTION Video channels that discuss social political and cultural subjects have flourished on YouTube Frequently the videos posted in such channels focus on highly controversial topics such as race gender and religion The users who create and post such videos span a wide spectrum of political orientation from prolific podcast hosts like Joe Rogan to outspoken advocates of white supremacy like Richard Spencer These individuals not only share the same platform but often publicly engage in debates and conversations with each other on the website This way even distant personalities can be linked in chains of pairwise co-appearances For instance Joe Rogan interviewed YouTuber Carl Benjamin who debated with white supremacist Richard Spencer According to Lewis this proximity may create radicalization pathways for audience members and content creators Examples of these journeys are plenty including content creator Roosh Vs trajectory from pick-up artist to Alt-right supporter and Caleb Cains testimony of his YouTube-driven radicalization The claim that there is a radicalization pipeline on YouTube should be considered in the context of decreasing trust in mainstream media and increasing influence of social networks Across the globe individuals are skeptical of traditional media vehicles and growingly consume news and opinion content on social media In this setting recent research has shown that fringe websites eg chan and subreddits eg /r/TheDonald have great influence over which memes and news are shared in large social networks such as Twitter YouTube is extremely popular especially among children and teenagers and if the streaming website is actually radicalizing individuals this could push fringe ideologies like white supremacy further into the mainstream A key issue in dealing with topics like radicalization and hate speech is the lack of agreement over what is hateful or extreme A work-around is to perform analyses based on communities large sets of loosely associated content creators here represented by their YouTube channels For the purpose of this work we consider three communities that have been associated with user radicalization and that differ in the extremity of their content the Intellectual Dark Web IDW the Alt-lite and the Alt-right While users in the IDW discuss controversial subjects like race and IQ without necessarily endorsing extreme views members of the Alt-right sponsor fringe ideas like that of a white ethnostate Somewhere in the middle individuals of the Alt-lite deny to embrace white supremacist ideology although they frequently flirt with concepts associated with it eg the Great Replacement globalist conspiracies Present work In this paper we audit whether users are indeed becoming radicalized on YouTube and whether the recommendation algorithms contribute towards this radicalization We do so by examining three prominent communities the Intellectual Dark Web the Alt-lite and the Alt-right More specifically considering Alt-right content as a proxy for extreme content we ask How have these channels grown on YouTube in the last decade To which extent do users systematically gravitate towards more extreme content Do algorithmic recommendations steer users towards more extreme content We develop a data collection process where we i acquire a large pool of relevant channels from these communities ii collect metadata and comments for each of the videos in the channels iii annotate channels as belonging to several different communities and iv collect YouTube video and channel recommendations We also collect traditional and alternative media channels for additional comparisons We use these as a sanity check to capture the growth of other content on YouTube rather than trying to obtain similar users in other channels These efforts resulted in a dataset with more than M comments in videos of channels and with more than M video and channel recommendations Importantly our recommendations do not account for personalization We analyze this large dataset extensively We look at the growth of the IDW the Alt-lite and the Alt-right throughout the last decade in terms of videos likes and views finding a steep rise in activity and engagement in the communities of interest when compared with the media channels Moreover comments per view seem to be particularly high in more extreme content reaching near to comment for every views in Alt-right channels in Sec We inspect the intersection of commenting users across the communities finding they increasingly share the same user base Analyzing the overlap between the sets of commenting users we find that approximately half of the users who commented on Alt-right channels in also comment on Alt-lite and on IDW channels Sec We also find that the intersection is not only growing due to new users but that there is significant user migration among the communities being studied Users that initially comment only on content from the IDW or the Alt-lite throughout the years consistently start to comment on Alt-right content These users are a significant fraction of the Alt-right commenting user base This effect is much stronger than for the large traditional and alternative media channels we collected Sec Lastly we take a look at the impact of YouTubes recommendation algorithms running simulations on recommendation graphs Our analyses show that particularly through the channel recommender system Alt-lite channels are easily discovered from IDW channels and that Alt-right channels may be reached from the two other communities Sec This is to our best knowledge the first large scale quantitative audit of user radicalization on YouTube We find strong evidence for radicalization among YouTube users and that YouTubes recommender system enables Alt-right channels to be discovered even in a scenario without personalization We discuss our findings and our limitations further in Sec We argue that commenting users are a good enough proxy to measure the user radicalization as more extreme content seems to beget more comments Moreover regardless of the degree of influence of the recommender system in the process of radicalizing users there is significant evidence that users are reaching content sponsoring fringe ideologies from the Alt-lite and the Intellectual Dark Web BACKGROUND Contrarian communities We discuss three of YouTubes prominent communities the Intellectual Dark Web the Alt-lite and the Alt-right We argue that all of them are contrarians in the sense that they often oppose mainstream views or attitudes According to Nagle these communities flourished in the wave of anti-PC culture of the s where social-political movements eg the transgender rights movement the anti-sexual assault movement were portrayed as hysterical and their claims as absurd According to the Anti Defamation League the Alt-Right is a loose segment of the white supremacist movement consisting of individuals who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of politics that embrace racist anti-Semitic and white supremacist ideology The Alt-right skews younger than other far-right groups and has a big online presence particularly on fringe web sites like chan chan and certain corners of Reddit The term Alt-lite was created to differentiate right-wing activists who deny embracing white supremacist ideology Atkison argues that the Unite the Rally in Charlottesville was deeply related to this change as participants of the rally revealed the movements white supremacist leanings and affiliations Alt-right writer and white supremacist Greg Johnson describes the difference between Alt-right and Alt-lite by the origin of its nationalism The Alt-lite is defined by civic nationalism as opposed to racial nationalism which is a defining characteristic of the Alt-right This distinction was also highlighted in Yet it is important to point out that the line between the Alt-right and the Alt-lite is blurry as many Alt-liters are accused of dog-whistling attenuating their real beliefs to appeal to a more general public and to prevent getting banned To address this problem in this paper we take a conservative approach to our labeling naming only the most extreme content creators as Alt-right The Intellectual Dark Web IDW is a term coined by Eric Weinstein to refer to a group of academics and podcast hosts The neologism was popularized in a New York Times opinion article where it is used to describe iconoclastic thinkers academic renegades and media personalities who are having a rolling conversation about all sorts of subjects touching on controversial issues such as abortion biological differences between men and women identity politics religion immigration etc The group described in the NYT piece includes among others Sam Harris Jordan Peterson Ben Shapiro Dave Rubin and Joe Rogan and also mentions a website with an unofficial list of members Members of the so-called IDW have been accused of espousing politically incorrect ideas Moreover a recent report by the Data Society Research Institute has claimed these channels are pathways to radicalization acting as entry points to more radical channels such as those in Alt-right Broadly members of this loosely defined movement see these criticisms as a consequence of discussing controversial subjects and some have explicitly dismissed the report Similarly to what happens between Alt-right and Alt-lite there are also blurry lines between the IDW and the Alt-lite especially for non-core members such as those listed on the aforementioned website To break ties we label borderline cases as Alt-lite Radicalization We consider the definition given by McCauley and Moskalenko Functionally political radicalization is increased preparation for and commitment to intergroup conflict Descriptively radicalization means change in beliefs feelings and behaviors in directions that increasingly justify intergroup violence and demand sacrifice in defense of the in-group and use increased consumption of Alt-right content as a proxy for radicalization This is reasonable since the Alt-rights rhetoric has been invoked by the perpetrators of some recent terrorist attacks eg the Christchurch mosque shooting and since it champions ideas promoting intergroup conflict eg a white ethnostate Our conservative strategy when labeling channels is of particular importance here Alt-right channels are closely related to these ideas while the Alt-lite/IDW are given the benefit of doubt Auditing the web As algorithms play an ever-larger role in our lives it is increasingly important for researchers and society at large to reverse engineer algorithms input-output relationships Previous large scale algorithmic auditing include measuring discrimination on AirBnB personalization on web search and price discrimination on e-commerce web sites We argue this work is an audit in the sense that it measures a troublesome phenomenon user radicalization in a content-sharing social environment heavily influenced by algorithms YouTube Unfortunately it is not possible to obtain the entire history of YouTube recommendation so we must limit the algorithmic analyses to a time slice of a constantly changing black-box Although comments may give us insight into the past it is challenging to tease apart the influence of the algorithm in previous times Another limitation of our auditing is that we do not account for user personalization Despite these flaws we argue that i our analyses provide answers to important questions related with impactful societal processes that are allegedly happening in YouTube regardless of the impact of the recommender system and ii our framework for auditing user radicalization can be replicated through time and expanded to handle personalization Previous research from/on YouTube Previous work by Google sheds light into some of the high-level technicalities of YouTubes recommender system Their latest paper indicates they use embeddings for video searches and video histories as inputs for a dense neural network There also exists a large body of work studying violent hateful or extremist and disturbing content on the platform Much of the existing work focuses on creating detection algorithms for these types of content using features of the comments the commenting users and the videos Sureka et al use a seed-expanding methodology to track extremist user communities which yielded high precision in including relevant users This is somewhat analogous to what we do although we use YouTubes recommender system while they use user friends subscriptions and favorites Ottoni et al perform an in-depth textual analysis of channels broadly defined as Alt-right finding significantly different topics across the two groups OCallegan et al simulate a recommender system with channels tweeted in an extreme right dataset They show that a simple non-negative matrix factorization metadata-based recommender system would cluster extreme right topics together DATA COLLECTION We are interested in three communities on YouTube the IDW the Alt-lite and the Alt-right Identifying such communities and the channels which belong to them is no easy task the membership of channels to these communities is volatile and fuzzy and there is disagreement between how members of these communities view themselves and how they are considered by scholars and the media These particularities make our challengemulti-faceted on one hand we want to study user radicalization and determine for example if users who start watching videos by communities like the IDW eventually go on to consume Alt-right content On the other there is often no clear agreement on who belongs to which community Due to these nuances we devise a careful methodology to a collect a large pool of relevant channels b collect data and the recommendations given by YouTube for these channels c manually labeling these channels according to the communities of interest a For each community we create a pool of channels as follows We refer to channels obtained in the i-th step as Type i channels We choose a set of seed channels Seeds were extracted from the IDW unofficial website Anti Defamation Leagues report on the Alt-lite/the Alt-right and Data Societys report on YouTube Radicalization We pick popular channels that are representative of the community we are interested in Each seed was independently annotated two times and discarded in case there was any disagreement We further detail the annotation process later in this section We choose a set of keywords related to the sub-communities For each keyword we use YouTubes search functionality and consider the first results in English We then add channels that broadly relate in topic to the community in question For example for the Alt-right keywords included both terms associated with their narratives such as The Jewish Question and White Genocide as well as the names or nicknames of famous Alt-righters such as weev and Christopher Cantwell We iteratively search the related and featured channels collected in steps and adding relevant channels as defined in Note that these are two ways channel can link to each other Featured channels may be chosen by YouTube content creators if your friend has a channel and you want to support it you can put it on your Featured Channels tab Related channels are created by YouTubes recommender system We repeat step iteratively collecting another hop of featured/recommended channels

steps The complete list of seeds obtained from and of keywords used in may be found in Appendix A A clear distinction between featured and recommended channels may be found in Appendix B b For each channel we collect the number of subscribers and views and for their videos all the comments and captions Video and channel recommendations were collected separately using custom-made crawlers We collected multiple rounds of recommendations for channel recommendations and for video recommendations Each round consists of collecting all recommended channels on the channel web page and all recommended videos on the video web page To circumvent possible location bias in the data we collected we used VPNs from different locations in the USA in Canada in Switzerland and in Brazil Moreover channels were always visited in random order to prevent any biases from arising from session-based recommendations As we extensively discuss throughout the paper this does not include personalization as we do not log in into any account c Channel labeling was done in multiple steps All channels are either seeds Type or obtained through YouTubes recommendation/search engine Types and Notice that Type channels were assigned labels at the time of their collection For the others we had of the authors annotate them carefully They both had significant experience with the communities being studied and were given the following instructions Carefully inspect each one of the channels in this table taking a look at the most popular videos and watching altogether at least minutes of content from that channel Then you should decide if the channel belongs to the Alt-right the Alt-lite the Intellectual Dark Web IDW or whether you think it doesnt fit any of the communities To get a grasp on who belongs to the IDW read and check out the website with some of the alleged members of the group Yet we ask you to consider the label holistically including channels that have content from these creators and with a similar spirit to also belong in this category To distinguish between the Alt-right and the Alt-lite read and It is important to stress the difference between civic nationalism and racial nationalism in that case Please consider the Alt-right label only to the most extreme content You are encouraged to search on the internet for the name of the content creator to help you make your decision The annotation process lasted for weeks In case they disagreed they had to discuss the cases individually until a conclusion was reached Interannotator agreement was of We ended up with IDW Alt-lite and Alt-right channels Media We also collect popular media channels These were obtained from the mediabiasfactcheckcom For each media source of the categories on the website Left Left-Center Center Right-Center Right we search for its name on YouTube and consider it if there is a match in the first page of results Some of the channels were not considered because they had too many videos and we were not able to retrieve them all which is important because our analyses are temporal In total we collect channels that way We use these media channels as a sanity check to capture general trends among more mainstream YouTube channels We summarize the dataset collected in the Tab Data collection was performed during the of May and the collection of the recommendations between May-July Table Overview of our dataset Channels Video rounds Videos Video Comments Channel Rounds Commenting users Channel b Videos Published M M c Like Count Alt-right Alt-lite Intellectual Dark Web Media M B d View Count M e Comment Count Likes/Video g Views/Video Videos Pub i Comments/Video Comments/View Figure On the top row figures ae for each community and media channels we have the cumulative number of active channels that posted at least one video of videos published of likes views and of comments In the bottom row we have engagement metrics accumulated over time figures g i and and the of videos published zoomed in the range on the y-axis figure Notice that for comments we know only the year when they were published and thus the CDFs granularity is coarser years rather than seconds The raw numbers of views likes videos published and more are shown in Appendix C THE RISE OF CONTRARIANS We present an overview of the channels in the communities of interest and show results about their growth in the last years setting the stage to more in-depth analyses in later sections Tab shows the most viewed YouTubers for each of the communities and for the media channels and Figure shows information on the number of videos published channels created likes views and comments per year as well as several engagement metrics Recent rise in activity Figs ae show the rise in channel creation video publishing likes views and comments in the last decade The four latter are growing exponentially for all the communities of interest and for the media channels Noticeably the rise in the number of active channels is much more recent for the communities of interest than for media channels as shown in Fig a In mid for example out of the of the media channels were active posted their first video while less than of the Alt-lite Alt-right and IDW channels had done so This growth in the communities of interest during may also be noted in Fig i which shows the CDF of number comments per videos and can also be seen between early and late in Figs fg which show the number of likes and views per video respectively Notice that the number of likes and views is obtained during data collection and thus it might be that older videos from those channels became popular later Altogether our data corroborates with the narrative that these communities gained traction in and fortified Donald Trumps campaign during the presidential elections Engagement A key difference between the communities of interest and the media channels is the level of engagement with the videos as portrayed by the number of likes per video comments per video and comments per view shown in Figs i and respectively For all these metrics the communities of interest have more engagement than the media channels Although media channels have more views per video as shown in Figs g these views are less often converted into likes and comments Notably Alt-right channels have since become the ones with the highest number of comments per view with nearly comment per views by Dormant Alt-right Channels Although by approximately the same number of channels of all three communities had become active as it can be seen in Fig a the number of videos they published by the Alt-right was low before This can be seen in the in Fig while media and Alt-lite channels had published nearly of their content the Alt-right had published a bit more than This is not because the most popular channels did not yet exist out of the current top Alt-right channels accumulating approximately M views had already been created by Moreover it is noteworthy that many of the channels now dedicated to Alt-right content have initial videos related to other subjects Take for example the channel The Golden One number in Tab Most of the initial videos in the channel are about working out or video-games with politics related videos becoming increasingly occurring The growth in engagement metrics such as likes per video and comments per video of the Alt-right succeeds that of the IDW and of the Alt-lite resonating with the narrative that the rise of Alt-Lite and IDW channels created fertile grounds for individuals with fringe ideas to prosper Although our data-driven analysis sheds light on existing narratives on the communities of interest it is still impossible to determine from these simple CDFs whether there is a radicalization pipeline To do so in the following two sections we dig deeper into the relationship between these communities looking closely at the users who commented on them M p er Y ea r a Commenting Users Alt-right Alt-lite IDW Media ac ca rd b Self-Similarity c Similarity among Communities Alt-right IDW Alt-right Alt-lite Alt-lite IDW d Similarity with Media O ve rl ap C o C om m en se r Figure In a the number of unique commenting users per year in the top plot and the CDF of comments per user for each one of the communities in the bottom plot In bd we show two similarity metrics Jaccard and Overlap Coefficient for different pairs of sets of commenting users across the years In b these pairs are the sets of users of each community in subsequent years In c these pairs are the sets of users of each one of the communities of interest In d these pairs are the sets of users of the communities compared with the users who commented in media channels USER INTERSECTION We begin our in-depth analysis of users who commented on the channels of interest by analysing the intersection between the users in different channels and communities In that context we use two set similarity metrics the Jaccard Similarity AB AB and the Overlap Coefficient AB min A B Notice that the overlap coefficient is particularly useful to compare communities of different sizes For example a small subset of a large set may yield low Jaccard Similarity but will necessarily yield an Overlap Coefficient of Column a of Fig characterizes commenting users The top plot shows the absolute number of commenting users per year while the bottom one shows the CDF of the number of comments per user per community It is interesting to compare these plots with that of Fig e as we can see that the communities of interest have many more highly active commenters This supports the hypothesis that users who consume content in the communities of interest are more engaged than those who consume the content from the media channels Notice also that although the Alt-right commenters have on average fewer comments than those in Alt-lite or the IDW the community is much younger as discussed in Sec and thus it is hard to tell whether their users are less engaged In columns bd of Fig we consider the intersection between the commenting users of the IDW the Alt-lite the Alt-right and media channels The top figure for each column shows the Jaccard Similarity and the bottom one shows the Overlap Coefficient Column b in Fig shows the similarity measures for a community with itself a year before which here we name self-similarity We find that the retention of users among the three communities is growing with time for both metrics However for media channels we find that the Jaccard similarity is plateauing since and that the overlap coefficient only recently started to grow perhaps due to the sharp increase in commenting users since Commenting users from the communities of interest seem to go back more often than those in media channels Column c in Fig shows the pairwise similarity between the three communities Notably in the Jaccard Similarity between the Alt-lite and the IDW reached almost which is more than the self-similarity between the two communities Moreover the Overlap Coefficient of the Alt-right with the Alt-lite and the IDW is high reaching around in This means around half of the users who commented in Alt-right channels commented in the other communities Lastly column d in Fig shows the similarity of the three communities with the media channels We have that the Jaccard similarity between the IDW and the Alt-lite and the media channels is not so different from the similarity between these communities and the Alt-right This is a subtle finding On one hand it means that individuals in these communities make up a significant portion of the massive media channels we collected which gather billions of views These communities do not exist in a vacuum but are part of the existing online information environment On the other it shows that the Alt-right a group of channels with order of magnitudes fewer views subscribers and comments are actually on par with these large channels Inspecting the Overlap Coefficient however we get a different view there we have that the communities overlap more with themselves than with the media channels particularly since However in there is a sharp growth in the similarity with media channels A hypothesis for this is that as these channels grew more popular as previously discussed in Sec they became more mainstream These analyses take us one step further in understanding the communities being studied We again see that their users are more engaged and notably find that the IDW the Alt-lite and the Alt-right increasingly share the same commenting user base A it e or I D Start Start Exposure Light Mild Severe Start Start A it e I D M ed Figure We show how users migrate towards Alt-right content For users who consumed only videos in the communities indicated by the labels in the rows Alt-lite or IDW Alt-lite IDW and Media we show the chance that they go on to consume Alt-right content We consider three levels of exposure light commented in to Alt-right videos mild to and severe Each column tracks users on a different starting date Initially their exposure rates are as they did not consume any Alt-right content As time passes we show the exposure rates in the y-axis for each of the years in the x-axis Line widths represent confidence intervals USER MIGRATION In the previous section we showed that the commenting user bases among the IDW the Alt-lite and the Alt-right are increasingly similar and the effect is stronger than for media channels This indicates that there is a growing percentage of users consuming extreme Alt-right content on YouTube while also consuming content from other milder communities Alt-lite/IDW Yet it does not per se indicate that there is a radicalization pipeline on the website It could be for example that new users who join the website go on to consume content from all three communities To better address this question we find users who did not comment in Alt-right content in a given year and track their subsequent activity Notice that we do not have the users entire activity history and thus we track their activity only in the channels whose videos we collected For four time brackets we track four sets of users those who only commented on videos of the Alt-lite or the IDW those who did so only for videos on the Alt-lite those who did so only for videos on the IDW and those who commented only on videos of the media channels Then for subsequent years we track the same users Notice that when users are tracked for one year they are not eligible for selection in upcoming years We consider these users to be exposed if they commented on light mild or severe Alt-right videos The results for this analysis are shown in Fig We show the percentage of users we managed to track that were exposed The number of users tracked and exposed at each step may be found in Appendix C Consider for example users who on commented only on IDW or Alt-lite content users as shown in the subplot in the first column and the first row By around were lightly exposed and roughly severely or mildly so which amounts to approximately users in total From the ones who in commented only on Alt-lite or IDW videos users as shown in the last column of the first row approximately of them were exposed more than users altogether We also find that media channels present lower exposure rates as can be seen in the last row of the figure The difference is particularly large for the last three time brackets Less than of users in media channels were mildly or severely exposed against to for Alt-lite or IDW users and roughly were lightly exposed versus approximately for Alt-lite or IDW users When teasing apart users that commented only on Alt-lite or only on IDW content we find that not only users who commented only on IDW get less exposed but increasingly less so The same applies to the media channels For example the exposure rates of users who watched only Alt-lite second row or only IDW third row content are much more similar for those tracked in first column than for those tracked in last column For users who were tracked in around were exposed in both scenarios while for those tracked in this difference grew farther apart Alt-lite vs IDW The previous study suggests that the pipeline effect does exist and that indeed users systematically go from milder communities to the Alt-right However it does not give insight into how expressive the effect is in terms of what part of the Alt-right user base has gone through it We address this question by tracking users exactly as we did before and then analyzing what percentage of exposed A it e or I D Light Exposure Mild Exposure Start Start Start Start Severe Exposure A it e I D M ed Figure We show how expressive the tracked users are in terms of the Alt-right user base Each row shows a different condition for tracking users and each column shows a different level of exposure Each line corresponds to users tracked at a different starting date in the x-axis and the y-axis shows the percentage of the total Alt-right commenting users they went to become notice that all lines begin at because initially they did not consume any Alt-right content users at each year can be traced back to users who initially watched content from other communities In other terms for each year we calculate of the users who are exposed ie who watched Alt-right videos which percentage belongs to each one of the sets of tracked users we just described The results for this analysis are shown in Fig We find that these users are a considerable fraction of the Alt-right commenting audience In for all kinds of exposure roughly of commenting users can be traced back from cohorts of users that commented only on Alt-lite or IDW videos in the past This can be seen in the first row of the plot Moreover we can observe that consistently users who consumed Alt-lite or IDW content in a given year go on to become a significant fraction of the Alt-right user base in the following year This number is much more expressive than the number of users which came from media channels in the last row which never surpasses for any level of exposure Looking at the second and third row of Fig we find a substantial difference between the IDW and the Alt-lite Whereas in Sec we find that the intersection between them both and the Alt-right are similar here we see that users who initially commented only on IDW channels constitute a much less significant percentage of the Alt-right consumer base in upcoming years For all levels of exposure at all times the number of exposed users that can be traced back to commenting exclusively on IDW channels is around times lower So while in of users who were lightly exposed can be traced back to users who commented on Alt-lite channels in previous years only can be traced back to IDW channels Overall in both analyses users who consumed only IDW channel seem to behave more similarly to the users in the media channels Yet as we see in Sec the intersection between the Alt-lite and the IDW is increasing with time which means this population is becoming less significant The experiments performed show that not only the commenting user bases are becoming increasingly similar as shown in Sec but that systematically users who commented only on IDW or Alt-lite content go on to comment on Alt-right channels This phenomenon is significant both in terms of the percentage of the users tracked as in Fig and in terms of the total Alt-right commenting user base as in Fig We present the raw numbers associated with these figures in Appendix D THE RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM In this section we inspect the impact of YouTubes recommendation algorithm Unfortunately we have only a snapshot of the recommender system which does not take into account personalization Thus it is hard to reach significant conclusions on what was the role of the recommender system in the radicalization process we depicted in Sec Yet we argue that analyzing these data is relevant for it is a blueprint of how the influence of the recommender Table Percentage of edges in-between communities in the recommendation graphs normalized per weight Video recommendations are in bold Rows indicate the source of edges

simulation of random walks for channels a and videos b We show two metrics as described in the text the probability of the walker being in a given community at each step solid line and the reachability at each step for a given community dashed line The different columns portray different starting rules for the initial node in the simulations Error bands are confidence intervals system may be measured and because it allows us to understand how the recommender system is behaving for our scenario We perform our analysis in a recommendation graph built using the data collected The graph is built as follows for each channel we join together all recommendations obtained in all rounds of data collection Each channel is a node and edges between nodes indicate recommendations from a channel to another for both video and channel recommendations Notice that in case there was a recommendation towards a channel or a video we are not aware of we add an edge to a special sink node we name Other Each edge is weighted proportionally to the number of times that recommendation appeared in the data collection and weights are normalized so that outgoing edges of each node sum up to The percentage of edges between communities normalized by their weight is shown in Tab for channel and video recommendations For channel recommendations we have that media channels are recommended scarcely by the communities of interest In fact there are more edges flowing out of media channels towards Altlite/IDW channels than the other way around Alt-lite and IDW channels recommend channels from the same community around of the time and recommend each other around Alt-L to IDW and IDW to Alt-L of the time Alt-right channels are only recommended by Alt-lite channels For video recommendations there is a high prevalence of recommendation to videos we were not able to track more than of outgoing edges from all communities pointed towards the Other node We also find that media channels are more often recommended in this setting for all communities while the Alt-lite and the IDW recommend each other roughly of the time Lastly Alt-right videos are not significantly recommended here Given these graphs we experiment with random walks The random walker begins in a random node chosen with chance proportional to the number of subscribers in each channel Then the random walker randomly navigates the graph for steps choosing edges at random with probabilities proportional to their weights We store the random walks and calculate two metrics i the probability of it being in a channel from each of the communities that is the probability that there is a channel of a given community in the k-th step ii the reachability of each of the communities at step That is at step the percentage of times that the random walker has found a node of a given community We run the simulation times for scenarios where the initial node is restricted to one of the three communities or the media channels Importantly we consider a small difference in the experimental set-up for each of the graphs In the channel recommendation graph we allow the random walker to choose the Other node When this happens the walk stops thus at each step there is a probability this walk is interrupted by this or by the fact that there are no recommended channels In the channel recommendation graph as the number of edges to the Other node is too high we do not allow the random walker to go towards it Notice that the scenario for the channels is more realistic and we give more weight to the conclusions drawn there The two aforementioned metrics at each step given different starting conditions are shown in Fig for channel and video recommendations For channel recommendations we have that the reachability of Alt-right channels is of approximately for the simulations starting from Alt-lite for IDW channels Moreover starting from an IDW channel users have approximately of chance of being in an Alt-lite channel at the next step and in steps there is of chance that the user has found at least one Alt-lite channel Starting from the media channels reachability of IDW channels is of and of slightly less than for Alt-lite channels These can be seen on the bottom row of Fig a For video recommendations reaching Alt-right channels from other communities is less likely From the Alt-lite reachability is of around Going from the IDW to the Alt-lite is more difficult the reachability is roughly More relevant though starting from media channels the reachability of IDW and Alt-lite channels is of around and respectively It is worth recalling that this experiment is less realistic than the former as here we ignore the possibility of the random walker being in a video we are not aware of Overall we find that in the channel recommender system it is easy to navigate from the IDW to the Alt-lite and vice-versa and it is possible to find Alt-right channels From the Alt-lite we follow the recommender system times approximately out of each times we will have spotted an Alt-right channel as seen in Fig a In the video recommender system Alt-right channels are less recommended but finding Alt-lite channels from the IDW and IDW channels from the large media channels in the media group is also feasible Considering the sheer amount of views the channels in the Alt-lite the IDW and the Alt-lite these percentages although low may result in a very significant number of views towards fringe content This process may also be amplified when taking personalization into account Notice that we depict the two graphs in which we performed our experiments in Appendix E DISCUSSION We performed a through analysis of three YouTube communities the IDW the Alt-lite and the Alt-right inspecting a large dataset with millions of comments and recommendations from thousands of videos In this section we discuss how the insights of our analyses shed light into our research questions We also talk about the limitations and potential implications of this work How have these channels grown on YouTube in the last decade The three communities studied sky-rocketed in terms of views likes videos published and comments particularly since coinciding with the presidential election of that year as shown in Sec However this seems to be the case not only for these communities but also for the larger channels in the media group A key difference between the communities and media channels lies in the engagement of their users The number of comments per view seems to be particularly high for extreme content Sec and users in all three communities are more assiduous commentators than in the media channels Sec To which extent do users systematically gravitate towards more extreme content We find that the commenting user bases for the three communities are increasingly similar Sec and considering Alt-right channels as a proxy for extreme content that a significant amount of commenting users systematically migrates from commenting exclusively on milder content to commenting on more extreme content Sec We argue that this finding provides significant evidence that there has been and there continues to be user radicalization on YouTube and our analyses of the activity of these communities Sec is consistent with the theory that more extreme content piggybacked on the surge in popularity of IDW and Alt-lite content We show that this migration phenomenon is not only consistent throughout the years but also that it is significant in its absolute quantity Noticeably the findings related to this research question make the implicit assumption that commenting users are a good enough proxy for radicalization and that comments in YouTube channels are supportive of the videos they are associated with We established the validity of these assumptions as follows First the sheer number of comments and high prevalence of comments per views in Alt-right videos suggest that commenting users are a population worth studying especially when in Sec we found that Alt-right channels have a very high percentage of comments per view Secondly during the three week annotation period it was noted that the number of opposing comments is rather small as we found by manually checking randomly selected comments for each community of interest finding that only could be interpreted as criticisms to the videos they were associated with Moreover we note that the proportion of likes for the communities of interest is higher for the communities of interest mean median than for the media channels mean median which suggests the people interacting with the three communities agree with their videos Do algorithmic recommendations steer users towards more extreme content Our simulations suggest that YouTubes recommendation algorithms frequently suggest Alt-lite and IDW content From these two communities it is possible to find Alt-right content from recommended channels but not from recommended videos Noticeably our analysis has several shortcomings which do not allow us to make bold claims about this research question Firstly we are able to look only at a tiny fraction of actual recommendations it could very well be that Alt-right content was being more widely promoted in the past Secondly our analysis does not take into account personalization which could reveal a completely different picture Still even without personalization we were still able to find a path in which users could find extreme content from large media channels Limitations and future work Our work resonates with the narrative that there is a radicalization pipeline Indeed we manage to measure traces of user radicalization using commenting users Although we argue this is strong evidence for the existence of radicalization pathways on YouTube our work provides little insight on why these radicalization pipelines exist Elucidating the causes of radicalization is an important direction to better understand user radicalization and the influence of social media in our lives Moreover in this paper we focused exclusively on basic statistics likes views and comments and on the trajectory of users be they inferred through comments or simulated in the recommendation graphs Another interesting direction would be to trace the evolution of the speech of content creators and commenting users throughout the years to study what are the narratives that arose and how their tone has changed
