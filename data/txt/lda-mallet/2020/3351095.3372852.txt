Effect of Confidence and Explanation on Accuracy and Trust Calibration in AI-Assisted Decision Making Today AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios In these scenarios full automation is often undesirable not only due to the significance of the outcome but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the models to ensure task success We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome A key to their success is to appropriately calibrate human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI specifically we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction Through two human experiments we show that confidence score can help calibrate peoples trust in an AI model but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AIs errors We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI KEYWORDS decision support trust confidence explainable AI INTRODUCTION artificial Intelligence AI technologies especially Machine Learning ML have become ubiquitous and are increasingly used in a wide range of tasks While algorithms can perform impressively in many situations full delegation to ML models is not desired because their probabilistic nature means that there is never a guarantee of correctness for a particular decision Furthermore ML models are only as accurate as the historical data used to train them and this data could suffer from input error unknown laws and biases ML models can assist human decision-makers to produce a joint decision outcome that is hopefully better than what could be produced by either the model or human alone Ultimately however humans would be responsible for the decisions made Therefore ML decision-support applications should be developed not only with the goal of high performance safety and fairness but also allowing the decision-maker to understand the predictions made by the model This is especially important for decision-making in highstakes situations affecting human lives such as medical diagnosis law enforcement and financial investment A key to success in AI-assisted decision making is to form a correct mental model of the models error boundaries That is the decision-makers need to know when to trust or distrust the models recommendations If they mistakenly follow the models recommendations at times when it is likely to err the decision outcome would suffer and catastrophic failures could happen in high-stakes decisions Many have called out the challenges for humans to form a clear mental model of an AI since opaque black-box models are increasingly used Furthermore by exclusively focusing on optimizing model performance developers of AI systems often neglect the system users needs for developing a good mental model of the AIs error boundaries For example frequently updating the AI algorithm may cause confusion to the human decision-maker who may accept or reject the AIs recommendations at a wrong time even if the algorithms overall performance improved To help people develop a mental model of an ML models error boundaries means to correctly calibrate trust on a case-by-case basis We emphasize that this goal is distinct from enhancing trust in AI For example while research repeatedly demonstrates that providing high-performance indicators of an AI system such as showing high accuracy scores could enhance peoples trust and acceptance of the system they may not help people distinguish cases they can trust from those they should not Meanwhile ML is probabilistic and the probability of each single prediction can be indicated by a confidence score In other words the confidence scores relect the chances that the AI is correct Therefore to optimize for the joint decisions in theory people should rely on the AI in cases where it has high confidence and use their own judgment in cases where it has low confidence However in practice we know little about how confidence scores are perceived by people or how they impact human trust and actions in AI-assisted decisions To improve peoples distrust in ML models many considered the importance of transparency by providing explanations for the ML model In particular local explanations that explain the rationale for a single prediction in contrast to global explanations describing the overall logic of the model are recommended to help people judge whether to trust a model on a case-by-case basis For example many local explanation techniques explain a prediction by how each attribute of the case contributes to the models prediction It is possible that in low-certainty cases none of the features stands out to make strong contributions So the explanation may appear ambivalent thus alarming people to distrust the prediction While such a motivation to help people calibrate trust underlies the development of local explanation techniques to the best of our knowledge this assumption has not been empirically tested in the context of AI-assisted decision making In this paper we conduct a case study of AI-assisted decisionmaking and examine the impact of information designs that reveal case-specific model information including confidence score and local explanation on peoples trust in the AI and the decision outcome We explored two types of AI-assisted decision-making scenarios One where the AI gave direct recommendation and the other where the decision-maker had to choose whether to delegate the decision without seeing the AIs prediction the latter of which represents a stricter test of trust We designed the study in a way to have the human decision-makers performing comparably to the AI and also explored a situation where the humans know they had more domain knowledge than the AI In contrast prior works studying AI-assisted decision-making often used setups where humans decision performance was significantly inferior than the models which would by default reward people to rely on the AI While such a setup is appropriate for studying how to enhance trust in AI our focus is to study the calibration of trust for cases where the AI has high or low certainty This paper makes the following contribution We highlight the problem of trust calibration in AI at a prediction specific level which is especially important to the success of AI-assisted decision-making We demonstrate that showing prediction specific confidence information could support trust calibration even in situations where the human has to blindly delegate the decision to the AI However whether trust calibration could translate into improved joint decision outcome may depend on other factors such as whether the human can bring in a unique set of knowledge that complements the AIs errors We consider the concept of error boundary alignment between the human and the AI and its implication for studying different AI-assisted decision making scenarios We show that local prediction specific explanations may not be able to create a perceivable effect for trust calibration even though they were theoretically motivated for such tasks We discuss the limitations of the explanation design we used and future directions for developing explanations that can better support trust calibration RELATED WORK The concept of trust has its roots in relationships between humans relected in many aspects of collaborative behaviors with others such as willingness to depend give information and make purchase Trust has been widely studied in human-computer and human-machine interaction since users decisions to continue using a system or accept output from a machine are highly trust-dependent behaviors Very recently understanding trust in interaction with ML systems has sparked much interest across disciplines driven by the rapidly growing adoption of ML technologies On the one hand trust in ML systems can be seen as a case for trust in algorithmic systems Decades of research on this topic yielded complex insights on humans inclination to trust algorithms and what factors impact the trust For example while some studies found an algorithm aversion where people stop trusting algorithms after seeing mistakes others found the reverse tendency of automation bias with which people overly rely on delegation to algorithms On the other hand ML systems present some unique challenges for fostering trust One is their challenge for scrutablity especially given the increasing usage of black box ML models such as neural networks Another challenge is their inherent uncertainty since a ML system can make mistakes in its prediction based on learned patterns and such uncertainty often cannot be fully captured before deployment using testing methods While many emphasized the requisite of transparency for trusting AI several recent empirical studies found little evidence that the level of transparency has significant impact on peoples willingness to trust a ML system whether by using a directly interpretable model allowing user to inspect the model behavior showing explanation or reducing the number of features presented Many reasons could have contributed to this lack of effect One is the complex mechanism driving trusting behaviors According to theories of trust trusting behaviors such as adopting suggestions are not only driven by a more positive perception of the trustee but also other factors such as ones disposition to trust and situation awareness In fact several studies suggest that overloading users with information about the system could potentially harm peoples situation awareness and lead to worse performance or decision-making outcome Perhaps more critically the premise that transparency or showing information to faithfully relect the models behavior should enhance trust is questionable because enhancing trust for an inferior model is deceiving Instead in this paper we focus on the goal of calibrating trust to help people correctly distinguish situations to trust or distrust an AI While the concept of trust calibration has been studied for automation as to prevent both automation aversion and automation bias it is not well understood in the context of AI systems In one relevant study Dodge et al compared the effect of different explanation methods for calibrating perceived fairness of ML models ie distinguishing between statistically fair and unfair models They found that local explanations by highlighting unfair features used for individual predictions appear to be more alarming than global explanations when used to explain an unfair models decisions and thus more effective in calibrating peoples fairness judgment of ML models different from Dodge et al we explore the effect of local explanation on calibrating trust for different predictions made by the same model instead of calibrating human perception of different models As we discussed calibrating trust for individual predictions is especially important in AI-assisted decision making scenarios We note several recent studies employed similar AI-assisted decisionmaking setups and studied how various model related information impacts trust and decision outcome Multiple studies examined the effect of accuracy information and found people to increase their trust in the model when high accuracy indicators are displayed relected both in subjective reporting and more consistent choices with the models recommendations Closest to ours is the work by Lai and Tan where they studied the effect of showing prediction in contrast to baseline without AI assistance accuracy and multiple types of explanation for AI assisted decision-making in a deception-detection scenario They found that all these features increased peoples trust measured as acceptance of the AIs recommendation as the final decision and also the decision accuracy However a caveat in interpreting the results is that the AI used in this task surpasses human performance by a large margin compared to so any features that manifest the AIs advantage could potentially increase peoples willingness to trust the AI which by default would improve the decision outcome In fact observing the results reported by correct versus incorrect model decisions all these features increased participants willingness to accept the AIs prediction regardless of its correctness which is evidence that they are ineffective in calibrating trust EXPERIMENT EFFECT OF SHOWING AI CONFIDENCE SCORE In the first experiment we tested the following hypotheses with a case study of AI-assisted prediction task Hypothesis Showing AI confidence score improves trust calibration in AI such that people trust the AI more in cases where the AI has higher confidence Hypothesis Showing AI confidence score improves accuracy of AI-assisted predictions is based on the assumption that if holds then humans may be able to adopt the AIs recommendation at the right time and avoid following wrong recommendations In addition we also explored the following research questions Research Question How does showing AIs prediction versus not showing affect trust accuracy of AI-assisted predictions and the effect of confidence score on trust calibration While the former is a common AI-assisted decision-making scenario where the AI gives direct recommendations the latter represents a scenario where the human has to make blind delegation to the AI without seeing its output Blind delegation can happen in realworld scenarios where delegation has to happen beforehand or when the AI decisions have latency We were also interested in it as a stricter test of trust and trust calibration following the setup used in Bansal et al to test mental modeling of error boundaries Research Question How does knowing to have more domain knowledge than the AI affect humans trust accuracy of AI-assisted predictions and the effect of confidence score on trust calibration To achieve these goals we designed a prediction task in which participants could achieve comparable performance to an AI model This task served as the foundation for both the first and the second experiment Experimental Design Participants We recruited participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk for this first experiment participants were women and declined to state their gender participants were between Age and between Age and between Age and and over Age Task and Materials We designed an income prediction task where a participant was asked to predict whether a persons annual income would exceed based on some demographic and job information The data used for the task was the Census Data published as the Adult Data Set in UCI Machine Learning Repository The entire dataset has instances of surveyed persons each described by attributes These peoples annual income recorded as a binary value indicating above/below was used as the ground truth for assessing the participants prediction accuracy ML models are trained based on a sample of the dataset to make recommendations to the participants We selected most important features out of the attributes as determined by the feature importance values of a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model over all the data as features for the models and as profile features shown to the participants in the prediction trials The model was trained based on a random split of the original data set while the prediction trials given to the participants were drawn from the remaining Each prediction trial was shown to the participants with the eight profile attributes in a table like Figure We intended to create a setup close to real-world AI-assisted decision scenarios where the humans have comparable domain knowledge with the AI and are motivated to optimize the decision outcome We took two measures to improve the ecological validity First the decision performance was linked to monetary bonus with a reward of cents if the final prediction was correct and a loss of cents if otherwise in addition to a base pay of Prior research showed that such a reward design is effective in motivating participants to optimize the decision outcome Second since MTurk workers were unlikely familiar with this task we boosted their domain knowledge and performance by a training task detailed in Section and an additional piece of information the third column in Figure showing the chance a person with that attribute-value earning income above on a scale of to This chance number was calculated from the training dataset based on the percentages of people with the corresponding attribute-value earning income above We multiplied the percentages by and rounded the number since prior work shows that people understand frequencies better than probabilities For example in Figure the chance value for occupation indicates that people out of with the occupation of Executive Managerial have annual income above For continuous values like Age and Years of Education chance is calculated over a range Figure A screenshot of a profile table shown in the experiment The table lists eight attribute values and their corresponding chances out of that a person with the same attribute value would have income above eg Age between and The specific range is shown when the participant hovered the mouse pointer on the chance number The chance number can be seen as analogous to learning materials that experts may have in real-world scenarios For example decision-makers often have access to statistics of historical events However these statistics do not obviate the need for human decision making to synthesize various information This is also relected in our task in that the chance values only show probabilities conditioned on single attributes and the participants still had to learn to combine them to form a prediction based on all attributes Design We designed three experimental factors to evaluate the effect of showing confidence scores and as well as to explore the difference in showing prediction and in scenarios where humans have additional knowledge This design yields a total of conditions and we randomly assigned participants to each condition Show vs not show AI confidence Studying the effect of confidence scores on peoples trust in AI and AI-assisted prediction outcomes is the main goal of this experiment confidence is defined as the models predicted probability for the most likely outcome For certain ML models their predicted event probabilities may deviate substantially from the true outcome probabilities this is called poor calibration We checked our models and found that their probabilities matched the outcome probabilities very well Like the chance number we stated confidence probabilities as frequencies in messages like this The models prediction is correct N times out of on individuals similar to this one where N is the rounded number of confidence probability multiplied by Show vs not show AI prediction We compared a scenario where human had access to the AIs prediction to assist their final decision versus one where the human had to choose whether to delegate the task to AI without seeing the prediction The latter was a stricter test of peoples trust and trust calibration In both conditions feedback were provided on whether each trial was correct or not so participants would still experience the AIs performance in conditions where the AIs predictions were not shown Full vs partial model We explored whether it made a difference when people knew they had access to more information than the AI This situation is common in real-world AI-assisted decision making as human experts often possess domain knowledge that is not captured by the data to train the AI For this purpose we trained a second partial model without the most important attribute marital status Note our focus was not to test human trust on an inferior model as the accuracy of the partial model was only slightly less than that of the full model when evaluated on a reserved test set Instead we were interested in the effect of subjectively knowing to have more domain knowledge than the AI on peoples trust and decision-making Therefore for participants assigned to the partial model condition we explicitly told them the model was not considering the martial status attribute and further highlighted the point by distinguishing the marital status attribute in the profile table with a description text extra information for you Since the focus of this research was on calibration of trust for cases where AI prediction was more or less reliable instead of random sampling we opted for stratified sampling of cases across different confidence levels This would increase the number of cases where the AI was less certain about and allow us to better compare the effect of studied features on cases with different certainty levels The confidence scores of the model for a binary prediction ranged from to We divided this range into ive bins each covers a range and randomly sampled trials from each bin for a participant The order of these trials was randomized Procedure Upon accepting the task on Amazon Mechanical Turk participants were brought to our experimental website They were asked to first give their consent then read the instruction about the experiment including the goal of the task and how to read the profile table The instruction was tailored for the condition the participants were assigned to Next they were given training trials to practice In each training trial after participants gave their predictions they were shown the actual income category of that person as well as the AIs prediction so that they could learn from the feedback and assess the AIs accuracy for different cases They were also shown the AIs confidence level if they were assigned to the with-confidence conditions After finishing all training trials participants were told their accuracy and the models accuracy for the last training trials They then proceeded to the task trials where they were asked to make their own prediction first They were then shown the version of AI information with/without confidence with/without prediction depending on which condition they were assigned to Then the participants were asked to choose their own or the models prediction as their final prediction Finally a feedback message was shown about whether the participant and the model were correct In the with-prediction conditions if the participants own prediction agreed with the AIs prediction we automatically took that prediction as the final prediction A -second count down was imposed on each trial before the prediction submission button was enabled encouraging participants to pay more attention in each decision After the task trials participants completed a demographic survey As discussed participants received a base pay of in addition to the performance-based bonus payment plus cents if correct and minus cents if wrong On average each participant received bonus and a total of compensation for completing the half-hour long experiment Results Trust Prior work suggests that subjective self-reported trust may not be a reliable indicator for trusting behaviors which are what ultimately matter in AI-assisted decision tasks Therefore following recent studies we measured participants trust in the AI by two behavioral indicators Switch percentage the percentage of trials in which the participant decided to use the AIs prediction as their final prediction In conditions where the AIs prediction was shown it was the percentage of trials using the AIs prediction among trials where participants and the AI disagreed In conditions where the AIs prediction was not shown it was the percentage of trials in which participants chose to delegate the prediction to the AI among all trials Agreement percentage the percentage of trials in which the participants final prediction agreed with the AIs prediction The main difference between the two measures was that in the with-prediction conditions the agreement percentage would count the trials in which the participants and the AIs predictions agreed and automatically counted as the final decision whereas the switch percentage would only consider cases where they disagreed and had to make an intentional act of switching Therefore we consider switch percentage to be a stricter measure of trust even though agreement percentage was used in prior research Figure shows the switch percentage across the prediction and confidence factors The result that the orange error bars w/ confidence conditions are higher than the green error bars w/o confidence conditions indicates that the participants switched to the AIs predictions or decided to use AI in the without-prediction conditions more often when the AIs confidence scores were displayed A four factor ANOVA confidence prediction model completeness model confidence level confirmed that the main effect of showing confidence scores was significant p The other two factors prediction and model completeness did not have any significant main effect or interaction partially answering and As can be seen in Figure showing prediction did not affect switch percentages significantly p The insignificant effect of model completeness p suggests that participants did not distrust the partial model Given that the two models had similar accuracy participants acted rationally Figure further examines how showing confidence calibrated trust for cases of different confidence levels The figure shows that when the AIs confidence level was between and there was not much difference between with- and without-confidence conditions In fact participants seemed to trust the model less w/o prediction w/ prediction S it c P e rc e n ta g e w/o confidence w/ confidence Figure Switch percentage measured as how often participants chose the AIs predictions as their final predictions across confidence and prediction conditions The dots indicate the mean percentages All error bars in this and subsequent graphs show one standard error when AI confidence was shown and was less than But when the AIs confidence level was high above participants trust was significantly enhanced by seeing the confidence scores This calibration of trust was confirmed by a statistically significant interaction between showing confidence and the AIs confidence level p Further when the AI confidence score was not shown participants trust was generally maintained around the same level across trials of all confidence levels This was confirmed by an ANOVA on the without-confidence conditions main effect of confidence level was not significant p To answer the trust calibration effect by showing confidence score held regardless of whether the model prediction was shown In other words high confidence scores encouraged participants to delegate the decision task to the AI even without seeing its predictions This was confirmed by the insignificant three-way interaction between confidence prediction and confidence level p A similar pattern was observed in the other trust measure agreement percentage as shown in Figure When the confidence score was shown the difference in the agreement percentage between high-confidence levels and low-confidence levels became more pronounced The calibration effect of confidence score on the agreement percentage as indicated by the interaction between confidence and confidence levels was significant p Similarly this calibration effect held in scenarios of showing and not showing AI prediction p was thus fully supported Accuracy During the experiment we collected three types of predictions a participants own predictions before they saw any information from the AI b the AIs predictions and c the participants final prediction after seeing AI information which we call AI-assisted prediction We measured the accuracy for each type of prediction On average the participants own accuracy was with only of participants under while the AI accuracy was note this number is lower than model accuracy on test data because of stratified sampling for experiment trials These accuracy p re d n p re d n AI confidence level S it c P e rc e n ta g e w/o confidence w/ confidence Figure Switch percentage across ive confidence levels and various conditions p re d n p re d n AI confidence level A g re e m e n t P e rc e n ta g e w/o confidence w/ confidence Figure Agreement percentage measured as how often participants agree with the models prediction across confidence levels and various conditions numbers did not show statistically significant variations across experimental conditions Thus in our task AI had an advantage over the humans but not by much This is in contrast to where the humans performed substantially worse than the AI by After confirming that displaying confidence both improved overall trust and helped calibrate trust with confidence levels we investigated whether this translated to improvement in the accuracy of the AI-assisted predictions Figure shows this AI-assisted accuracy w/o prediction w/ prediction A I A s s is te d P re d ti o n A c c u ra c y model with all variables model w/o marital status w/o confidence w/ confidence Figure Accuracy of the human and AI-assisted predictions across conditions across conditions It suggests that there was no significant difference in AI-assisted accuracy across the prediction and confidence conditions Indeed an ANOVA showed that only the AI confidence level p and its interaction with model completeness p had significant effect Furthermore we also analyzed the difference between AI-assisted accuracy and AI accuracy and none of the factors showed significant effects We originally expected that the AI-assisted prediction ie human-AI joint decision would be more accurate than the AI alone when the AI confidence was low but that did not turn out to be true The fact that showing confidence improved trust and trust calibration but failed to improve the AI-assisted accuracy is puzzling and it rejects our This phenomenon could be explained by the correlation between model decision uncertainty and human decision uncertainty because trials where the model prediction had low confidence were also more challenging for humans This can be seen in Figure that the humans were less accurate than AI across all confidence levels although the difference is smaller in the low confidence trials Therefore even though showing confidence encouraged participants to trust the AI more in high-confidence zone the number of trials in which the human and the AI disagreed in these cases were low to begin with while in the low-confidence zone humans predictions were not better substitutes for AIs A caveat to interpret the results here is that if the correlation between human and model uncertainty decreases for example if the human expert and the model each has a unique set of knowledge it is possible that better calibration of trust with the model certainty could lead to improved AI-assisted decisions In summary results of Experiment showed that displaying confidence score improved trust calibration supported and increased peoples willingness to rely on AIs prediction in high-confidence cases This trust calibration effect held in AI-assisted decision scenarios where the AIs recommendation was shown and in scenarios where people had to make blind delegation without AI confidence level D if fe re n c e b e tw e e n u m a n a n d A I A c c u ra c y Figure difference between human and AI accuracy across confidence levels seeing the AIs recommendation However in this case study trust calibration did not translate into improvement in AI-assisted decision outcome rejected potentially because there was not enough complementary knowledge for people to draw on While we explored a scenario where participants knew they had additional knowledge that the AI did not have access to it did not make significant difference in the AI-assisted prediction task EXPERIMENT EFFECT OF LOCAL EXPLANATION The second experiment examined the effect of local explanations It had the same setup as Experiment but instead of showing confidence scores we showed local explanations for each AI prediction The main hypothesis we wanted to test was that because local explanation is suggested to help people judge whether to trust a particular prediction and it could potentially expose uncertainty underlying an AI prediction showing explanation could support trust calibration and improve AI-assisted predictions Experiment Setup We developed a visual explanation feature like the one in Figure This visualization explains a particular model prediction by how each attribute contributes to the models prediction The contribution values were generated using a state-of-the-art local explanation technique called Shapley method Experiment was carried out only under the full-model with prediction condition We only tested the full-model condition because the first experiment did not show significant effect of the model completeness We only tested the with-prediction condition because even if the prediction was not shown participants could still derive them from the explanation graphs if the sum of the orange bars is longer than the sum of the blue bars the model predicts income above and vice versa Nine participants were recruited for Experiment Four of them were women One participant was between Age four between Age and two between and and two above Results The goal of Experiment was to test the effect of local explanation on peoples trust in the AI and the AI-assisted decision outcomes Figure A screenshot of the explanation shown for a particular trial Participants were told that orange bars indicate that the corresponding attributes suggest higher likelihood of income above whereas blue bars indicate higher likelihood of income below The light blue bar at the bottom indicates the base chance a person with average values in all attributes is unlikely to have income above as compared to baseline condition and the effect of confidence scores Therefore for the subsequent analysis we combined the data collected from this experiment with those from the baseline and with-confidence condition of Experiment all conditions are full-model with-prediction Trust Figure shows that unlike confidence explanation did not seem to affect participants trust in the model predictions across confidence levels As discussed before indicated by the orange bars showing model confidence encouraged participants to trust the model more in high-confidence cases note that the statistics are not identical to those in Figure because results here only included data in the full-model with-prediction condition but the results for explanation blue error bars did not show such a pattern Instead the switch percentage seemed to stay constant across confidence levels similar to that in the control condition Results of an ANOVA supported these observations the model information factor no info vs confidence vs explanation had a significant effect on the switch percentage p and its interaction with model confidence level was also significant p A Tukeys honestly significant difference HSD post-hoc test showed that the switch percentage in the confidence condition was significantly higher than those in the baseline condition p and the explanation condition p but the explanation condition was not significantly different from the baseline p The agreement percentage showed a similar effect albeit less pronounced As shown in Figure the baseline condition green and the explanation condition blue had similar agreement percentages while the with-confidence condition orange had higher percentage when the confidence level was above Nonetheless this effect was not significant on this measure p Taken together was rejected as we found no evidence that showing explanation was more effective in trust calibration than the baseline Accuracy In Experiment the average Human accuracy was while the AIs accuracy was again due to stratified sampling Figure examines the effect of explanation on the accuracy of AI-assisted predictions Similar to Experiment we did not find any significant difference in AI-assisted accuracy across model AI confidence level S it c P e rc e n ta g e no info confidence explanation Figure Switch percentage across confidence levels and model information conditions AI confidence level A g re e m e n t P e rc e n ta g e no info confidence explanation Figure Agreement percentage across confidence levels and model information conditions information conditions p If anything there was a reverse trend of decreasing the AI-assisted accuracy by showing explanation was thus also rejected Taken together the results suggest a lack of effect of local explanations on improving trust calibration and AI-assisted prediction Our results appeared to contradict conclusions in Lai and Tans study which showed that explanations could improve peoples trust and the joint decision outcome But a closer look at Lai and Tans results revealed a trend of indiscriminatory increase in trust willingness to accept whether the AI made correct or incorrect predictions suggesting similar conclusion that explanations are ineffective for trust calibration However since in their study the AI outperformed human by a large margin this indiscriminatory increase in trust improved the overall decision outcome It is no info confidence explanation A I A s s is te d P re d ti o n A c c u ra c y no info confidence explanation Figure Accuracy of the AI-assisted predictions across conditions also possible in that setup explanations could display the superior capability of the system and more effectively enhance the trust In the next section we discuss the implications of differences in the AI-assisted decision task setups and the limitations of local explanations for trust calibration DISCUSSIONS We discuss broader implications of this case study for improving AI-assisted decision-making Mental Model of Error Boundaries Consistent with prior work on trust calibration for automation we show that case specific confidence information can improve trust calibration in AI-assisted decision making scenarios In these scenarios showing confidence is potentially more helpful than showing model-wide information such as accuracy Bansal et al mentioned that well-calibrated confidence scores can potentially help people form a good mental model of AIs error boundaries understanding of when the AI is likely to err We recognize that we did not measure peoples mental model directly but instead focusing on behavioral manifestation of trust calibration Developing a good mental model is indeed a higher target which requires one to construct explicit representation of error boundaries With a good mental model one may be able to more efficiently calibrate trust without the needs to access and comprehend confidence information for every prediction A recent paper by Hofman et al recognizes that forming a good mental model of AI is the key to effectively appropriating trust and usage The paper also calls out the need to develop methods to measure the soundness of users mental model and suggests references from methods in cognitive psychology Using these methods future work could examine whether having access to confidence information could effectively foster a mental model of error boundaries However showing confidence scores has its drawbacks It is well understood that confidence scores are not always well calibrated in ML classifiers Also a numeric score may not be interpreted meaningfully by all people especially in complex tasks Moreover confidence scores alone may be insufficient to foster a good mental model since it would require people to extract explicit knowledge from repeated experience Future work could explore techniques to provide more explicit description of error boundaries or low-confidence zones and study their effect on trust calibration and AI-assisted decision making Alignment of Humans and AIs Error Boundaries Our study found little effect of confidence information on improving AI-assisted decision outcome even though it improved trust calibration A potential reason is that in our setup the error boundaries of humans and AIs were largely aligned In other words in situations where the AI was likely to err the humans were also likely to err Participants recruited from Mechanical Turk are not experts in an income prediction task We attempted to inject domain knowledge by providing participants with chance numbers for each feature while the model was trained on the same data with the same set of features While we explored conditions where the human had access to an additional key attribute it might not have created sufficient advantage for the human We envision in situations where the AI and the human have complementary error boundaries trust calibration may be more effective in improving AI-assisted decision outcomes Future work should test this hypothesis Results of our study show some discrepancies with prior works especially Lai and Tans study We recognize the differences between the setups While in our study the human and AI had largely aligned knowledge and performance in the humans had significantly worse performance in the deception detection task We may consider the setup in to be a situation where the human and the AI not only have unaligned but also unequal error zones These comparisons highlight the problem of generalizability from studies of AI-assisted decision making tasks without explicitly characterizing or controlling for the humans performance profile and its difference from the AIs Our results suggest that such characterization or experimental control may need to go beyond the overall performance but also consider the alignment of error boundaries between the human and the AI While how to characterize the level of error boundary alignment poses an open question we invite the research community to consider it in order to collectively produce unified theories and best practices of AI-assisted decision making Explainability for Trust Calibration Explainable artificial Intelligence is a rapidly growing research discipline The quest for explainability has its roots in the growing adoption of high-performance black-box AI models which spurs public concerns about the safety and ethical usage of AI Given such AI aversion research has largely embraced explainability as a potential cure for enhancing trust and usage of AI Empirical studies of human-AI interaction also tend to seek validation of trust enhancement by explainability albeit with highly mixed results But in practice there are diverse needs for explainability as captured by including scenarios for ensuring safety in complex tasks guarding against discrimination and improving user control of AI In many of these scenarios one would desire support for effectively and efficiently identifying errors uncertainty and mismatched objectives of AI instead of being persuaded to Figure Screenshots of explanation for cases where the model had low confidence over-trust the system Therefore we highlight the problem of trust calibration and designed a case study to explore whether a popular local explanation method could support trust calibration Unfortunately we did not find the explanation to create perceivable effect in calibrating trust in AI predictions This stands in contrast to the findings of where explanations helped expose a critical law in the model treating snow as Husky which could help the debugging work We note the difference in our setup the classification model may not have obvious laws in its overall logic and trust calibration may require more than recognizing laws in the explanation Figure lists two examples of explanation shown for a low-confidence prediction In theory prediction confidence could be inferred by summing the positive and negative contributions of all attributes If the sum is close to zero then the prediction is not made with confidence However we speculate that this method of inference might not have been obvious for people without ML training Instead one may simply focus on whether the top features and their contributions are sensible In these two examples marital status is considered as the main reason for the model to predict higher income This is a sensible rationale that would frequently appear in explanations regardless of prediction confidence It is also possible that the explanation created information overload or are simply ignored by some participants We acknowledge that some of these problems may be specific to the visual design we adopted It is also possible that the underlying explanation algorithm has its limitation in faithfully reflecting prediction certainty Nonetheless our study highlights the importance of studying how an AI explanation design is perceived by a particular group of users for a particular goal There are many other explanation methods and techniques and it is possible that some are more effective in calibrating trust or exposing model problems For example Dodge et al compared the effect of different explanation methods in exposing discrimination of an unfair model The study showed that sensitivity based explanation which highlights only a small number of features that if changed could lip the models prediction is perceived as more alarming and therefore more effective at calibrating fairness judgment than methods that list the contribution of every feature A study conducted by Cai et al found that comparative explanation by comparisons with examples in alternative classes can lead to better discovery of the limitations of the AI compared to normative explanation that describes examples in the intended class Although these results imply that some explanation methods may better serve the goal of trust calibration we know little about the mechanism neither from the algorithmic side on what makes an explanation technique sensitive to the trustworthiness of a model or prediction nor from the human perception side on what characteristics of explanations are associated with trust or distrust We therefore invite the research community to explore AI explainability specifically for trust calibration both at the model level and the prediction level As a starting point explanation methods and techniques could target a different set of goals in addition to metrics suggested in the current literature such as faithfulness improved human understanding or acceptance For example explanation that could effectively support trust calibration at the model level should be sensitive to the model performance while explanation that support trust calibration at the prediction level should be sensitive to the prediction uncertainty Ultimately trust resides in human perception and the effect on trust calibration should be evaluated by having targeted users in the loop Our study provides an example of how to conduct such an evaluation for trust calibration LIMITATIONS One limitation of our study is that our participants are not experts in income prediction This problem was mitigated by the training task and the access to statistics of the domain the chance column The fact that participants accuracy was only less than the model trained on a large dataset suggests that these domain-knowledge enhancement measures were effective Although it is desirable to conduct the experiment with real experts it can be extremely expensive Our approach can be considered as human grounded evaluation a valid approach by using lay people as proxy to understand the general behavioral patterns Another limitation is that we use a contrived prediction task where the participants would not be held responsible We mitigated the problem by introducing an outcome based bonus reward which prior studies suggest could effectively motivate optimizing the decision-making While future study could experiment with scenarios with more significant real-world impact we note that they have to be executed with caution to avoid ethical concerns Lastly the method that we proposed for calibrating trust showing model prediction confidence to the decisionmaker clearly depends on the models predicted probabilities being well calibrated to the true outcome probabilities There are certain machine learning models that do not meet this criterion such as SVM though this issue can be potentially addressed through Platt Scaling or Isotonic Regression
