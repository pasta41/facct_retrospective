Access to Population-Level Signaling as a Source of Inequality We identify and explore differential access to population-level signaling also known as information design as a source of unequal access to opportunity A population-level signaler has potentially noisy observations of a binary type for each member of a population and based on this produces a signal about each member A decision-maker infers types from signals and accepts those individuals whose type is high in expectation We assume the signaler of the disadvantaged population reveals her observations to the decision-maker whereas the signaler of the advantaged population forms signals strategically We study the expected utility of the populations as measured by the fraction of accepted members as well as the false positive rates FPR and false negative rates FNR We first show the intuitive results that for a fixed environment the advantaged population has higher expected utility higher FPR and lower FNR than the disadvantaged one despite having identical population quality and that more accurate observations improve the expected utility of the advantaged population while harming that of the disadvantaged one We next explore the introduction of a publicly-observable signal such as a test score as a potential intervention Our main finding is that this natural intervention intended to reduce the inequality between the populations utilities may actually exacerbate it in settings where observations and test scores are noisy CONCEPTS Theory of computation Algorithmic game theory KEYWORDS Fairness strategic signaling information design university admissions INTRODUCTION Settings where personal data drive consequential decisions at large scale abound financial data determine loan decisions personal history affects bail and sentencing academic records feed into admissions and hiring Data-driven decision-making is not reserved for major life events of course on a minute-by-minute basis our digital trails are used to determine the news we see the job ads we are shown and the behaviors we are nudged towards There has been an explosion of interest recently in the ways in which such data-driven decision-making can reinforce and amplify injustices One goal of the literature has been to identify the points in the decision-making pipeline that can contribute to unfairness For example are data more noisy or less plentiful for a disadvantaged population than for an advantaged one Are the available data less relevant to the decision-making task with respect to the disadvantaged population Has the disadvantaged population historically been prevented or discouraged from acquiring good data profiles that would lead to favorable decisions Is the decision-maker simply making worse decisions about the disadvantaged population despite access to data that could prevent it In this paper we study access to population-level signaling as a source of inequity that to our knowledge has not received attention in the literature We consider settings where the data of individuals in a population passes to a population-level signaler and the signaler determines what function of the data is provided as a signal to a decision-maker The signaler can serve as an advocate for the population by filtering or noising its individuals data but cannot outright lie to the decision-maker whatever function the signaler chooses to map from individuals data to signals must be fixed and known to the decision-maker Examples of population-level strategic signalers include high schools who in order to increase the chances that their students will be admitted to prestigious universities inflate their grades refuse to release class rankings and provide glowing recommendation letters for more than just the best students Likewise law firms advocate on behalf of their client populations by selectively revealing information or advocating for trial vs plea bargains Even the choice of advertisements we see online is based on signals about us sold by exchanges who wish to make their ad-viewing population seem as valuable as possible Our interest in asymmetric information in general and in population level strategic signaling in particular are inspired by the recent wave of interest in these issues in the economics literature see Section for an overview In particular the model we adopt to study these issues in the context of inequity parallels the highly influential work on Bayesian persuasion and information design In order to explore the role that population-level strategic signaling can play in reinforcing inequity we investigate its impact in a stylized model of university admissions We consider a setting in which a high schools information about its students is noisy but unbiased Throughout we call this noisy information grades but emphasize that it may incorporate additional sources of information such as observations of personality and effort that are also indicative of student quality Importantly all relevant information about student quality is observed directly by the school alone The school then aggregates each students information into a signal about that student that is transmitted to the university This aggregation method is called a signaling scheme or informally a randomized mapping from a students information to a recommendation A school could for instance choose to give the same recommendation for all its students effectively aggregating the information about all students into one statement about average quality Or for example the school could choose to provide positive recommendations to only those students that it believes based on its information to have high ability The university makes admission decisions based on these recommendations with the goal of admitting qualified students and rejecting unqualified ones designed to maximize the number of their students admitted by the university We call such a school strategic Alternatively a school might simply report the information it has collected on its students to the university directly We call such a school revealing As is common in economics we assume that the university knows the signaling scheme chosen by the school but does not know the realization of any randomness the school uses in its mapping One justification typically given for such an assumption is that the university could learn this mapping over time as it observes student quality from past years As expected we find that strategic schools with accurate information about their students have a significant advantage over revealing schools and in the absence of intervention strategic schools get more of their students including unqualified ones admitted by the university A common intervention in this setting is the standardized test The university could require students to take a standardized test before being considered for admission and use test scores in addition to the schools recommendations in an effort to enable more-informed admissions decisions Intuitively the role of the standardized test is that it adds information back in that was obfuscated by a strategic school in its recommendations and so one might naturally expect the test to reduce inequity in the admissions process While such a standardized test does increase the accuracy of admissions decisions we show that when the test is a noisy estimate of student quality it may in fact exacerbate the impact of disparities in signaling between schools Summary of contributions We highlight access to strategic population level signaling as studied in the economics literature as a potential source of inequity We derive the optimal signaling scheme for a school in Section and compute the resulting school utility and false positive and negative rates in Section We then show in Section that disparities in abilities to signal strategically can constitute a non-negligible source of inequity In Section complementarities between students we study the effect of a standardized test that students must take before applying to the university and highlight its limitations in addressing signaling-based inequity RELATED WORK There is a large literature on individual-level signaling in economics following on the Nobel-prize-winning work of Spence The general model there is quite different from our population-level signaling model in the Spence model individuals not populations invest in costly in terms of money or effort signals whose costs correlate with the individuals type In that model equilibria can emerge where high-type individuals are more likely to invest in the signal than low-types which can result in the signal being useful for admissions or hiring Closer to our setting Ostrovsky and Schwarz study a model in which schools provide noisy information about their students to potential employers Their focus is on understanding properties of the equilibria of the system they do not fully characterize the equilibria they do not consider the role of signaling in compounding inequity and they do not investigate the impact of interventions like our standardized test Unlike us they do not consider the case where the schools have imperfect observations of the students types Such work falls into a broader literature on optimal information structures eg The impact of information asymmetries is a common theme in economics today with key early work including Brocas and Carrillo Our model of signaling is inspired by the influential work on Bayesian Persuasion where a persuader played in our model by the school commits to revealing some fixed function of the types of the population it serves this revelation is used as the basis of a decision that impacts the welfare of both the decider and the persuader and the persuaders constituents The Bayesian Persuasion model has been applied to a variety of domains eg and generalizations and alternatives to this model have been studied in Recent work has explored algorithmic aspects of persuasion settings To our knowledge ours is the first work to consider access to population-level signaling Bayesian Persuasion or information design as a source of inequity Recent work on fairness has highlighted a number of objectives that one might wish to enforce when allocating resources to or making decisions about large numbers of individuals At a high level these objectives tend to focus either on ensuring group-level fairness or individual-level fairness The metrics we study expected utility false positive rates and false negative rates are generally considered to be metrics of group fairness but they also coarsely compare the extent to which similar individuals are being treated similarly One very interesting recent paper on fairness does incorporate Spence-style individual-level signaling in their model a worker can choose whether and how much to invest in human capital and this acts as an imperfect signal on whether the worker is qualified Although their model and its implications are very different from ours they similarly investigate the impact of upstream interventions on downstream group-level unfairness Similar notions of individual-level signaling can also be found in MODEL We consider a setting with high schools henceforth schools and a single university A school has a population of students Each student i has a binary type ti that represents the quality of the student The students types are drawn iid from a Bernoulli distribution with mean p that is a student has type p and p A students type is private that is known to the student but unknown to both the school and the university The prior p is public and common knowledge to all agents A school observes noisy information about the types of each of its students To formally model this we assume student i has a grade which is observed by the school but is unknown to the university The for student i is drawn as follows ti ti q for q That is the students type is flipped with some probability q As q increases the grade becomes amore accurate estimate of the students type ti The grade is known to the school but not the university The distribution q of the grade however is public ie common knowledge to all parties A school has access to a possibly trivial or uncountably infinite set of signals and commits to a signaling scheme mapping grades to probability distributions over signals in For each student i the university makes an accept/reject decision based on the distribution of the types p the distribution of the grades q and the realization of the signal chosen by the school The goal of the university is to maximize the quality of the students it accepts over the set of students it accepts with utility for accepting a student of high type ti and utility for a student with low type ti We assume that the university has unlimited capacity therefore the university accepts exactly those students who induce non-negative expected utility given the common priors and the signal its students who are admitted to the university We note that this choice of utility measures the access to opportunity defined as admittance to university of the schools students We refer to a school as revealing if it simply transmits the grade to the university as the signal We refer to a school as strategic if it employs the optimal strategic signaling scheme as examined in Section A strategic school thus maximizes its expected utility In several places we will discuss the distribution of students accepted by the university To do so it is useful to introduce the notions of false positive and false negative rates The false positive rate of a school is the expected probability that a student with type is accepted by the university The false negative rate of a school is the expected probability that a student with type is rejected by the university We introduce several assumptions that restrict our attention to settings of interest First we assume the expected quality of a student is negative such that the university would reject students without any signal from the school set q q and all results carry through by symmetry considers all students for admission Assumption The universitys expected utility for accepting any given student absent any auxiliary information is negative ie p p and therefore p Next we assume the universitys expected utility of accepting a student with a high low grade is positive negative Assumption The university has non-negative expected utility for accepting a student with a high grade and negative expected utility for accepting a student with a low grade Pr t Pr t Pr t Pr t These can be rewritten as p q p q We note that if the expected utility of accepting a student with a high grade were negative then none of the schools students would be admitted by the university under any signaling scheme On the other hand if the expected utility of accepting a student with a low grade were positive then the university would always accept every student in which the utilities of revealing and strategic schools may differ The following easy consequence of these assumptions will be useful in our analysis Observation Under Assumption Assumption implies q p We conclude with the following well-known result see eg Kamenica and Gentzkow that an optimal signaling scheme contains without loss of generality at most as many signals as there are actions available to the decision-maker In our setting this corresponds to restricting as the university makes an accept/reject decision for each student The result reproduced below for our setting follows from a revelation-principle type argument The idea is to replicate the utilities of a signaling scheme with many signals by first producing a signal according to the original scheme and then simply reporting to the university as a signal in the simplified scheme the action accept or reject that it would choose to take as a result of seeing the original signal Theorem Kamenica and Getzkow Suppose is a measurable but potentially uncountable set with at least two elements Let be such that Given any original signaling scheme mapping to there exists a new signaling scheme mapping to that induces the same utilities for the school and the university as those induced by the original scheme Further one can write such that a student with signal is accepted by the university with probability and a student with signal is rejected with probability When signals carry no information making mute the question of access to signaling schemes Therefore throughout the paper we make the assumption that and denote its elements by This is without loss of generality by the argument above THE IMPACTS OF SIGNALING SCHEMES The goal of this paper is to highlight the role of access to strategic signaling in creating unequal access to opportunity and explore the intervention of a standardized test as a way to combat this inequity In order to do so we first formulate optimal signaling schemes and then we study their impact on students and their relationship to noisy grades Optimal signaling scheme We first derive the optimal signaling scheme The idea is to pack low-quality students together with high quality students by giving both the accept signal A school is limited in the extent to which it can do so as it must ensure the university obtains non-negative expected utility by accepting all the students who have signal The following theorem provides the right balance Theorem The optimal signaling scheme for a school is Pr p q q p Pr Proof As per the revelation principle in Theorem we can let be a signal such that all students with that signal are accepted by the university and a signal such that all students with that signal are rejected Conditional on we can write the probabilities that a student is of each type as Pr t Pr t t t p q q Pr and similarly p q q Pr The universitys expected utility when accepting all those students with signal is non-negative if and only if such a student is at least as likely to be of type as of type that is Plugging in and rearranging this gives the constraint q p p q q p Recall that q p p q by Assumption and thus the constraint can be rewritten as q p q p p q p q q p The schools expected utility is Since is unconstrained the schools utility is maximized by setting it to The schools utility is similarly maximized by maximizing the value of which given the constraint occurs by setting p q q p p q q p Schools utility false positive and false negative rates In this section we calculate the expected utility false positive and false negative rate achieved by a school depending on the accuracy of its grades and whether it uses the optimal strategic signaling scheme when transmitting information about its students to the university These lemmas will form the basis of our evaluation of the impacts of strategic signaling in Section Recall that we refer to a school that does not strategically signal and instead transmits its raw grades to the university as revealing The proofs of the following Lemmas follow by direct calculations We provide an exposition of the more involved calculations of Lemmas and in the Appendix Lemma Revealing schools utility The expected utility Ur of a revealing school is Ur p q For the special case of a revealing school with accurate grades when q we have Ur p p A revealing school gets exactly the students with high grades accepted as per Assumption in particular a q fraction of high-type students will have a high grade and be accepted while a q fraction of the low-type students will be accepted Lemma Strategic schools utility A schools expected utility Us when it signals strategically is given by Us p q p q p For the special case of a strategic school with accurate grades when q we have Us p p A school that signals strategically gets exactly those students with a signal of accepted as per the revelation principle argument of Theorem a student with a high grade will be accepted with probability Pr and a student with a low grade with probability Pr with the probabilities chosen according to Theorem Lemma Revealing schools FPR/FNR When a school is revealing the false positive rate is given by FPR r q and the false negative rate by FNR r q For the special case of a revealing school with accurate grades when q we have FPR r p FNR r p In the case of a revealing school a low-type high-type student obtains a low high grade and gets rejected accepted with probability q ie if the grade does not match the type Lemma Strategic schools FPR/FNR When a school signals strategically the false positive rate is given by FPR s q q p q q p and the false negative rate by FNR s q p q p For the special case of a strategic school with accurate grades when q we have FPR s p p p and FNR s p In the case of a school that signals strategically according to Theorem a low-type student gets accepted with probability Pr if his grade is which occurs with probability q and probability Pr if his grade is which occurs with probability q On the other hand a high-type student gets rejected when his signal is because Pr this happens only when and the signal is ie with probability Pr t Remark While we chose to focus on average population ie school utility in this paper because of space constraints one can use these derivations of FRP and FNP to calculate the welfare of subpopulations such as low-type students at a revealing school which then implies population-level utility comparisons as well One interesting observation is that using the above Lemmas and Assumptions and one can see that the FPR of a strategic school is larger and the FNR smaller than that of a revealing school Thus while it is intuitively obvious that low-type students prefer a strategic school these calculations show that high-type students also prefer a strategic school and the preference is strict unless the assumptions hold with equality Consequences of strategic signaling for access to opportunity In this section we quantify the impact of access to strategic signaling and its interaction with accuracy of the information grades on which the signals are based We study both the resulting expected utility of a school as well as the resulting acceptance rates of both types of students We find that the ability to strategically signal always has a positive although bounded impact increasing students acceptance rates and the schools expected utility The benefit of strategic signaling for both students and the school improves boundedly so with the accuracy of the grades whereas a revealing school and its students receive potentially dramatically higher expected utility from noisy grades The following theorem is a direct consequence of Lemmas in the Appendix Theorem For all p and q q p the following hold accuracy in grades benefits strategic schools Us Us Us strategic schools have higher expected utility than revealing schools Ur Us Ur and accuracy in grades harms revealing schools pUr Ur Ur Further all above bounds are tight for some We see that perhaps counter-intuitively adding noise to the grades can help a revealing school get more students admitted up to a point grade increases the number of students with a high grade overall by Assumption as there are more low-type students whose representation increases as grade accuracy decreases than high-type students whose representation decreases as grade accuracy decreases Adding noise to grades is however a blunt instrument in that it drives up both false negatives and false positives see Lemma which limits its utility benefits The ability to signal strategically is more subtle driving up false positives and expected utility at no cost of false negatives The power of strategic signaling is maximized when schools have access to highly accurate grades Accurate information the ability to control the noise level of that information and most notably the ability to strategically signal about that information therefore constitute powerful drivers of unequal access to opportunity in settings where key information is transmitted to a decision-maker on behalf of a population We can derive comparisons resulting in similar insights for the false positive and false negative rates of revealing and strategic schools see Appendix INTERVENTION STANDARDIZED TEST The prior sections show that unequal access to strategic signaling can result in unequal access to opportunity This is driven by high error rates for students accepted from schools with signaling technologies and/or noisy grades The university has a vested interested in decreasing this error rate as it harms the universitys utility In addition an outside body or the university itself might be concerned about the resulting unequal access to opportunity In this section we explore the impact of a common intervention the standardized test While availability of a test score certainly can only improve the expected utility of the university has an ambiguous effect on the inequity In particular for a large range of parameter settings the introduction of a test can increase the inequality in access to opportunity and Schwarz test scores is zero and so can only increase For revealing schools the university gets strictly more information with test scores and hence more utility Augmented model Throughout this section we augment the model of Section to add the requirement that each student must take a test and the results of that test are visible both to the students school and to the university The school may then incorporate the test results into its subsequent strategic behavior We model the test score si of student i as a noisy estimate of ti conditionally independent from the grade obtained as follows ti ti for The score si is public ie the school and the university both observe it A school has access to a set of signals as before but now can design a signaling scheme that is a function of both the students grade and his test score ie the school designs Pr si for The university again makes accept/reject decisions that maximize its expected utility but now the university has access to the test score si and its distribution as well as the signal and the distributions p and q As before a strategic school chooses a signaling scheme that maximizes the fraction of students accepted whereas a revealing school simply transmits the grade to the university as the signal As in Section we introduce an assumption controlling the noise of the test Assumption The university has non-negative expected utility for accepting a student with a high test score and negative expected utility for accepting a student with a low test score p p We note that if the expected utility of accepting a student with a high test score were negative or the expected utility of accepting a student with a low test score were positive then in the absence of signals the university would always accept either none or all of the students Note that regimes when the standardized test is uninformative on its own but becomes informative when coupled with grades may still be interesting However even under Assumption which excludes certain parameter ranges from consideration we have a rich enough model to illustrate our main findings In the Appendix we show how to relax this assumption and how doing so affects the optimal signaling scheme The following consequence will be useful in our analysis Observation Under Assumption Assumption implies p Fixing p we denote by s the expected utility the university derives from admitting a student with score s and grade s s s When q is not defined for s as in this case s and are perfectly correlated For notational convenience we define in these cases without loss of generality Lemma Assumptions and together imply that the university receives non-negative expected utility from accepting a student with both a high grade and a high score and negative expected utility from a student with both a low grade and a low score This can be rewritten as p q p q Theorem the revelation principle also holds in this setting and so we assume for the remainder of this section that without loss of generality Optimal signaling We first derive the optimal strategic signaling scheme Again a school would like to pack low-quality students together with high quality students but is now limited in its ability to do so by their test scores If the expected utility the university receives from a student with a high grade but low test score is negative then this student and in fact any student with a low test score will be rejected regardless of the signal from the school Otherwise the school can signal to the university to accept such a student and can additionally pack in some low-grade-lowscore students subject to maintaining non-negative expected utility for the university Theorem The optimal signaling scheme for a school with access to grades and a test score under Assumption is Pr s Pr s Pr s if if Pr s if if We defer the proof to the Appendix Schools utility false positive and false negative rates In this section we calculate the expected utility achieved by both a strategic school and a revealing school as a function of the type distribution the accuracy of its grades and the accuracy of the standardized test score We defer all proofs to the Appendix For a revealing school the university always accepts high-grade high-score students If high grades are more informative than low test scores that is if which depends on p as well as q and and happens for instance if p q and then the university also accepts students with low test scores benefiting the school Alternatively if high test scores are more informative than low grades ie then the university also accepts students with low grades These conditions provide additional boosts to the utility of a revealing school Lemma Revealing schools utility The expected utility Ur of a revealing school with access to grades and a test score is Ur p q p p For the special case of a revealing school with accurate grades when q we have Ur p p As illustrated in Figure for fixed p and Ur may not be a decreasing function of q In fact when q is small enough the grades are completely uninformative and the university only admits students with a test score of In that regime the expected utility for a revealing school is therefore constant in q For intermediate values of q the grades are still uninformative on their own but are informative coupled with a high standardized test score at this point only students with both a score and a grade of get admitted by the university and the schools expected utility suddenly drops when compared to smaller q The schools expected utility in that regime is increasing in q as under Assumption increasing the value of q increases the fraction of students with both high scores and high grades Finally when q is large enough the grades are significant enough on their own that only students with high grades are admitted this leads to a jump in expected utility compared to the intermediate regime In this regime for high values of q the schools expected utility is decreasing as a result of the fact that increasing the value of q now decreases the number of students with a high grade by Assumption as seen in Section Lemma Strategic schools utility The expected utility Us when a school signals strategically and is Us p when the expected utility is Us p q p q p p q For the special case of a strategic school with accurate grades when q we have Us p p The expected utility of a strategic school is unsurprisingly monotone in q as illustrated in Figure as higher-quality information about its students types allows the school to signal more effectively For small and intermediate values of q ie insignificant grades the university bases admission decisions solely on the standardized test score and only admits students with a score of it has positive expected utility from doing so by Assumption in this regime a strategic schools expected utility is hence constant When q becomes large enough ie when the grades are significant enough the university starts having positive expected utility from admitting students with a high grade even if they have a low score and the school can start bundling these students together with the high score students leading to a jump in its expected utility The plotted parameters for the figures are chosen to satisfy Assumptions and the discontinuities occur at q such that and We also calculate the false positive and false negative rates of strategic and revealing schools we defer this derivation to the Appendix Impact of Standardized Test With a perfect standardized test or in fact a sufficiently good one ie high enough it is not hard to see that the university accepts exactly those students with a high test score from strategic as well as revealing schools Thus no matter the accuracy of the grades or distribution of types the standardized test results in equal expected utility and hence equal access to opportunity for revealing and strategic schools see Appendix for details Similarly if grades are accurate ie q then a revealing schools expected utility is fixed at p whereas a strategic schools expected utility is only diminished from p without the test by the extra constraints introduced by a standardized test Thus in this case as well a standardized test decreases the inequality between the utilities of a strategic and a revealing school making the ratio of utilities less than see Appendix for details Figure plots Us with and without test scores as a function of q for p and different values of The form of the utility ratio between a strategic and a revealing school in the absence of a test score follows from the fact that both utilities are continuous and that the expected utility of a strategic school increases while that of a revealing school decreases in q as we have seen in Section The form in the presence of a test score can be explained as follows First when in the regime of small values of q only students with a high standardized test score are admitted by the university in which case admission decisions do not depend on how the schools act and both the strategic school and the revealing school have the same expected utility leading to a ratio of For intermediate values of q we have previously discussed that the utility for a strategic school remains constant the university still has positive utility for students with a score of and the strategic school can bundle all such students together regardless of grade while the utility for a revealing school suddenly drops only students with both a high grade and a high score are admitted and is increasing in q explaining the sudden drop in ratio of utilities at the change of regime and the decreasing monotonicity of the ratio in q within the intermediate regime When q becomes large enough we have seen that both the revealing and the strategic school experience a jump in utilities which explains the second discontinuity in the ratio of utilities Because the revealing school has significantly lower utility than the strategic school for intermediate values of q the relative jump in the utility of a revealing school is higher than the relative jump in utility of a strategic school Because in the regime with high values of q the utility of a strategic school is increasing and that of a revealing school is decreasing the ratio of utilities is increasing Interestingly we observe that the introduction of a standardized test does not always decrease inequity For noisy grades when the test score is also sufficiently noisy the test may have the effect of increasing the ratio of utilities between a strategic school and a revealing school This is clearly illustrated in Figure where the curve with test scores sometimes lies above that without a test Some intuition for this result is as follows In the regime for intermediate values of q as q becomes more and more inaccurate the ratio of utilities in the presence of a standardized test increases and eventually overtakes the ratio in the absence of a standardized test which decreases to as the grades become more inaccurate In the regime for high values of q the university admits students with a high grade only independently of what their standardized test scores are therefore the utility of a revealing school is the same with or without a standardized test On the other hand when the standardized test score becomes more inaccurate the strategic school can take advantage of the noise in said score to bundle in more students than if there was no standardized test the university loses in utility from accepting unqualified students with high scores but at the same time gains in utility from accepting qualified students with low scores allowing a strategic school to bundle more students when compared to the case with no standardized test As decreases and the standardized test becomes less and less accurate a strategic school starts losing fewer high-score students to rejection than it gains in admitted low-score students and its utility increases FURTHER DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Our paper in introducing the study of inequity induced by population-level signaling raises a number of directions for future work We discuss a few of them here First one might be interested in enriching the model of the standardized test intervention For example there could be asymmetries in how students from different schools perform on the standardized test One might imagine students at an advantaged school might be better prepared for the test eg by investment in expensive test-prep courses giving them an edge in the form of an increased probability of performing well on the test Suppose for example that high-type students in an advantaged school had a higher probability of passing the test than high-type students at a disadvantaged school In such a situation more high-type students from the advantaged school would be admitted by the university and as the utility for the university to accept high score students increased the advantaged school could also bundle a larger number of low-type students with its high-type students That is a jump in high-types exam performance increases students utilities at that school even for low types this effect could further exacerbate disparities between and an advantaged and a disadvantaged school An interesting question could be to quantify how much disparities between schools would increase in such a setting One could also analyze other variants of advantage on the exam such as an increased probability of passing both for high-types and for low-types One might also imagine that students in an advantaged school might have access to more resources and could take the standardized test several times while students in a disadvantaged school could only take the test once When only the highest test score is reported to the university as is common in practice for university admissions in the United States it can be seen that this reduces to the situation described above in which students in each school take the standardized test exactly once but students in the advantaged school have a higher probability of passing An extreme case of such a situation would be when the advantaged schools students could take the test enough times that they would pass with a probability approaching in such a case a test score from the advantaged school would be meaningless to the university On the other hand the test would still be significant for the disadvantaged school and could have the effect of reducing the number of its students that are accepted further increasing disparities between schools A natural question would be to quantify such disparities for intermediate values of the number of times that an advantaged-school student can take the standardized test Finally throughout the paper we assume that the university has unlimited capacity and is willing to accept every student that provides it with non-negative expected utility One might ask what would happen if the university had a limited capacity The university might then rank students as a function of their school of origin their signal and their test score in the presence of a standardized test and only accepted the highest-ranked students If an advantaged school had the ability to make its students look better than a disadvantaged school for example an advantaged school might have more accurate grades and have a higher ability to strategically signal then the advantaged school could guarantee that some of its students would get first pick by the university to the detriment of a disadvantaged school which would only have access to the possibly small remaining capacity A natural direction would be to understand how much of an effect this limited capacity setting can have on inequity a b c d Figure Strategic school utility Us and revealing school utility Ur as a function of the grade accuracy q for average student type p We observe that the expected utility may be non-monotone in q a b c d Figure The ratio Us of utilities of a strategic school vs a revealing school as a function of the grade accuracy q with and without test
