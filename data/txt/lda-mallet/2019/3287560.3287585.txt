Clear Sanctions Vague Rewards How Chinas Social Credit System Currently Defines Good and Bad Behavior Chinas Social Credit System SCS 社会信用体系 or shehui xinyong tixi is expected to become the first digitally-implemented nationwide scoring system with the purpose to rate the behavior of citizens companies and other entities Thereby in the SCS good behavior can result in material rewards and reputational gain while bad behavior can lead to exclusion from material resources and reputational loss Crucially for the implementation of the SCS society must be able to distinguish between behaviors that result in reward and those that lead to sanction In this paper we conduct the first transparency analysis of two central administrative information platforms of the SCS to understand how the SCS currently defines good and bad behavior We analyze behavioral records and reports on citizens behaviors published on the official Beijing SCS website and the national SCS platform Credit China respectively By applying a mixed-method approach we demonstrate that there is a considerable asymmetry between information provided by the so-called Redlist information on good behavior and the Blacklist information on bad behavior At the current stage of the SCS implementation the majority of explanations on blacklisted behaviors includes a detailed description of the causal relation between inadequate behavior and its sanction On the other hand explanations on redlisted behavior which comprise positive norms fostering value internalization and integration are less transparent Finally this first SCS transparency analysis suggests that socio-technical systems applying a scoring mechanism might use different degrees of transparency to achieve particular behavioral engineering goals CONCEPTS Social and professional topics Government technology policy Information systems Decision support systems Security and privacy Social aspects of security and privacy Applied computing Anthropology KEYWORDS Social Credit System Socio-Technical Systems Transparency Behavioral Engineering INTRODUCTION Moral thinking and action necessarily depend on informational resources When an individual asks What is the right thing to do he or she essentially relies on information that renders a conclusion morally justifiable In philosophy and anthropology descriptive morality refers to how groups or societies negotiate codes of conduct or norms that are morally acceptable or unacceptable As a consequence an individuals moral accountability tends to be proportional to his or her knowledge of good and bad moral behavior underlining the epistemic character of morality In the Chinese government issued a plan for a nationwide digital scoring system known as the Chinese Social Credit System SCS classifying behavior into morally praise- and blameworthy Thereby all legal entities including companies and public institutions among others receive an -digit ID called the Unified Social Credit Code which corresponds to the -digit ID card number for last accessed on November Chinese citizens Presumably based on these IDs the SCS will collect and evaluate behavioral data and may assign scores that result in material benefits and reputational praise or material exclusion and reputational loss Or in the words of the Chinese government the goal of the SCS is to allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step But how can citizens companies and social institutions know what behaviors are good and bad in the SCS Put differently how transparent is the current SCS in providing information on good and bad behaviors Answering this question requires a conceptualization of transparency Here we rely on the definition proposed by Turilli and Floridi which conceptualizes transparency as the choice of which information is to be made accessible to some agents by an information provider First this definition distinguishes between an information provider which makes information accessible in this context the Chinese government and agents or entities that depend on this information for their decision-making Secondly this definition recognizes that information transparency is an ethically impairing or enabling factor when the information disclosed has an impact on ethical principles Both of these components are highly relevant for the SCS since participants are dependent on the information provided to make decisions that can lead to reward or punishment Recently the Chinese government has started issuing behavioral information on several platforms see Section for more information In this empirical study we review a subset of this behavioral information released on two central SCS platforms the official SCS national website Credit China and its equivalent municipal outlet Credit China Beijing On the former site we collect and analyze news reports about good behaviors we refer to as positive cases and equivalent reports about bad behaviors negative cases In these negative portraits individuals are commonly stereotyped as so-called Laolai 老赖 the epitome of a financially dishonest individual in China Since all stories we collected are news reports about real-life events portraying a morally good or bad individual they all include descriptive norms highlighting desirable and undesirable characteristics of individuals in Chinese society today Next on Credit China Beijing we retrieve a large number of records of good and bad behavior from the so-called Redlist and Blacklist Thus our approach is as follows first we collect and statistically analyze close to Blacklist and Redlist records from beijinggovcn/creditbj the SCSs information platform for Chinas capital Beijing Hence based on machine learning topic modeling andmanual text coding we identify the common semantic patterns of close to reports on good and bad behavior published on the national SCS platform wwwcreditchinagovcn We show several informational asymmetries that characterize the current degree of transparency of the governmental SCSs information platforms Finally we discuss how degrees of transparency could correspond to different incentive strategies of socio-technical systems that rate legal entities in society Our paper has the following structure In Section we discuss the development of Chinas SCS and review related work In Section we present our data acquisition and data analysis approach We conduct our analysis in Sections and We discuss our results and offer concluding remarks in Section BACKGROUND The implementation of the SCS rests on at least three main factors First lack of honesty and trust in Chinese society has become a serious issue manifested in the numerous news reports about food poisonings chemical spills financial and telecommunications fraud and academic dishonesty over the past two decades It is estimated that Chinese enterprises suffer from a loss of billion RMB around billion USD per year due to dishonest activities According to a survey conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs moral decline was regarded as the most serious issue in China in of Chinese respondents ranked it as one of the top greatest concerns while the same issue was only mentioned by of total respondents worldwide Secondly Chinas SCS is expected to boost the domestic economy The Chinese government hopes that the SCS will give millions of Chinese citizens without a financial history access to credit and investment opportunities in the domestic market China has the largest unbanked population in the world in absolute numbers with more than million citizens having no bank account So far only million Chinese citizens have a credit record However the sustainability of Chinas economic growth partially depends on an increase in domestic spending Through the SCS citizens could apply for loans based on trustworthiness scores without having to prove their financial creditworthiness Finally in Chinese society the concept of personal identity is largely determined by Confucian principles Accordingly personhood is supposed to extend from the private to the public sphere thereby somewhat losing its private and public boundaries In other words normative expectations on individuals hardly account for the distinction between a private and a public sphere The division between a private and a public persona is often conceived as trying to be secretive as privacy is commonly conceived as hiding something shameful In fact until recently privacy was primarily protected under the right of reputation in Chinese civil law At the same time the public interest ranks highly in Chinese civil law private information protected from disclosure refers to information that is irrelevant to the public interest or to the interests of other persons However while the Chinese concept of privacy is evolving it is expected to remain distinct from other societies Overall the introduction of the SCS is hardly perceived as a privacy-violating system in Chinese society which is perhaps surprising from a Western perspective Current state of the SCS At the current stage the SCS remains fragmented being developed at national provincial municipal and ministerial levels with no clear unified structure In the past years provinces and cities have The characters 诚信 chengxin literally mean both honesty and trust in Chinese This information is included in the Report on Chinas Honesty Building Situation Zhongguo Chengxin Jianshe Zhuangkuang Baogao The full report is not publicly available but parts of the report in Chinese are accessible through peoplecomcn/n///c-html last accessed onNovember See Inspiration of the US Non-traditional Credit Information Mechanism available on the platform of Credit China at tashanzhishi//t_html last accessed on November developed various prototype models for the SCS Importantly the SCS also takes companies government departments and judicial organizations as its targets This means that some companies have a special role in the SCS Since eight companies were granted permission to run individual credit services with the purpose to implement pilot SCS programs Individually none of the eight companies received a licence to continue individual credit services after the two-year trial period ended in Instead together with the China Internet Finance Association run by the Peoples Bank of China they recently have become common shareholders of a company called Baihang Credit which received the first credit scoring licence in February Related Work We are unaware of any research project that conducts a data-driven analysis of the currently observable data practices of key sites of Chinas SCS However we have identified two empirical research studies that help understand how the SCS is being communicated and discussed by Chinese media and how it is being perceived by Chinese citizens Ohlberg et al collected official Chinese news articles and public communications as well as social media postings on Chinese blogs forums and bulletin board services about the SCS for a six-month period in The large majority of news articles has a positive focus and highlight the SCS as a cure-all for social and economic problems Criticism is mostly aimed at the slow implementation progress or directed at commercial initiatives in the SCS Citizens social media postings rarely address privacy issues and rather focus on how to game the system to achieve a higher social credit score within commercial SCS applications Of relevance to the latter point the implications of gamifying social credit are also being discussed from a non-empirical perspective by other scholars Kostka conducted an online survey with about Chinese citizens that was distributed via different channels including websites and apps Due to the widespread internet surveillance in China the validity of such online surveys remains questionable at least to some extent According to her findings about of the respondents have a positive perception of governmental and commercial SCS initiatives Interestingly older and more educated respondents have a higher approval rating In contrast these demographic factors are typically associated with higher privacy concerns in Western societies see for example Several policy papers address the relationship between the SCS and the danger of mass surveillance eg Finally there is rigorous work on comparing financial credit reporting systems which however predates the emergence of the SCS in China and focuses on the financial aspects of credit reporting Likewise privacy considerations concerning private entities facilitating credit and background reporting have for example been explored by Hoofnagle Ethical Issues Our analysis is built on publicly available data from key sites of Chinas SCS which is posted with the intent of public scrutiny Our paper includes screenshots from the currently available implementations We have blurred any personally identifiable data Number of Topics Co he re nc e Sc or e Negative Positive Figure Coherence score Cv for topic models of negative and positive case studies using different topic counts METHODS We used computer-assisted content analysis methods to explore the level of transparency of current behavioral information published on the two previously mentioned SCS websites First the column-and-row structured records of both the Blacklist and the Redlist on the SCSs Beijing platform were crawled and statistically evaluated Hence to understand the semantic and structural patterns of both positive and negative case studies we crawled news reports on bad behavior labeled as Typical Cases 典型案例 and on good behavior labeled as Stories of Integrity 诚信人物/故事 under the section of Integrity Culture 诚信文化 on the national SCS information platform Credit China We then applied statistical topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA to all available news reports on good behavior positive cases and news reports on bad behavior negative cases on August We preprocessed the downloaded documents by applying jieba for segmentation and stopword filtering of Chinese text We used the stopword corpus compiled by the Chinese search engine Baidu After tokenization of the given text we applied tf-idf to re-weigh term counts As we had no reasonable expectation for the number of topics  to be detected within the given document corpus we performed optimal topic number search Thereby we created several LDA models for positive and negative case studies and calculated the topic coherence measures Cv as proposed in We started with  and increased the number of topics until an upper bound of  As shown in Figure coherence values of models for both document sets increased until  before flattening out Therefore we investigated the top- most salient terms for each of the fifteen topics produced by these models Thereby we set  within the applied relevance metric Figure Three lists publishing records of negative behavior from left to right the first arrow points to Blacklist the second arrow to Special Attention List and the third arrow to Administrative Punishment Moreover we also reviewed the results for   and  in order to further manually verify the optimal topic number We found the optimal model with  for both positive and negative cases Finally we further selected main topics for the positive cases and topics for the negative cases see Table in the Supplementary Materials for topics selected for the positive cases and Table in the Supplementary Materials for negative case topics Based on our topic modeling results we selected the most related cases highest predicted probability of belonging to the topic for each of the topics We then manually analyzed positive cases and negative cases in detail One author first reviewed positive and negative cases respectively and drafted a coding guide which was then reviewed iteratively by another author refined and retested to generate consistent definitions As a result we developed two coding schemes for positive and negative cases see Table for the coding scheme applied to positive cases and see Table for the coding scheme used to analyze negative cases After reliability was established we examined all cases for structural and thematic commonalities Each coding sheet contained the information from one positive or negative case Once the coding sheets were completed we grouped and analyzed the information contained in them RESULTS Blacklists On the platform of Credit China Beijing we found three publicly accessible databases providing information on bad behavior all of which could be queried by search term Translated from Chinese see Figure they were termed the following Blacklist entries Special Attention List entries and Administrative Punishment entries The Blacklist further contained subcategories for bad behavior For the Blacklist we crawled two of these subcategories one containing records of individuals that have been banned from For negative cases there are only three cases for Topic measures taken against crime and Topic public transport regulation violation respectively There were only cases for out of the topics Pattern Definition Example Bio-info full name 今年岁的刘某某为了一句诺 言一辈子踏踏实实做一名小村 大医生 age

listing companies with debts Blacklist of Company Debtors entries of all Blacklist entries For the Blacklist of individuals all entries included extensive explanations for the punishment eg length of ban referencing financial law see Figure Apart from the censored ID card number the full names of all individuals were published Due to the large amount of company records we found on the Blacklist the Special Attention List and Administrative Punishment we crawled the first pages for these lists For the Blacklist of companies with financial debt this resulted in a total of entries all of which featured information on why an entity had been blacklisted see Figure Out of these entries entries specified that the financial obligation had not been fulfilled Figure An entry from the Blacklist of

these explanations we crawled the date of publication on the Blacklist for each entry We found that on one day in June of all entries had been published on the Blacklist for companies see Figure This probably indicates that these records had already been collected and processed by another entity before being transferred to and published on the Blacklist For the Special Attention List we collected entries containing information on companies that had violated business operation regulations For all records collected companies had been blacklisted for providing various types of false information to the authorities see Figure Finally our crawler returned entries for the Administrative Punishment register that contained information on both Figure Screenshot of a companys Blacklist entry Left column the first arrow points to a field explaining the specific context of the case the second arrow points to the date of publication of this entry on the Blacklist Figure Publication dates of Blacklist entries for company debtors individuals and companies see Figure As Figure shows the majority of records of the Administrative Punishment register reported traffic rule violations Correspondingly fines were the most widely used measure see Figure We also found that only company entries of the Administrative Punishment register and the Blacklist consistently featured the Unified Social Credit Code On the national SCS information platform China Credit we found another Blacklist issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China 中国民用航空局 This list which is updated every month publishes information on individuals that are excluded from aircraft travel for a period of one year due to misbehavior on airplanes or airports data collected on August see Figure According to the list published in August individuals were banned from air travel for one year Among others the list provided full name censored ID number and explanations why individuals had been punished see three arrows in the first row of Figure Being banned from air travel resulted from taking illegal objects on airplanes smoking on airplanes or boarding airplanes last accessed on November Figure The top reasons for companies to be on the Special Attention List Figure A record of the Administrative Punishment register The first column from top to down the first arrow points to the field type of punishment and the second points to the field reasons for punishment Figure The top reasons why individuals or companies are placed on the Administrative Punishment register Figure The types of Administrative Punishments with a fake passport The figure also indicates that the list contained names and ID numbers of non-Chinese citizens providing some evidence that foreigners were not excluded from the SCS Redlist We found one type of list documenting information on good behavior  the Redlist It contained a total of entries distributed across categories categories for redlisted individuals categories for redlisted companies The categories for individuals translated from Chinese are Taxi Star entries Top Ten Tour Guides entries and Five-Star Volunteer entries For all entries the full name of the person and his or her partially censored ID number were given The Five-Star Volunteer category displayed the gender of the person as well as the amount of volunteering hours carried out per person The lowest amount of volunteering hours documented was which was probably the necessary threshold to be listed and the highest was None of the entries we collected from the Redlist provided an explanation justifying why such a honorary title had been awarded to that person see Figure Thus we cannot report any observations about justifications on good behavior from our Beijing Redlist analysis Company categories referred either to tax awards eg A Class Taxpayer or to other honorable statuses such as Harmonious Labor Relations or Excellent Contributor to Developing Chinese Socialism Just like the Redlist entries of individuals there were no justifications explaining why a honorable title had been awarded to a company No Redlist entry contained the Unified Social Credit Code Generally Figure shows a single record of an entity that can display several positive and negative entries Thus there is reason to believe that the interface shown in Figure functions as the governmental SCS information template recording and making transparent information on rewards and/or sanctions to the public Importantly every Blacklist and Redlist record we collected featured a Disagreement/Correction 异议/纠错 function see Figure This function allowed citizens to object to a Blacklist or Redlist decision by providing a statement of up to Chinese characters submission required -digit ID number Coding results for positive cases on good behavior News reports on good behavior were introduced as Stories of Integrity 诚信人物/故事 posted under the section of Integrity Culture 诚信文化 on the national SCS information platform Credit China All of the positive cases selected described how a protagonist sacrificed his or her self-interest both material and non-material for the common good Moreover all cases centered on trustworthiness and honesty as key SCS virtues The stories all followed the same narrative structure they first provided detailed biographical information of a person full name social class profession family status followed by a dilemma the protagonist could either engage in dishonest behavior winning him or her an immediate small reward or get a large future reward by being honest Once the person had enacted the honest behavior which happened in all the positive reports we analyzed the narratives ended with a virtue cascade Take for example cases in which individuals found and returned lost property to an owner Here all four cases assigned to the topic return lost property to owner ended by further attributing self-discipline helpfulness care-taking for others and a sense of responsibility to the protagonist as part of a virtue cascade Another commonality across the selected cases was that all protagonists were morally praised by their social environment Also the protagonist was recognized for his or her good behavior by official agencies or the media in the form of honors decorations or a cute nickname On the other hand when a material reward was offered for the good behavior as in all cases with topics family and community relationship and repayment return lost property to owner and social entrepreneurship to help people out of poverty the protagonist refused the material reward at all times Coding results for negative cases on bad behavior Reports about bad behavior were labeled as Typical Cases 典 型案例 on the homepage of Credit China with the sources being both local newspapers and the platform itself The selected negative cases relating to topics all revolved around one common theme the Laolai 老赖 a term specifically referring to individuals and companies refusing to repay debts These cases were presented in two ways The cases with the topic public shaming were about the courts actions in solving repayment problems The remainder of the stories were about specific individuals or companies All individuals and companies were anonymous in the selected cases Local courts collaborated with local telecommunication companies in all cases with the topic public shaming and the Public Security Bureau played an important enforcement role in all cases with topic public transport regulation violation In these reports both the compulsory actions taken by the court and the threat of being placed on the Blacklist forced the Laolai to fulfill the stated obligation Generally both positive and negative case studies we analyzed were homogeneous in structure framing and content This could indicate that they had been deliberately formulated to propagate the SCSs conceptualization of good and bad behavior Figure A screenshot of the Blacklist for individuals that are banned from flying on commercial airplanes In the first row from left to right the first arrow points a field containing the full name of the individual the second to censored ID number and the third to explanations why individuals have been punished Two arrows at the bottom left indicate entries of two foreign passengers Figure Example of a companys Blacklist entry The black circle on the upright corner indicates the Disagreement/Correction 异 议/纠错 function ANALYSIS The results of our content analysis demonstrate that there are currently multiple informational asymmetries in both datasets Listed companies versus listed individuals Currently companies make up the majority of entries on both the Blacklist and Redlist of Beijings SCS platform We found that companies which are involved in the construction of the SCS were also included in the list For instance Alibaba with Zhima Credit and Tencent with Tencent Credit were both granted permission to start individual pilot credit service programs in and have provided digital data collected from online shopping and social media to the SCS Both Alibaba and Tencent were listed as A-level Taxpayers on the Redlist Since we only crawled the Beijing SCS platform we cannot make any claims about the transparency of other SCS Blacklist and Redlist websites Our analysis of positive and negative cases demonstrates the opposite here the majority of reports on either good or bad behavior focuses on individuals behaviors For our manually coded sample only of negative reports and of positive reports featured companies In both negative and positive cases that featured companies however reports centered on the person in charge of the company typically highlighting the CEOs virtues and vices In other words it is not the company as such that is blamed or praised but rather the person responsible for the company Such portraits therefore signal that individuals are not shielded by large institutions but can be made responsible for their good or bad decision-making Justifying punishments versus justifying rewards All entries of the Blacklist explain why a person or company is currently registered on the Blacklist Moreover Blacklist explanations include legal terms and refer to laws and regulations In other words Blacklist explanations make transparent the mechanism of punishment by specifying a causal link between behavior and consequence This is perhaps best illustrated by the Blacklist on individuals excluded from air travel see Figure The legal threat contained in the entries of the Blacklist could furthermore signal that a specific dishonest behavior can be detected and sanctioned On the other hand not a single entry of the Redlist includes a formulated explanation on why a person or company has been awarded a honorary title We found that fulfilling legal obligations Class A Taxpayer performing professional Taxi Star or volunteering Five-Star Volunteer duties can result in reputational gain in the current SCS However the mechanisms or criteria determining when an individual or a company secures a place on the Redlist are not further explained Taken together the current SCS makes behaviors leading to punishments more transparent than behaviors Figure Example of a Redlist entry for an individual with the honorary title Five-Star Volunteer The record does not justify why the honorary title was awarded resulting in rewards More generally our study could not identify publicly available information associating specific behaviors to a scoring or rating mechanism Types of punishments versus types of incentives The most common reason for a company to be placed on any of the negative lists is failure to pay back debt the second most common reason is informational misconduct Failure to pay back debt is also the most prominent reason given for why protagonists of the negative cases are registered on the Blacklist The Chinese term for Laolai appeared times in the negative reports we collected All negative stories we manually coded report on the activities of a Laolai person either as an individual or as the legal representative of a company In terms of punishment individuals and companies face both the material loss specified in the corresponding legal regulation as well as the consequences of being publicly shamed on the Blacklist In more than of the narratives on negative behavior an individual is threatened to be placed on the Blacklist leading to the immediate compliance of the individual On the other hand individuals and companies on the Redlist receive moral approval and reputational gain Similarly positive cases report on individuals that gain reputational rewards while at the same time rejecting material incentives when offered as a consequence of their role-model behavior Still being listed on the Redlist is not mentioned or even indicated by any individuals as a motivational factor for their behaviors All stories we analyzed emphasize that a morally praiseworthy activity is praiseworthy when it is genuinely moral rather than instrumental in obtaining a material reward Furthermore all positive stories feature a virtue cascade once an individual is described as genuinely honest or trustworthy he or she is attributed other positive virtues as a consequence DISCUSSION CONCLUDING REMARKS In this first study of key websites of the Chinese SCS our goal was to understand how transparent the SCS currently is in providing information on good and bad behavior To this end we collected and analyzed Blacklist and Redlist entries from the Beijing SCS website beijinggovcn/creditbj and applied a machine learning topic modeling algorithm to almost reports on positive and negative behavior crawled from the national SCS information platform wwwcreditchinagovcn Finally we manually coded a sample of these texts to understand what kind of specific behavioral information they contain The main question arising from our findings we believe is whether the degree of the current SCSs transparency is intentionally engineered or whether it is simply a manifestation of work in progress Is there a purpose in explicitly describing and publishing the causal link between behavior and sanction while leaving information on getting rewards deliberately vague First the asymmetries in information provided between the Redlist and the Blacklist could be motivated economically while an infinite amount of people can be excluded from valuable material resources only a finite amount can be given valuable resources eg a first-class train ticket Detailed instructions on how to win rewards could therefore lead to distribution problems since many individuals could implement them On the other hand another explanation for the current informational asymmetries of the SCS might be that already existing records of legal offenses were used to start filling Blacklists Consequently these records entail more justifications since they refer to specific legal articles or regulations The degree of transparency of the SCS observed in this work could also be motivated by behavioral engineering goals Lets imagine for the moment the system were completely inscrutable ie the system did not justify a score increase or decrease and eventually a given punishment or reward respectively In this case individuals would have little possibility to understand when the SCS rewarded and when it sanctioned specific types of behaviors Moreover besides being oblivious to the moral code of conduct individuals would not have the ability to contest the systems decision-making process again to negotiate a norm one must have the necessary epistemic resources to do so Note that this issue is also debated in the context of the Right to Explanation of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation A fully transparent scoring system on the other hand would precisely map behaviors to rewards or sanctions Indeed in the context of a nationwide digitally-implemented scoring system full transparency must account for the mechanism that leads to the distribution of rewards or sanctions This degree of transparency would offer individuals the possibility to understand the systems decision-making procedures at least to a certain extent In our analysis of SCS Blacklist and Redlist records we did not identify an explicit SCS scoring mechanism We have shown however that the SCS already enables citizens to dispute single Blacklist and Redlist records On the other hand a fully transparent SCS would possibly create other problems if the SCS became fully transparent in regard to its scoring mechanisms complying to a norm would likely become a market transaction In fact research on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation suggests that introducing an external reward to a norm-guided behavior turns this behavior into a commodity that can be bought This phenomenon termed crowding-out effect results in fewer people engaging in this behavior since the consequences of failing to act can simply be compensated by financial means For example if one reliably receives monetary compensation for being honest being honest will no longer be evaluated as a moral behavior for both the actor and the recipient As this line of research suggests individuals will likely stop attributing a genuine moral character to individuals with a high score in a fully transparent SCS Our analysis provides evidence that the currently implemented SCS possibly attempts to counter such a transformation of moral behavior into market transactions All of the positive case studies unambiguously emphasize that norm conformity is good because it is morally valuable for both average citizens as well as CEOs None of the Redlist entries describe a connection between moral behavior and external material reward Rather they contain virtue signals and reputational gains by awarding symbolic honorary titles eg Five-Star Volunteer On another sub-page of the national SCS website we found the publication of ancient Chinese fables not shown also promoting self-concepts comprising virtues of being a morally good Chinese citizen In contrast our analysis on the corpus of negative case studies demonstrates the propagation of a negative self-concept Laolai attributable to a specific offense ie intentionally not paying back debt Taken together our analysis suggests that degrees of transparency can serve different behavioral engineering goals in the context of a digital scoring system
