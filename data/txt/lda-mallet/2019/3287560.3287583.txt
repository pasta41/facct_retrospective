SIREN A Simulation Framework for Understanding the Effects of Recommender Systems in Online News Environments The growing volume of digital data stimulates the adoption of recommender systems in different socioeconomic domains including news industries While news recommenders help consumers deal with information overload and increase their engagement their use also raises an increasing number of societal concerns such as Matthew effects filter bubbles and the overall lack of transparency We argue that focusing on transparency for content-providers is an under-explored avenue As such we designed a simulation framework called SIREN SImulating Recommender effects in online News environments that allows content providers to i select and parameterize different recommenders and ii analyze and visualize their effects with respect to two diversity metrics Taking the US news media as a case study we present an analysis on the recommender effects with respect to long-tail novelty and unexpectedness using SIREN Our analysis offers a number of interesting endings such as the similar potential of certain algorithmically simple item-based k-Nearest Neighbour and sophisticated strategies based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking to increase diversity over time Overall we argue that simulating the effects of recommender systems can help content providers to make more informed decisions when choosing algorithmic recommenders and as such can help mitigate the aforementioned societal concerns CONCEPTS Information systems Recommender systems Applied computing Publishing Computing methodologies Simulation tools KEYWORDS recommender systems diversity news media simulation INTRODUCTION Recommender systems play a vital role in dealing with the abundance of online content available In domains as diverse as e-commerce the music and lm industry social media platforms and the news media recommender systems are deployed to help consumers deal with an information overload by providing filtered and personalized suggestions At the same time they help content providers to increase user engagement/satisfaction and boost sales In line with broader concerns about the societal consequences of digital technologies such recommender systems are not without criticism While some scholars herald these as ways to bring niche items to the attention of the wider public others argue that recommender systems mostly benefit the already popular items by recommending those even more Recommender systems create in this way what sociologist Merton refers to as Matthew effects the rich get richer and the poor get poorer These concerns about recommender systems reducing diversity have become particularly salient in the public domain where fears of an increasing societal fragmentation the so-called echo chambers and filter bubbles are widespread Moreover as these recommender systems operate by complex and opaque algorithms they generally suffer from a lack of transparency and user control To address these issues this paper focuses on one particular domain where the use of recommender systems by content providers play an important role namely the news industry Since recommenders predominantly deliver information that aligns with peoples current interests and preferences they can drive homogeneity and could lower peoples chances to encounter different and not yet discovered contents opinions and viewpoints Since the media form an arena for public debate in which a diversity of voices should be heard it would have detrimental consequences to the functioning of our democracies However certain works argue that these concerns might have the signs of a moral panic since it is far from clear whether recommender systems have such fragmenting effects A growing number of studies actually contend that these claims are exaggerated since people actively gather and consume news in many different contexts Moreover it can be questioned whether information specialization is necessarily detrimental to democratic debates or that exposure to a diversity of opinions is by definition good for society The point is that more empirical research is needed to assess the effects of recommender systems Analyzing their effects is however a complex task considering the resources needed to track user behavior in different algorithmic regimes not to mention the consequent ethical concerns In addition online news consumption is governed by a complex interaction between the users preferences the content providers intent that translates to editorial priming and the webpage-nature of the medium This paper presents a synthetic alternative that we argue is nevertheless able to shed light on these issues a simulation framework which allows for the visualization and analysis of the effects of different recommenders systems This simulation is based on empirical data and while a perfect correspondence to reality cannot be guaranteed such simulations do provide clear insights into the tendencies recommender algorithms exhibit Our simulation draws mainly on the work of Fleder and Hosanagar who modeled consumer behavior in an e-commerce context To account for the specificities of news consumption we go beyond an exclusive focus on recommendation and include both users preferences and editorial priming as they interact in a news-webpage context We named our framework SIREN SImulating Recommender effects in online News environments It is open-source and enables content providers to insert their own specifications and to test different recommender systems deployed in different contexts The adjustable parameters of SIREN pertain to the items articles users readers as well as the recommendation algorithms themselves as seen in Figure SIREN currently allows for the evaluation with respect to long-tail diversity and unexpectedness diversity metrics to address the Matthew and filter-bubble effects respectively By raising awareness of the consequences of deploying different algorithms a concrete form of making algorithms more transparent SIREN allows content providers to test the effects of the recommendation algorithms they have in mind with few resources In this work we not only describe the design and implementation of SIREN key contribution I but also consider a specific case study the US news media and evaluate the effect of different recommender algorithms on long-tail diversity and unexpectedness metrics key contribution II BACKGROUND Algorithmic transparency is an important goal in todays technologically saturated world especially as the workings of algorithm systems are difficult to grasp for non-experts Furthermore empirical analyses of algorithms typically require considerable resources time data effort and computational power and do not allow for the hypothetical testing of alternatives Simulations can be used as a means to analyze the consequences of different recommender algorithms If based on solid empirical data and adequately parameterized simulations can inform interested stakeholders about the effects of whatever algorithm they are interested in testing The outcomes of such simulations help those who commission the implementation of recommender systems to be better informed when deciding what algorithms to deploy for the normative and/or commercial purposes they have in mind In the following sections we make a case for using a simulation and enumerate the requirements for this simulation Making the case for simulations Simulations have been predominately used for evaluating and analyzing algorithms with respect to different metrics eg accuracy or diversity and application-scenarios such as e-commerce e-learning personalized news and others In an e-commerce context Fleder and Hosanagar propose a simulation framework to evaluate recommenders in terms of sales diversity They propose a mathematical model of user behavior that simulates user awareness preferences and choice A similar work by Hinz and Eckert focuses on the evaluation in terms of video-on-demand consumption Their model is based on economics and marketing studies but a number of parameters are calibrated based on real-life sales data Umeda et al focus on evaluating collaborative filtering approaches In contrast to other works their model incorporates the interaction among users In an e-learning context Nadolski et al evaluate recommenders in a scenario where learners need to be advised about the next learning activity to follow Manouselis et al identify the best collaborative filtering strategy for an online teachers community Their work is based on a Web-based application that allows the creation of synthetic datasets by arbitrarily defining properties eg the number of users Sie et al use simulations to investigate coalition recommendations ie advising users to choose the right people to collaborate within a network In an online news context MÃ¶ller et al evaluate different recommender algorithms by focusing on the algorithms diversity with respect to content-based features eg topic or tone In contrast to previous simulation works the authors generate recommendations based on a static snapshot of user data but do not specify a mathematical model of user behavior At a more theoretical level Lamprecht et al propose new evaluation measures for the concepts of discoverability helping users to reach items and navigability helping users to explore a collection Navigability in particular is measured by simulating the user behavior modeled through information seeking models where users move from item to item using links such as related movies in a movie web-page In order to investigate the relationship among diversity metrics Vargas proposes a probabilistic model of user behavior The model considers diversity in the temporal domain and incorporates a user browsing model ie the probability of a recommended item being selected relates to its ranking position Despite the large amount of simulation works we argue that none of the listed simulation models can accommodate for the particularities of news consumption in an online news environment The next section elaborates on the specificities of online news Requirements for the news context In a news context the simulations conceptual model should capture the general mechanics of article publishing and consumption At the Figure SIRENs user interface recommender settings news article settings and user ie news reader settings can be adjusted at will The bottom row shows the generated visualizations for different metrics and different recommender algorithms same time the models parameterization should accurately capture the specific intent of both users and content providers eg what users want to read and what content providers want users to read Online news articles have a very distinctive nature that separates them from other Web objects such as movies and music Li et al argue that typical recommendation strategies need to be adapted to accommodate for a number of unique news-article characteristics such as their large volumes and short-term relevancy Another unique characteristic relates to the nature of the medium in which articles typically reside News articles do not exist in isolation but appear within the websites layout and overall content Editorial cues such as position or font sizes are frequently used to lead the reading consumption and to adjust the salience of the recommendations The news-reading behavior is also unique departing from the typical show me something interesting attitude A number of works suggest that besides the casual information seekers online news accommodate the needs of users with specific preferences and interests Finally it has been suggested that those user preferences are likely to evolve over time and thus personalized news recommendations might have long-term effects We define three requirements that a simulation model of online news with personalized recommendations should satisfy in order to adequately approximate reality users distribute their reading time between prominent sought out and recommended articles user preferences evolve the prominence ranking of articles is based on editorial cues such as their position on the news website SIREN Based on the requirements identified above we now present our simulation framework with a strong emphasis on the simulation model which takes Fleders and Hosanagars model FH from now on of consumers and products as a starting point FH considers a map of users consumers and items products in an n-dimensional feature space The products position describes its properties while the consumers position corresponds to their ideal product FH model uses such a two-dimensional space as its simulations input for the sake of simplicity and visualization Under FH items centered around the origin correspond to popular items At each iteration of the simulation the users are aware of items in their spatial proximity and popular items In addition at each iteration recommended items are permanently added to the users awareness For each user FH decides the items they purchase based on their distance to the user and an uncertainty component that allows users to deviate from their personal preferences After a number of iterations the simulation is complete while the user preferences and collection of items remain static throughout Similar to FH our model assumes that there are U users ie readers and T items ie articles placed in an -dimensional attribute R Each iteration of the simulation corresponds to a news cycle eg a day Readers are aware of i articles in their proximity corresponding to preferred/sought out topics via search or navigation bars ii promoted articles by the editors as they appear on the news website and iii personalized recommended articles T as they appear on the website or via email alerts sent to the reader At each iteration each user decides to read a number of unique articles from those they are aware of At the end of each iteration the users are updated The article pool T and the personalized recommendations are also updated at every iteration while each article has a limited life-span Under this model we identify three main interacting components that SIRENs interface gives content providers control over cf Figure the articles that translate to specific publishing habits the users the readers preferences and reading behavior and the recommendations articles promoted to each user We now describe the different components of our model in detail We then present the metrics which we visualize in SIRENs interface Finally since this model has been implemented in our framework we conclude this section with a description of SIRENs technology stack Articles As previously discussed in Section a successful simulation model of online news consumption should consider the articles content and article prominence Content Under FH the dimensions of the plane correspond to arbitrary features In our case we decided for the articles products and readers consumers to be placed in a content-driven topic space since getting online news is a deliberate experience that may vary depending on the topic Typically in marketing analyses where FH comes from two-dimensional product space is obtained by performing multivariate analysis eg PCA t-SNE on the high dimensional feature space In order to generate a meaningful yet generic enough for any content provider to use topic space for our framework we need a collection of articles that capture a common feature distribution among most current news outlets We assume that this requirement is largely satisfied by articles published by the major UK media outlet BBC As such we use the BBC dataset which contains documents corresponding to articles published on BBC News from to Each story belongs to a topical area business entertainment politics sports tech We represent each document as a tf-idf vector and then use t-SNE to project the high dimensional features into a two-dimensional plane Figure Prominence As previously discussed each article has a certain prominence that is largely decided by the news editors Under our model each article tj T comes with a prominence attribute While might change over time as it will be discussed later each article has an initial article-prominence This is the extent to which editors promote an article on its rst day of publication Due to the lack of relevant literature we assume that follows a long-tail distribution Intuitively only few articles make the headlines most of the articles are either concentrated in the bottom of the webpage or are only accessible through searching At the same time articles of different topics are not promoted equally To address this our framework allows content providers to adjust the weights of each topic with regard to their initial prominence The weights are converted to the Cumulative Distribution Function and each value ordered from high to low is assigned to a topic without replacement With every news cycle the old articles prominence is typically adapted to make room for the new eg by moving them lower in the webpages layout Our model accommodates for this fact by adjusting the prominence at each iteration The collective effect of editorial cues and reader interest is that the readers interaction with each article decreases with time or as Chen et al describe it a news article is a life form with stages of birth growth decay and death A number of empirical works support Figure A scatter plot of the tf-idf feature vector for each BBC article projected on two dimensions our simulations topic space accompanied by the kernel density estimate KDE this observation Mitchell et al report that roughly and of the interactions with an article happen within the rst two and ve days of its publication respectively exponential decrease Wang et al present a slightly different picture where the user interest fades at a slower rate For the sake of simplicity our model assumes that the prominence at the day of the articles life is modeled with a linear function p x where p is the slope ie a -iteration lifespan Users We now focus on modeling the users that is their preferences and their behavior ie the process behind each user making a choice to read one or more articles while taking into account the user-specific requirements as described in section Preferences As previously discussed both the articles content and the readers preferences ie ideal article are represented as points on the topic space cf Section Under the FH model users preferences remain static no matter their purchase history In order to accommodate for evolving user-preferences we introduce a user-drift model After reading article tj a users likelihood to drift towards the articles position in the topic space is sampled from drifts towards tj i where is the Euclidean distance from reader to article tj controls the width of the bivariate normal around the user In practice controls the likelihood of the user drifting towards distant articles We sample from a uniform distribution re-effecting the assumption that readers vary with respect to their eagerness to evolve their reading preferences The user covers m distance towards the article We argue that m does not affect the direction of simulation results only the magnitude However a relatively small m eg allows us to get a higher-resolution view of the temporal dimension of the recommender effects User choice Our model assumes that prior to any choice each reader is aware of a limited number of articles per iteration In a scenario of no editorial priming readers are only aware of the items they seek out In such a case the reader-article awareness can be a function of solely their spatial relationship on the topic space To accommodate for article-prominence we adapt the original FH model such that the user awareness is sampled from aware of tj log where controls the users balance between prominent high lambda and neighboring low lambda articles that are modeled to be in a users awareness controls how the awareness fades in the readers proximity ie the width of the bivariate normal around readers position on the plane the choice for normal distribution comes from the original FH model controls how the awareness fades with respect to the prominence dimension We use a logarithmic function for the prominence decay as it agrees with the general long-tail pattern of user attention in news articles ie how the attention decays towards the bottom of a news webpage Fleder and Hosanagar adjust and to create an interpretable base case In contrast for a more realistic approximation of the user awareness we turn our attention to related empirical endings The works of Tewksbury and Mitchell et al indicate that each user is aware of at least two topics In our topic space bounded in the Euclidean distance between any pair of BBC articles follows a normal distribution Setting to creates an awareness radius of size around each user thus articles of two different topics are highly likely to fall into the users awareness Considering that the contribution in the awareness pool from readers proximity and editorial priming should be inverse proportional under allows us to set to At each iteration the readers decide to read a number of articles from their awareness pool FH uses a choice model based on multinomial logit a well-established practice in economics and marketing according to the authors Wi vi is the set of articles in the readers awareness pool and vi is the deterministic component to be discussed later The stochastic component is an iid random variable with extreme value distribution Without the stochastic component the readers would always select to read the articles closer to their preferences Variable is crucial since it controls the uncertainty in the users choice The higher the less readers deviate from their original preference-based article ranking and thus the more likely they are to select prominent or recommended articles Fleder and Hosanagar set to However no studies support a specific value for an online news context Nevertheless according to the report of Mitchell et al of the news interactions with the users main topic happen while getting news on another topic This roughly implies that the readers should deviate from their main topic of preference roughly one-third of the times To set according to these endings we rst generate a set of users placed on the topic space uniformly We then assign a main topic to each user by using the class prediction of a Gaussian Mixture Model trained on the projected BBC articles We additionally generate articles using the aforementioned For different values we then compute the choice for each user and count the articles whose topic disagrees with the users main topic in the top ve positions We nd that one-third of each users top ve articles are of different topic than the users main for Recommendations In a typical news environment the readers are recommended n articles via emails alerts or the designated website element at regular time intervals or after they have interacted with a number of articles For the sake of simplicity we assume that the recommendations are only updated at the beginning of each iteration The recommendations in our model have two effects First the articles are added to the users personal awareness pool While under FH this effect is permanent in a news context that is rarely the case considering the vast amount and short-term relevancy of articles As such we assume that the awareness effect of the recommendations holds for a single iteration Secondly assuming that recommendations carry a certain prominence the tj articles deterministic component as it relates to user vi where corresponds to a salience boost However not all recommended articles share the same prominence different spatial patterns can be used for arranging the recommendations Our model aims to accommodate for that fact For simplifying purposes similar to Vargas we assume a list-based arrangement and thus a positional-bias in the user choice ie a rank-based likelihood of an article being selected We take to be a function of the articles rank Z in the recommendation list We use a simple exponential function and as such with following the approach in Vargas Metrics While the simulation output can be analyzed from the point of view of different research questions SIREN focuses on the concept of diversity In our work we specifically focus on two types of diversity long-tail diversity and unexpectedness further explained below While a number diversity metrics have appeared in the literature over the years we focus on the work of Vargas since it offers a direct mapping between our diversity concepts of interest long-tail unexpectedness to well-formulated metrics Long-tail diversity In contrast to popularity-based recommendations long-tail diversity focuses on recommending items which are less popular and obvious choices In the context of news the possibility to integrate the long tail of topics has both commercial and normative benefits In the former case the under-presented stories can be highlighted thus providing a more stable distribution of readers In the latter case it allows integrating into the public agenda highly relevant topics which might be otherwise overlooked To measure long-tail discovery we use the Expected Popularity Complement metric is a user-oriented metric and takes into account the items rank relevance whether the user selected them and overall popularity In fact SIREN allows content providers to download the full extent of the simulation data and analyze it according to their needs Unexpectedness Unlike long-tail diversity which takes into account the interactions of all users with available content unexpectedness diversity focuses on the individual user activity This type of diversity refers to the possibility of locating a story which is unexpected but still useful for the reader The integration of unexpectedness in recommenders is known to increase user satisfaction and broaden user preferences by diversifying their interests From a normative point of view unexpectedness is integral for countering negative effects of over-fitting such as ideological/topical isolation resulting from filter bubbles/echo chambers For the unexpectedness diversity we use the Expected Prole Distance EPD metric which besides rank and relevance incorporates the content-based distance between items Technology Stack We now describe turning the simulation model into a simulation framework The frameworks main variables and modules in addition to the interactions between them is shown in Figure SIRENs implementation at each iteration takes as input the user the articles content T and prominence and the current reading history U T The user-awareness module cf Figure a rst computes the awareness pool of each user from the inputs The recommended articles for each user are then computed by passing the input to an external recommendation toolbox cf Figure b thus allowing for further extendability SIREN integrates the recommendation algorithms as they are provided by the toolbox MyMediaLite The algorithms cover a wide range of strategies from the simple random popular recommendations to the more sophisticated collaborative CF and content-based approaches After the recommended articles are integrated to the users awareness the user-choice module cf Figure c computes the selected articles Based on the users choice the final module in the pipeline deals with the temporal adaptations cf Figure d updating the users and the articles prominence The simulation model of SIREN is implemented in Python and is available online CASE STUDY SIREN allows content providers to instantiate the simulation with parameters specific to their values publishing habits and their readers behavior In order to showcase SIRENs benefits we investigate the recommender effects on a default generic instantiation that agrees with the major news outlets from the US for which a large amount of public data and studies are available The instantiation settings are summarized in Table In the next sections these settings will be justified followed by the analysis and results Articles Our instantiation considers T articles to be sampled from a Gaussian Mixture Model of ve components fitted on the overall BBC document population see section As a reminder we consider the BBC-based topic space to be generic enough to agree with most current news outlets including our US case study Regarding the number of articles published per day ie the number wwwmymedialitenet accessed August Open-sourced at githubcom/dbountouridis/siren Users/readers Articles History User awareness a Recommendations b User choice c User drift Temporal adaptations d Article prominence Preferences Content Prominence User-article interaction Figure The frameworks main variables and modules and the interactions between them over the course of one simulation iteration Bold arrows represent input/output flow while thin arrows represent update functions of articles available to the users per iteration Bell et al reveal that US outlets publish articles at different rates from to per day We consider an average scenario of articles per day and as such T d where d the total amount of iterations With regard to the initial article prominence in order to realistically distribute between topical areas we turn our attention to the News Coverage Dataset NCI comprising topic-annotations of the top-five most prominent articles appearing in twelve major US online outlets January to May The percentage of politics sports business entertainment and tech topic appearing in the headlines is and respectively These percentages translate to a distribution of the article-prominence across topics via the process described in Section Users We now turn our attention to the users/readers We are interested in active readers that is subscribed users that receive personalized recommendations and read more articles than casual readers Similar to Li et al we assume that a significant preference-evolution over time can happen only for active users Our instantiation considers the readers preferences or position in the topic space to be sampled from a uniform distribution thus assuming a scenario where the readers interest as a group is spread evenly across the topic space Such a distribution captures a community of readers unaffected by recommender effects Regarding the number of active users U while the amount of subscribed users for popular outlets is known the exact percentage of those who are genuinely active is not supported by any literature For the purposes of this case study we consider a scenario of active readers daily We now focus on instantiating the reading behavior According to the Kaleida report casual readers are on average exposed to articles per day We can assume that active readers are exposed to more articles as such we set the maximum size of awareness to wwwpewresearchorg accessed August surveykaleidacom/Kaleida-news-ecosystem-report-europe-pdf accessed August Table

per day/iteration per topic z see section Awareness initial article prominence per topic p Prominence decrease factor per iteration Regarding the awareness balance between sought out neighboring and prominent articles see Fleder and Hosanagar supported by marketing studies on online purchasing behavior set it to However the report of Mitchell et al indicates that an average of and of the articles are accessed through search engines and news websites respectively Thus of the total interactions without recommendations should happen due to the users proximity to the article and therefore Recommendations We now turn our attention to the recommender settings While the exact number n of recommended items varies from outlet to outlet we assume a generic scenario of n Regarding the recommender salience see section Mitchell et al indicate that roughly of the article interactions happen via email alerts which typically contain personalized recommendations the extent and type of which is unknown The analysis of Kille et al shows that roughly one out of user-article interactions happen due to in-article recommendations but similarly the recommendation strategy is unknown We adjust according to Mitchel et al as many of our models parameterizations are based on their report Given the current simulation instantiation for all algorithms from the MyMediaLite toolbox the average ratio of recommended reads to the rest sought out and prominent is for Analysis setup We ran the recommender systems simulations for d iterations as pilot experiments have indicated that it takes that amount of iterations for the simulation to converge In order to deal with the cold-start problem prior to the recommenders we run a control period of iterations with the recommendations and user-drift deactivated We take the users reading history from the control period as the initial input for the recommenders The rest of the interactions happen via social media email alerts etc Following on pilot experiments we select to investigate ve recommenders the exhibited interesting behavior the Random and MostPopular algorithms can be seen as baselines which recommend random and most popular articles respectively We also select two common collaborative filtering algorithms ItemKNN and UserKNN The item-based k-nearest neighbor algorithm ItemKNN recommends items from a set of similar articles for each of the articles that the user has read while UserKNN recommends items from the most similar users in terms of reading habits We also select a more sophisticated algorithm WeightedBPRMF which is an extension of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking BPR framework that aims to reduce the problem of learning to rank into binary classification based on Bayesian analysis Results Long-tail diversity Figure left presents the long-tail diversity over the course of the simulation Starting from the worst performing algorithms it is no surprise that MostPopular presents the worst performance on long-tail diversity since it focuses on popular items Interestingly the random recommender strategy is only slightly better than MostPopular While Random recommends articles from the long-tail the likelihood of users reading them is small thus the long-tail diversity is minimal The best performing algorithms are ItemKNN and WeightedBPRMF It is interesting that the simple ItemKNN outperforms the more sophisticated approach although WeightedBPRMF eventually converges to the same diversity as the number of iterations/days increases The reason behind ItemKNNs high performance becomes more clear if we consider Figure the position of users and articles on the topic space throughout the simulations length We observe that neither ItemKNN nor Most Popular that is used as a reference in Figure can prevent readers from concentrating around the topical centers However ItemKNN generates small clusters of users circled in red on the Figure that are distributed across a topic Figure Long-tail diversity left and unexpectedness diversity right over simulation iterations measured using the and EPD metrics respectively for ve MyMediaLite algorithms the error bars correspond to half the standard deviation for the sake of visual clarity The dotted lines correspond to the diversity of the algorithms over the same simulation but with the user-drift deactivated with no error bars for the sake of visual clarity thus allowing a wider range of the topic space to be explored In addition if we observe the drift lines in the same we can see that ItemKNN demonstrates a greater degree of user drift for those users with preferences not completely covered by the article selection ie users with initial position around the radius Returning to Figure another interesting case is UserKNN We observe that UserKNN gradually increases the long-tail diversity until it converges close to the top-ranked algorithms This behavior relates to the fact that the user preferences evolve the same simulation run with the user-drift deactivated dotted lines in Figure reveals that for static users UserKNN fails to show a behavior of increasing diversity Intuitively the more users are concentrated the more UserKNN can accurately identify similar users which in turn increases the likelihood of users reading a recommended item Unexpectedness diversity EPD We now turn our attention to the unexpectedness diversity measured using the EPD metric see Figure right At rst sight we observe the overall higher variance of EPD compared to ie for most algorithms users experience unexpectedness at different levels Looking closer we observe a similar behavior to the metric MostPopular and Random provide the least diversity while ItemKNN and WeightedBPRMF the most UserKNN starts at a diversity close to Random but eventually converges to a value close to the top-ranked algorithms Interestingly the unexpectedness seems to follow a downward slope for the top-ranked algorithms and Random This behavior again relates to the evolving user preferences A comparison with the diversity results with the user-drift deactivated dotted lines on the strongly indicate that the more users concentrate around the central topical areas the less unexpected the recommendations become Discussion Our analysis provides some interesting insights First the overall downward EPD slope and the increasing diversity suggest that the recommenders effects with respect to diversity are dependent on the evolution of the readers preferences While the temporal effect has been already known for other contexts our results suggest that such effects may extend to online news As such studying personalized news recommenders and their impact on the public sphere demands a focus on their temporal behavior Consequently we argue that studies based on snapshots of real-life data eg can only provide a short-term understanding of the recommender effects Secondly the overall difference with respect to both diversity metrics between the drift and non-drift simulations indicates that evolving user preferences can be either beneficial or unfavorable to certain recommendation strategies For example UserKNN is certainly benefitted while Random and MostPopular are hindered Even if the immediate effects of the recommender system do not lead to overall lack of diversity our two discussion points suggest that these effects can be influenced by the users changing preferences in a way that will have negative consequences for the public sphere such as societal polarization This implies that content-providers should aim to understand their users impulse to change preferences prior to adopting any algorithm Finally while the correspondence of the diversity metrics to the users perception remains an active challenge we observe that common collaborative filtering algorithms such as ItemKNN UserKNN can be more or similarly diverse both in terms of long-tail and unexpectedness to sophisticated alternatives ie WeightedBPRMF For ItemKNN its relatively strong performance is not surprising considering that a number of works eg by Lathia et al or Park et al already support it The case of UserKNN on the other hand is more surprising considering the lack of works supporting its diversity potential and requires further investigation Nevertheless for content providers interested in offering a personalized experience while sensitive to societal challenges such simple recommendation strategies can be valid candidates Figure The position of users/readers cross shapes and articles circular points on the topic space after iterations of the simulation run with the default settings for two algorithms ItemKNN left and MostPopular right The black lines track the user preferences over time aka the user-drift The size of the articles corresponds to the amount of reads they received normalized by the sum of all reads Their colors correspond to their topic label For the ItemKNN case for the sake of visual inspection a number of user clusters are circled in red For the MostPopular case the region of the ring with radius colored in light blue encapsulates a large number of users that failed to drift CONCLUSIONS We proposed and developed an online news consumption simulation framework SIREN that visualizes and analyzes the effects of recommender systems in order to help content providers decide better what algorithms to deploy In light of the widespread concerns about the societal effects of curating algorithms we argue that our focus helping content providers be more aware of the effects of different recommendation algorithms is an under-explored way to mitigate their potentially nefarious effects Nevertheless we should address the limitations of our approach Any simulation model is an approximation of reality which potentially misrepresents the complexity of the phenomenon in question In our case while evolving user preferences were considered we neglected the full complexity of editorial priming and the temporal news consumption patterns week days vs weekends among others While our model is largely based on literature endings certain components of reality were simplified while others were modeled based on intuition Yet our case studys endings conform with previous work on diversity in recommender systems giving support to the reliability of our frameworks conceptual model Despite the limitations our framework accounts for much of the complexity of news consumption in an online environment Moreover its strength comes from its easy extendability and potential integration of other features such as different metrics and recommendation algorithms At the same time SIREN allowed us to get a glimpse into the recommender effects in the context of US online news and provided valuable insights that would have remained obscured otherwise eg the temporal dimension of diversity or the diversity potential of common collaborative filtering techniques Finally future research with SIREN should accommodate for and explore the recommendation effects in different contexts such as different types of users We are also planning to engage in a discourse with content providers to further understand their needs and particularities SIREN will be regularly updated such that a number of urgent research questions can be readily answered
