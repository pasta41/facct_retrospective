24,dwork18a,Appendix A,"Transfer Learning Bounds We derive a closed-form solution for θ, the (approximately) optimal down-weighting of outgroup data for our transfer learning algorithm","This solution depends on a bound ∆ (defined in Theorem 8) on the difference in classifier ranking across different groups. For small ∆, the difference in error rates of each pair of classifiers is approximately the same for in-group and outgroup data. In this case, we expect generalization to work well and hence θ ≈ 1. For large ∆, outgroup data doesn’t provide much guidance for the optimal in-group classifier, and we expect θ ≈ 0. Finally, for a fixed k and θ ∈ [0, 1], let ĉ be a classifier that minimizes the empirical loss when out-of-group samples are down-weighted by θ, i.e., ĉ ∈ arg min c∈CkP nk ˆ̀ k(c) + θn−k ˆ̀−k(c), and c∗ be an optimal classifier that minimizes the true loss, i.e., c∗ ∈ arg min c∈CkP `k(c). We would like to choose θ such that `k(ĉ) is close to `k(c∗). In order to derive a closed-form solution for θ in terms of ∆, we use concentration bounds to bound the expected error rates of ĉ and c∗ in terms of ∆ and θ, and then choose θ to minimize this expression. Lemma 9 Fix any k ≤ K,P, nk, n−k ≥ 0 and ∆, θ ≥ 0. Let 〈xi, yi〉ni=1 be n = nk + n−k training examples drawn from D conditioned on exactly nk belonging to group k. Let ĉ ∈ arg minc∈CkP nk ˆ̀ k(c) + θn−k ˆ̀−k(c) be any minimizer of empirical error when the non-group-k examples have been down-weighted by θ. Then, Pr [ `k(ĉ) ≤ min c∈CkP `k(c) + f(θ, nk, n−k,∆, δ) ] ≥ 1−δ, where the probability is taken over the n = nk + n−k training iid samples, and f(θ, nk, n−k,∆, δ) is defined as: (√ 2(nk + θ2n−k) log 2|C| δ + θn−k∆ ) . (5) Unfortunately, the minimum value of f is a complicated algebraic quantity that is easy to compute but not easy to directly interpret. Instead, we can see that: Lemma 10 For f from Equation (5), g(nk, n−k,∆, δ) = minθ∈[0,1] f(θ, nk, n−k,∆, δ) is at most min √ 2 nk log 2|C| δ , √ log 2|C| δ + n−k n ∆  , (6) with equality if and only if nk ≥ 2 ∆2 log 2|C| δ in which case the minimum occurs at θ = 0 where g(nk, n−k,∆) = √ log 2|C| δ . Otherwise the minimum occurs at, θ∗ = √ β2 n−k nk (1− β)− β for β = ∆2 2 nk log(2|C|/δ). Appendix B.
