ABSTRACT
Algorithmic fairness aims to address the economic, moral, social,
and political impact that digital systems have on populations through
solutions that can be applied by service providers. Fairness frame-
works do so, in part, by mapping these problems to a narrow defi-
nition and assuming the service providers can be trusted to deploy
countermeasures. Not surprisingly, these decisions limit fairness
frameworks’ ability to capture a variety of harms caused by systems.
We characterize fairness limitations using concepts from require-
ments engineering and from social sciences. We show that the focus
on algorithms’ inputs and outputs misses harms that arise from
systems interacting with the world; that the focus on bias and
discrimination omits broader harms on populations and their envi-
ronments; and that relying on service providers excludes scenarios
where they are not cooperative or intentionally adversarial.
We propose Protective Optimization Technologies (POTs). POTs,
provide means for affected parties to address the negative impacts
of systems in the environment, expanding avenues for political con-
testation. POTs intervene from outside the system, do not require
service providers to cooperate, and can serve to correct, shift, or
expose harms that systems impose on populations and their envi-
ronments. We illustrate the potential and limitations of POTs in two
case studies: countering road congestion caused by traffic-beating
applications, and recalibrating credit scoring for loan applicants.

digital systems. Their ubiquity in our everyday activities raises con-
cerns regarding the centralization of decisional power [1]. These
concerns are amplified by the opaque and complex nature of these
systems which results in hard-to-explain outputs [2] and unjust
outcomes for historically marginalized populations [3–6].
Computer scientists counter these inequities through frame-
works studied under the rubric of fairness, using a variety of formal
fairness notions [7]. Their results have been instrumental in our un-
derstanding of the discriminatory effects of algorithmic decisions.
The frameworks, however, rely on narrowing the inequity problem
to primarily consider the discriminatory impact of algorithms, and
assuming trustworthy providers. The narrow view has enabled
valuable breakthroughs centered around the service providers’ abil-
ity to address some inequities, but fails to capture broader harms
or explore other ways to contest service-provider power [8].
In this work we investigate digital systems from a new perspec-
tive in order to understand how to address the broader class of
harms that they cause. To achieve this, we characterize the type of
systems in which algorithms are integrated and deployed. These
systems typically build on distributed service architectures and
incorporate real-time feedback from both users and third-party
service providers [9, 10]. This feedback is leveraged for a variety of
novel forms of optimization that are geared towards extraction of
value through the system. Typically, optimization is used for tech-
nical performance and minimizing costs, e.g., by optimizing cloud
usage orchestration or allocation of hardware resources. It has also
become part and parcel of “continuous development” strategies
based on experimentation that allow developers to define dynamic
objective functions and build adaptive systems. Businesses can now
design for “ideal” interactions and environments by optimizing
feature selection, behavioral outcomes, and planning that is in line
with a business growth strategy. We argue that optimization-based
systems are developed to capture and manipulate behavior and
environments for the extraction of value. As such, they introduce
broader risks and harms for users and environments beyond the
outcome of a single algorithm within that system. These impacts
go beyond the bias and discrimination stemming from algorithmic
outputs fairness frameworks consider.
Borrowing concepts and techniques from software and require-
ments engineering, and from economics and social sciences, we
characterize the limitations of current fairness approaches in cap-
turing and mitigating harms and risks arising from optimization.
Among others, we show that focusing on the algorithms and their
outputs overlooks the many ‘externalities’ caused by optimizing
every aspect of a system; that discrimination is only one of the in-
justices that can arise when systems are designed to maximize gain;
and that ignoring service providers’ incentives and capabilities to
enforce proposed solutions limits our understanding of their opera-
tion and further consolidates the power providers have regarding
decisions and behaviors that have profound effects in society.

Finally, we propose Protective Optimization Technologies (POTs),
which aim at addressing risks and harms that cannot be captured
from the fairness perspective and cannot be addressed without a
cooperative service provider. The ultimate goal of POTs is to elim-
inate the harms, or at least mitigate them. When these are not
possible, POTs can shift harms away from affected users or expose
abusive or non-social practices by service providers. We illustrate
the potential of POTs to address externalities of optimization-based
systems in two case studies: traffic-beating routing applications
and credit scoring. We also identify numerous techniques devel-
oped by researchers in the fields of security and privacy, by artists,
and by others, that, though not necessarily designed to counter
externalities, can be framed as POTs.
2 FAIRNESS FROM A SYSTEM’S PERSPECTIVE
We introduce Michael A. Jackson’s theory of requirements engi-
neering [11] to discuss the focus, goals, and assumptions behind
fairness framework from a systems’ perspective. This theory argues
that computer scientists and engineers “are concerned both with
the world, in which the machine serves a useful purpose, and with
the machine itself [...] The purpose of the machine [...] is located in
the world in which the machine is to be installed and used.” In other
words, our objective is to design systems that fulfill requirements
in the world where the system is to be deployed.
More precisely, a portion of the world becomes the environment,
or the application domain,∗ of a machine. In this world there are
phenomena in the application domain (e.g., events, behavior of
people, activities) and in the machine (e.g., data, algorithms, state).
The machine’s inputs and outputs, i.e., the things the machine can
sense or affect, are shared phenomena: they are observable both to
the application domain and the machine.
We introduce machines into existing application domains to ef-
fect change in these domains. To achieve the desired change, we
need descriptions of the phenomena before the machine is intro-
duced, known as domain assumptions 𝐾 ; and statements about the
desired situation once the machine is introduced to the domain,
known as requirements 𝑅. A specification 𝑆 is a set of requirements
providing enough information for engineers to implement the ma-
chine. 𝑆 typically describes phenomena shared between themachine
and application domain. A program 𝑃 derived from the specification
is a description of a machine. If implemented correctly, programs
satisfy the specification. If the specification is derived correctly,
programs generate phenomena that attain the desired effects in the
application domain, i.e., they fulfill the requirements.
Jackson’s explicit treatment of the application domain and its
interaction with the machine helps us to project known problems
with algorithms to a systems view. It enables us to distinguish
problems due to badly derived requirements (description of the
problem) from those due to badly derived specifications (description
of the solution) and those due to badly implemented programs (how
solutions are implemented) [12].
∗
Application domain does not refer to a class of applications, like health or banking
domain, but to actors and things in the environment where the machine is introduced.
2.1 The focus on algorithms is insufficient for
addressing inequitable outcomes of systems
In the light of Jackson’s theory, we claim that the focus on algorithms
leaves out the systems’ view. Algorithms are often a part of a larger
technical system, which is deployed in an environment. Fairness
proposals rarely evaluate the systems’ environmental conditions,
thereby leaving out the possibility that, even when a fairness metric
is satisfied by the algorithm, the system (environment plus the
machine) could still be unfair or have other negative side effects.
Such focus on the specification of the machine also promotes the
idea “that the difficulty in addressing [unfairness] lies in devising a
solution” [11] and not necessarily in rethinking the world.
Most fairness frameworks focus on describing 𝑆 independent of
𝐾 and 𝑅 and then guarantee that states of the machine, and its input
and outputs, have certain properties. However, a machine that has
fair inputs and outputs and fulfills a specification 𝑆fair does not
guarantee the fulfillment of requirements of fairness in the applica-
tion domain. This would require evaluating 𝐾 , establishing what
phenomena the machine is expected to change in the application
domain, and articulating requirements 𝑅fair with fairness as a goal.
Only then could we evaluate whether an 𝑆fair fulfills 𝑅fair.
Focusing on 𝑆fair has a number of repercussions. First, it does not
reflect how harms manifest themselves in the environment. Without
an understanding of𝐾 and 𝑅fair, a specification 𝑆fair may simply not
lead to a fair outcome. Imagine a hypothetical “fair predictive polic-
ing algorithm” that can fairly distribute police officers to different
neighborhoods. If the algorithm does not consider that the policing
institution is already configured to control minorities [13] and that
interactions with police pose greater risk of harms for minorities, a
“fair allocation” can still disparately impact those minorities [6].
Second, focusing on achieving fairness for users might leave out
the impact of the system on phenomena in the application domain that
is not shared with the machine. Unjust outcomes could arise due to
the optimization of certain behavior in the application domain, and
not because 𝑆 was unfair. For instance, self-regulated housing mar-
kets such as Airbnb [14] may not actively discriminate against their
users, but reports have shown that they can disrupt neighborhoods
by changing rent dynamics and neighborhood composition [15].
Third, the focus on algorithms abstracts away potential harms of
phenomena in the machine. Much of the fairness literature focuses
on ways in which algorithms can be biased or on harms caused by
decision-making algorithms. This overlooks that, when the system
hosting the algorithms optimizes its operation, it may gather more
inputs and outputs than those of the algorithm. Therefore, focusing
on the algorithm may miss effects on the world that can go beyond
those generated by the outputs of the algorithm actions.
When phenomena in the machine domain are subject to opti-
mization, unfairness can arise from optimization programs 𝑃opt
fulfilling the specification 𝑆fair but not the requirements 𝑅fair in the
application domain. For instance, prediction techniques to optimize
targeted advertising can create discriminatory effects [16]; and ex-
ploration strategies to optimize 𝑆fair may gather inputs from the
application domain that put some users unfairly at risk [17].

2.2 Discriminatory effects are not the only
concern for building just systems
In Jackson’s terms, considering only discriminatory effects con-
strains the requirements 𝑅fair to a particular class of harms. This
approach risksmissing other harms caused by the systemwhen evalu-
ating the performance of the specification 𝑆fair in the environment.
We assume the introduction of a machine in an environment
aims to improve specific phenomena. The fact that this machine
follows a specification 𝑆fair that does not discriminate according
to 𝑅fair does not guarantee that this machine will not induce other
harms to the environment in any applications domain. Take as
examples unsafe housing or bad working conditions. If we use a
machine to distribute these resources more efficiently, even if it
does so fairly, all users are harmed. Bad housing conditions and lack
of labor protection are problems in and of themselves so users will
be badly served regardless of fairness conditions. When the system
is by design unjust, or when the phenomena are structurally unjust
or harmful, claims on 𝑆fair are meaningless. In Jackson’s terms: the
requirements 𝑅 are incomplete with respect to just outcomes.
Sometimes, however, injustices are tightly tied to the machine:
𝑆 is not the solution but the source of problems. The way require-
ments 𝑅 are optimized might lead to externalities for (a subpopula-
tion of) users. When a specification 𝑆 optimizes an asocial outcome,
such as excessive user engagement in social networks [18], it can
expose users to harms like addiction. Solving fairness in this system
will not resolve the underlying problem: the system is harmful.
Striving to fulfill the requirements 𝑅fair itself might bring new
harms to the application domain. Consider a fairness solution that
alleviates distributional shift based on increasing diversity in the
training set. If its specification 𝑆fair requires collecting data from
more individuals or collects new attributes to implement the fair-
ness measure, it will exacerbate privacy issues. These issues might
result in many other harms in the application domain.
This ontology assumes that 𝑆 is built to “solve problems” and
“improve phenomena” in the world. Thus, it does not provide the
conceptual tools to address adverse situations. This positive valence
hinders the consideration of cases in which a machine amplifies
existing injustices or introduce new ones. Neither this ontology
nor fairness frameworks account for power imbalances or eco-
nomic incentives, and how they impact how machine requirements
are considered and prioritized. We consider these matters in the
next section by augmenting our systems view to consider socio-
economic aspects of the application domain.
3 FAIRNESS, INCENTIVES, AND POWER
In this section, we extend our analysis to problems related to the
political economy of systems. To model harms, we borrow the
term negative externalities from the economics literature. A system
causes negative externalities when its consumption, production,
and investment decisions cause significant repercussions to users,
non-users, or the environment [19]. The introduction of a machine
might cause externalities in the application domain, independent
of the completeness or correctness of its requirements and spec-
ification. For example, the heavy use of traffic-beating apps such
as Waze can worsen congestion for all drivers in the application
domain [20]. We argue that validating the specification 𝑆 against
the requirements 𝑅 is not enough. To build just systems one must
consider externalities of the machine in the application domain.
Congruent with models in fair optimization and economics, to
express externalities and incentives we introduce two utility func-
tions that capture the machine’s impact on the application domain:
the service provider’s utility, which measures how much value the
provider extracts from introducing the machine, and the social util-
ity, which measures the machine’s utility for the environment and
people. We define two versions of social utility: one with a “god’s
view” of the application domain and one from the specification’s
perspective. These utility functions enable us to capture injustices
due to the introduction of the machine into the environment.
3.1 Idealized Fair-by-Design Service Provider
We first consider an idealized fair-by-design service provider that
is willing to address the externalities of the machine. That is, this
provider aims to maximize both their own utility and the social
utility. Using this setting, we show the ways in which fairness
models fail to address a broad class of systems’ externalities.
We consider that a system is parametrized by a vector of internal
parameters \ ∈ Θ for some convex set of possible parameters Θ.
Let 𝑃 be a population, a set of individuals or other environmental
entities that might be affected by the system. Let 𝑈 (\ ) : Θ → R
be the utility function of the provider when they use parameters \ .
Let 𝐵(\ ) : Θ → R denote a hypothetical social-utility function, or
benefit, defined in the requirements 𝑅. Let ?̂?(\ ) be the social utility
in the provider’s specification. The provider optimizes its operation
by solving the following multi-objective optimization problem:
max
\ ∈Θ
{𝑈 (\ ), ?̂?(\ )} (1)
This problem is considered in fair learning literature in its scalarized
form or constraint-form [21–25], with the social utility modeling
a notion of fairness. We assume an ideal situation in which the
chosen parameter vector \∗ is a Pareto-optimal solution [26], that
is, it cannot improve any of the objectives without hurting at least
one of them. Pareto-optimality, however, is not sufficient to guaran-
tee fairness or equity as different trade-offs between the objectives
are possible [27]. We assume that out of the possible Pareto so-
lutions, the provider chooses one that maximizes social utility:
\∗ ≜ argmax\ ∈Θ∗ ?̂?(\ ), where Θ∗
is the set of all Pareto-optimal
solutions.
3.1.1 Limitations in the Face of Externalities. Consider \◦, the sys-
tem obtained when using the “god’s view” values of social utility:
\◦ ≜ argmax\ ∈Θ◦ 𝐵(\ ),withΘ◦
being the set of the corresponding
Pareto-optimal solutions when using 𝐵 in Eq. 1.
Let Δ𝐵 ≜ 𝐵(\∗) − 𝐵(\◦). We say that a system with parameters
\ induces externalities on its environment when the social utility
of \ is not equal to that of the system \◦: Δ𝐵 ≠ 0.
This definition is analogous to the neoclassical economic inter-
pretation of externalities: due to an “inefficiency,” a partial optimum
(\∗) is achieved, that is different from the optimum if no inefficien-
cies were present (\◦) [28]. One can also parallel the divergence
between social-utility values in Δ𝐵 to the Pigouvian “divergence of
social and private costs” [29]. Because we are analyzing harms, we
focus on negative externalities: Δ𝐵 < 0.

version (𝑈 , ?̂?). Misspecification of 𝐵 results in externalities
Δ𝐵, difference in values of the benefit function between
provider’s system 𝐵(\∗) and 𝐵(\◦).
Clearly, Δ𝐵 = 0 when 𝐵 = ?̂?. If 𝐵 does not precisely match ?̂?,
however, there will likely be externalities present, as illustrated in
Fig. 1. In general, it is not known how exactly Δ𝐵 is impacted by
deviations of ?̂? from 𝐵. In Appendix A, for a class of strictly concave
utility functions we show that the sensitivity of Δ𝐵 to infinitisemal
error of ?̂? is approximately quadratic in the magnitude of the error.
Intuitively, Δ𝐵 grows quadratically fast as ?̂? diverges.
Incomplete Information of Social Utilities. We first study the case
in which the provider’s view of the social utility, ?̂?, does not fully
reflect the requirements and the context of the application domain.
Social benefit is often modeled as a function incorporating in-
dividual models of social utility. A common assumption in neo-
classical economics is that social utility is the sum of individual
utilities [30]: ?̂?(\ ) = ∑
𝑖∈𝑃 ?̂?𝑖 (\ ), where ?̂?𝑖 : Θ → R is a utility of
individual 𝑖 ∈ 𝑃 . In practice, however, the fair-by-design provider
has incomplete information: they are aware of the users, yet lack
the full knowledge of their needs (similar to “imperfect knowledge”
in economics and game theory [31]). That is, they could misspec-
ify ?̂?𝑖 (\ ) ≠ 𝐵𝑖 (\ ) for some user 𝑖 ∈ 𝑃 , inadvertently ignoring the
needs and well-being of this individual. Consider a hypothetical
fair-by-design predictive policing [32] application that assumes that
?̂? is maximized when there is equality of false positives in patrol
dispatches across regions. The resulting dispatching rates might
be fair for this definition, but the overall social benefit 𝐵 might be
unchanged as minorities could still be over-policed in terms of the
number of dispatches.
Omitting Impact on Non-Users and Environmental Impact. Another
case is when the fair-by-design provider has structural lack of
knowledge of the application domain, e.g., knows the utility of
their users, but not the utility of anything else (i.e., of phenomena
not shared with the machine). Thus, a fair solution for the users
could harm non-users as their benefits were never specified in the
model ?̂?(\ ). This is exemplified in the case of self-regulating hous-
ing markets, which could hypothetically be optimized for fairness
in acceptance rates for guests [33], but disrupt neighborhoods im-
pacting housing conditions, especially for people with low incomes.
3.1.2 Limitations Under Complete Knowledge. Even in the pres-
ence of complete information regarding 𝑈 and 𝐵, there can exist
externalities that the provider cannot mitigate.
First, the provider can maximize 𝐵 and yet cause externalities if
the system’s goal itself is harmful [34]. For example, a facial recog-
nition surveillance system might be completely fair with respect to
skin color, but it still causes risks and harms to the population as a
whole in terms of privacy loss.
Second, the fair-by-design model has as premise that there exists
a solution \◦ that, if not maximizes, then at least satisfies minimum
standards of everyone’s benefit. However, this may not be the case.
Recall the examples about unsafe housing or bad jobs in Sec. 2.2. In
those cases, the fair outcome might still be harmful for all users.
3.2 Limitations on Ideals
Mitigating externalities becomes a greater issue when incentives,
capacities, and power structures are not aligned. One way this
manifests itself is in the modeling of social benefit as a function.
Indeed, a function cannot encode all the nuance regarding human
needs. Moreover, neither the provider nor the users’ utility func-
tions model the political context or the power asymmetries in the
environment of the machine [35]. These can heavily influence or
skew what we assume to be the ground truth 𝐵. Thus, power and
politics may come to render the system specification unfair even
when it was designed considering the perfect benefit function for
users.
Furthermore, the fairness-by-design approach inherently as-
sumes that the provider always has enough resources to implement
the fair solution that maximizes social utility. However, it is unrea-
sonable to believe that such an assumption will hold in practice. For
instance, even if Waze was cognizant of the needs of all individuals
and all the peculiarities in their streets, it is unlikely that they could
afford an operations in which all of those constraints are taken into
account or be capable of mitigating the impact of externalities due
to the interaction of multiple traffic beating applications.
Finally, not all service providers have the incentives to implement
fair-by-design solutions. The provider might not be incentivized to
care about social utility or could benefit from externalizing certain
costs. In such cases, the magnitude of the externalities Δ𝐵 is likely
to be more pronounced than in the case of incomplete knowledge.
4 PROTECTIVE OPTIMIZATION
TECHNOLOGIES
The systems view on algorithms in previous sections enables us to
systematically explore a problem space that had not been formal-
ized before. A major source of problems is the use of optimization
techniques that help to capture and manipulate phenomena in the
application domains for the extraction of value. This practice causes
intentional or unforeseen changes to the environment which result
in (often neglected) harms to the environment.
We showed that existing fairness frameworks produce solutions
that can only address a subset of these harms, at the discretion of
a service provider. These frameworks have limited capability to
mitigate harms arising from inequities inherent to the application
domain and from harmful impacts introduced by the machine. By
focusing solely on actions that can be taken by service providers,
who have opposite incentives, fairness frameworks narrow both
politics and contestation to the re-design of the algorithm which
may not always be the site of either the problem or the solution.

Figure 2: Uber: a complex optimization system. Inputs to
Uber optimization (black), effects on the environment (blue),
and alternatives to deploy POTs (red).
In this section, we discuss means to address these issues. Al-
though these means could be of socio-legal nature, we focus on
technological approaches that we call Protective Optimization Tech-
nologies (POTs). Their goal is to shape the application domain in
order to reconfigure the phenomena shared with the machine to
address harms in the environment. POTs are designed to be de-
ployed by actors affected by the optimization system. As these
actors directly experience the externalities, a) they have intimate
knowledge of the system’s negative effects, b) they are in position
to have a better view of their social utility than a system provider
can model—because it is their own utility [36]. Lastly, c) POTs do
not rely on the incentives of the provider.
POTs seek to equip individuals and collectives with tools to
counter or contest the externalities of the system. Their goal is not
to maximize benefits for both users and service providers, nor to
find the best strategy to enable optimization systems to extract value
at minimum damage. POTs are intended to eliminate the harms
induced by the optimization system, or at least mitigate them. In
other cases, POTsmay shift the harms to another part of the problem
space where the harm can be less damaging for the environment
or can be easier to deal with. Finally, when service providers react
to reduce the effectiveness of POTs, this very action exposes the
service providers’ need to maintain the power relationship and their
capability to manipulate the environment to their own benefit.
POTs and Optimization Systems. To extract value through optimiza-
tion, service providers obtain inputs from their environments that
help them make decisions. We consider three kinds of inputs: i)
inputs that users generate when interacting with the system, ii)
inputs about individuals and environments received from third par-
ties [37], and iii) inputs from regulations and markets that define
the political and economic context in which the system operates.
Note that third parties can be public or private, and the data they
provide can be gathered online or offline. We use Uber ride-hailing
service [38] as an example to showcase this complexity (Fig. 2).
In order to maximize its profit, Uber optimizes the prices offered
to riders and the wages offered to drivers. Uber uses the following
inputs (black arrows). First, it uses the direct inputs it receives from
both riders and drivers. Second, it uses data from other sources
such as online service providers, e.g., Google for maps and data
that they might collect using cookies or pixels on other sites their
users visit [39]. Uber also receives offline data from parties like
municipalities interested in promoting the use of Uber to reduce
costs of public transport [40]. Lastly, Uber uses inputs from the
market and regulators to evaluate the economic context in order to
adjust wages and ride prices.
Uber ultimately uses these inputs and all the political and eco-
nomic context in a combination of managerial and mathematical
optimization to deliver outcomes to the environment: match rid-
ers to drivers and set ride prices. Reports and studies demonstrate
that these outcomes cause externalities: Uber’s activity increases
congestion and misuse of bike lanes [41], increases pollution, and
decreases public support for transit [42, 43].
In the previous sections’ vocabulary, Uber and its optimization
techniques are the machine; and the application domain comprises
Uber drivers and riders, non-users, the online and offline environ-
ments, and the market and regulatory frameworks in which Uber
operates. Roughly speaking, Uber’s requirements 𝑅 are to match
drivers to riders with associated dynamic pricing. The specification
𝑆 defines what Uber applications should do to fulfill 𝑅.
Uber is known to have unfairness problems. For example, Rosen-
blat et al. show that customer-based reviews are biased against
minority drivers. As getting blocked from the system depends on
these reviews, even if the Uber’s algorithms do not discriminate
drivers on their attributes per se, the rules of the system result in
disparate impact on blocked drivers [44]. Further, even when Uber
algorithms are fair, e.g., they reward all drivers the same irrespective
of their protected attributes, the optimization processes underlying
Uber’s operation result in unjust outcomes: low wages [45]. The
former is an externality stemming from structural biases in the
application domain (thus a hypothetical 𝑆fair does not result on
𝑅fair); whereas the latter is a problem of incentives misalignment.
In the Uber scenario, POTs can be deployed by users and non-
users with the goal of changing the phenomena captured by Uber.
These can come in three forms (red lines in Fig. 2): by changing the
inputs of the users to the system (e.g. the surge-induction POT [46]
as we describe shortly in Sec. 4.1), by changing the online or offline
signals gathered by Uber (e.g., mayors changing the city urban
planning), or by affecting the market (e.g., by changing regulations
or mandating salary increases [44]).
4.1 Examples of POTs
Our vision for POTs systematizes the use of technologies as tools
to both explore the effects that algorithms and optimization sys-
tems have on our society, and the design of countermeasures to
contest their negative effects in the absence of regulatory or other
accountability measures.
We now revisit recent academic technologies, artistic interven-
tions, and deployed tools, that can be reframed as POTs (Table 1
provides a summary). POTs formalize such technologies and inter-
ventions, enabling the systematic study and design of such solutions.
We illustrate this in Sec. 5, where we design two POTs from scratch.
These technologies have different origins. First, we observe that
there are technologies proposed in the academia that can be re-
purposed as POTs. For instance, in the field of computer security,

tion system causing the externality and the desired outcome of the POT; deployment requirements (individual or cooperative
action); and the underlying design techniques (counter-optimization or heuristics to decide how to shape the environment).

research that aims to protect against attackers gaming the YouTube

bles; in the field of adversarial machine learning, tools developed to
evade copyright detection [48], originally developed to strengthen
DRM, can be reframed as a way to prevent fair-use takedowns [64].
Second, we draw from works produced by artists looking into the
impact of technology on society. For instance, counter-surveillance
fashion that tricks facial recognition technologies [62] can be re-
purposed to evade discriminatory facial recognition algorithms
or discriminatory uses of facial recognition. Finally, we look to
deployed technologies that are already countering optimization,
either intentionally or as a side effect. For instance, Jobscan [56]
assists job applicants in getting past the automated sorting imple-
mented by large companies and job-posting sites. This tool could
be repurposed to reduce the gender or racial bias reported for these
tools [65].
These examples can also be categorized based on the means
used to design the POT: those based relying on adversarial ma-
chine learning [47, 49–51, 56, 61], and those that use heuristics to
exploit the target optimization process. For instance, as a response
to low wages, Uber drivers have developed heuristics for inducing
surges [46].
Finally, some technologies can be deployed individually and oth-
ers require collective action. AdNauseam [54], for example, reduces
the utility of ad networks by clicking all ads served to the user, flood-
ing the network with false information. Without a critical mass of
users, however, AdNauseam’s effect would not be observable.
5 DESIGNING PROTECTIVE OPTIMIZATION
TECHNOLOGIES: CASE STUDIES
In this section, we show how, given an optimization system and a
negative externality, one can design new POTs from scratch.
Like many of the technologies and interventions in Table 1, we
make use of optimization techniques to design the operation of
POTs. Starting from the model introduced in Sec. 3, we model
the optimization system’s objective as a function 𝑈 (x;\ ) : X𝑚 ×
Θ → R, where X𝑚
denotes the space of environment inputs to
the system (i.e., phenomena that are sensed by the machine), and
the vector x ∈ X𝑚
is a set of inputs coming to the system. Each
concrete input 𝑥𝑖 can come from a different source (users, non-users,
or other actors in the environment). For simplicity, we model the
time dimension through discrete time steps, and we assume that
there are two possible time steps: 0 and 1.
To maximize its gain, the optimization system strives to solve a
mathematical optimization problem \∗𝑡 = argmax\ 𝑈 (x𝑡 ;\ ) for a
set of inputs x𝑡 at each point in time 𝑡 . Given this system, the
goal of a POT is finding actionable—feasible and inexpensive—
modifications to the inputs of the optimization system so as to
maximize social utility that we denote as 𝐵pot (\ ). Note that this
definition of social utility needs not to correspond to the social
utility considered by the optimization system (?̂?(\ ) in Section 3).
We consider that each input has an associated modification cost
𝐶 (𝑥𝑖 → 𝑥 ′
𝑖
) : X × X → R+, that represents how hard it is to
modify it. The cost of changing a set of inputs 𝐶 (x → x′) can be
any function of the individual costs.
In this model, we define the POT design as a bi-level multi-
objective optimization problem:
min
x′
{𝐶 (x → x′),−𝐵pot (\∗𝑡+1)}
s.t. \∗𝑡+1 = argmax
\𝑡+1
𝑈 (x′, \𝑡+1)
(2)
where x is the vector of inputs if no intervention happened, and x′
are possible vectors of modified inputs. \𝑡+1 represents the system’s
state in the next step, after the POT has been deployed through the
modified inputs x′.
We now instantiate this problem for two different use cases, one
where the POT can be deployed by an individual, and one where
effective deployment requires a collective.
5.1 Thwarting Traffic from Routing Apps
In our first case study, we look at Waze, a crowdsourced mobile
routing application that optimizes the routes of its users based
on information about traffic, road closures, etc. [66]. Waze causes
negative externalities for residents of towns and neighbourhoods
POTs: Protective Optimization Technologies FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain
that are adjacent to busy routes. For example, take the town of
Leonia, New Jersey, USA, which lies just outside one of the bridges
into New York City. As Waze rose in popularity and directed an
increasing amount of users through the town when the highway
was busy, the town became crowded during rush hours. To prevent
Waze traffic, the town was briefly closed off to non-local traffic,
which was determined illegal [67]. In this section we propose a
solution for discouraging Waze from selecting routes through the
town while minimizing the impact on its inhabitants.
Problem Setup. We set up this problem as a planning problem in
which the town’s traffic network is modeled as a weighted directed
graph, and the goal is to increase the cost of paths between the
highway ramps. We define Waze’s utility𝑈 as the capability to pro-
vide fastest routes for its users. Routing through town can increase
this utility when it takes less time than traveling via the highway.
The POT is designed to increase the minimum time through town
so that Waze users are not routed through it. We define the social
utility 𝐵pot as a binary variable that takes value 1 when no vehicle
is routed through the town (i.e., the cost in time of traversing the
town is greater than traversing the highway) and 0 otherwise.
Let G = (V,E, 𝑡) be a weighted directed graph representing the
traffic network within the town. Each edge (𝑥,𝑦) ∈ E ⊂ V × V
represents a road segment, and each vertex represents a junction of
segments. The edges have associated time to pass the segment given
by the function 𝑡 (𝑥,𝑦).We define the time cost of traversing a path in
the graph as the total time to pass its edges: 𝑡 (e) ≜ ∑
(𝑥,𝑦) ∈e 𝑡 (𝑥,𝑦).
Let 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ V be the source and sink vertices that represent the
entry to the town from the highway (𝑎), and the exit to return to
the highway (𝑏). Let the time to travel from point 𝑎 to 𝑏 via the
highway be 𝑡∗. While we do not know the routing algorithm used
by Waze, we assume that Waze will send users through the town
when the path through town is quicker than the highway. That is,
if there is a path e from 𝑎 to 𝑏 inG with cost 𝑡 (e) < 𝑡∗, Waze routes
users through the town.
5.1.1 Avoiding Routing via Planning. We aim to transform the
graph G into a graph G′
such that the time cost of any path e′
from 𝑎 to 𝑏 in G′
is 𝑡 (e′) ≥ 𝑡∗. We focus on what the town can
control: time to traverse a road segment. We express these changes
as the increase in time that it takes to traverse a segment, Δ𝑡 (𝑥,𝑦).
We abstract the exact method for adding time to the segment, which
could be changes to speed limits, traffic lights, stop signs, speed
bumps etc. We construct G′
by modifying the time values in the
original graphG: 𝑡 ′(𝑥,𝑦) = 𝑡 (𝑥,𝑦) +Δ𝑡 (𝑥,𝑦), where 𝑡 ′ is a function
representing the edge time in G′
.
We acknowledge that some roads are more costly to change
than others by associating a modification cost to every road. In
practice, this cost will be specified by the town. We use length
of a road segment as such a cost, capturing that changing longer
roads will likely have more impact on the town. Let ` (𝑥,𝑦) ∈
{0, 1} be binary interdiction variables that represent whether we
are modifying the edge (𝑥,𝑦) in graph G′
. To express the cost 𝐶 of
modifying a graphG intoG′
we use the followingmodification-cost
function:
∑
(𝑥,𝑦) ∈E 𝑐 (𝑥,𝑦) · ` (𝑥,𝑦), where 𝑐 : E → R+ represents
the cost of modifying the edge (𝑥,𝑦).
We now formalize the POT through posing the multi-objective
optimization problem in Eq. 2 in a constraint form: minimize 𝐶
subject to the 𝐵pot constraint, given that Waze is maximizing 𝑈 :
min
` ( ·) ∈{0,1}
∑
(𝑥,𝑦) ∈E
𝑐 (𝑥,𝑦) · ` (𝑥,𝑦)
s.t. 𝑡 (e) ≥ 𝑡∗ for any path e from 𝑎 to 𝑏
(3)
This is equivalent to the problem known as shortest-path network
interdiction [68–71]. In the form equivalent to ours it can be solved
as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) [70, 71]. We refer to
Appendix B for the exact formulation of the MILP in our context.
We use ortools [72] for specifying this MILP in Python, and the
CBC open-source solver [73] for solving.
5.1.2 Empirical Evaluation. We apply this POT to three towns, all
of which reported issues with Waze: Leonia, NJ, USA; Lieusaint,
France; and Fremont, CA, USA. We retrieve the map data for each
via the Open Street Maps API [74].
To assign 𝑡 (𝑥,𝑦) to each segment (𝑥,𝑦), we estimate the time it
takes to traverse the segment using its length and type (e.g., we
consider residential streets to have a speed of 25mph) and add extra
time for traversing the intersection. We infer the intersection time
using the travel time from Google Maps for accuracy. For each
city, we run the solver for different 𝑡∗ values, corresponding to
different travel times on the highway. Larger values of 𝑡∗ require
more changes to roads in the town.
Figure 3: Solutions for Leonia, NJ (left) and Lieusaint, France
(right), when the time of road segments is allowed to be in-
creased by 75%. Town streets are marked in blue, highways
in orange, and surroundings in grey. The red dots signify 𝑎
and 𝑏, the closest points to the highway in the town. The
roadsmarked by thick, black lines are the optimal set of seg-
ments in which the time should be increased.
For simplicity of implementation, we choose two points at the
edge of the town (red dots in Fig. 3) and not the sink/source points,
which would be on the highway, for the solver.We then add the time
that it takes to travel from the actual source point on highway to the
first point and from the second point back to the sink point in order
the calculate the results. For Leonia, for instance, we approximated
this as 30 seconds on each side of the town.
We consider scenarios in which the town is able to increase the
time that it takes to traverse each road segment by 25%, 50%, and
75%. For each town we found the value of 𝑡∗ for which Waze begins
sending cars through the town and the value of 𝑡∗ in which no
further changes to the road can prevent Waze from sending its
users through the town.
FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain Bogdan Kulynych, Rebekah Overdorf, Carmela Troncoso, and Seda Gürses
The graph for Leonia, NJ contains 251 vertices and 661 edges.
Given the parameters we choose, without any changes to the town,
Waze begins to send its users through Leonia when 𝑡∗ = 4.0. That
is, it normally takes 4 minutes to travel through Leonia, so when it
takes longer than 4 minutes to traverse the highway, Waze routes
users through town. This corresponds to traffic traveling at about
31mph on the highway. If we limit the amount of time that can
be added to traverse a road segment to 25% of the original time,
we can prevent cars from being routed through Leonia until the
average highway speed has reached 26mph (𝑡∗ = 5.1). That is, we
can find a solution that prevents routing through town as long as
the highway speed is greater than 26mph. For 75% time increase,
we can change the town such that traffic will not be routed through
Leonia until the average speed on the highway has fallen to 19mph.
This solution for Leonia is shown in Figure 3.
Lieusaint is larger than Leonia, with 645 vertices and 1,248 edges.
Given the parameters we choose, Waze routes its users through
Lieusaint when 𝑡∗ = 7.0, which corresponds to the speed on the
highway dropping to 16mph. Allowing the road segments to be
lowered by 75%, we can prevent traffic from being routed through
Lieusaint until the highway speed has dropped below 10mph (𝑡∗ =
12.0) (See Lieusaint in Figure 3). We report the solution for Fremont,
CA, a significantly larger town, in Appendix B.
Finally, we measure the cost of implementing these solutions
(Fig. 4). For each town, we consider the impact to the town to be
how much longer, on average, it takes to travel between any two
points in town. We compute the shortest path between every pair
of points in the town and average these times before and after
the POT solution. We then compute the percentage increase from
the initial average time to the post-POT average time. The higher
impact solutions are those which will tolerate a lower highway
speed. That is, they will prevent cars from being routed through the
town at lower highway speeds. We see that even though allowing
road segments to take 75% longer to traverse can prevent cars from
entering the town at a lower highway speed, the impact to the town
is much higher. The inhabitants of Lieusaint also suffer more from
the changes than the residents of the much smaller Leonia.
5.1.3 POT Impact and Limitations. The intervention we propose in
this section focuses on alleviating the problems routing applications
cause in one town. The POT would support this town’s government
to decide which changes should be implemented in the city layout
and traffic rules so that the cost of traversing the city becomes
undesirable for passthrough drivers. While this intervention indeed
mitigates the effect of external traffic on the target town, it is likely
that then vehicles are routed elsewhere, i.e., the POT shifts the
harms from this particular town to other regions. Moreover, we
acknowledge that our POT can only help in cases when vehicles can
still circulate on the highway. The moment the congestion forces
vehicles to halt, the town becomes the better option regardless of
any modification on its road network.
5.2 Reducing False Negatives in Credit Scoring

effects of a machine-learning credit scoring system: A system that a
bank uses to decide how to price a loan application according to

decisions are designed to maximize banks’ profits and minimize
their risks. These algorithms can be discriminatory [75], or cause
feedback loops for populations disadvantaged by the financial sys-
tem [76]. These harms are often caused by inputs that represent
unjust realities which are propagated to the model’s decisions.
Problem Setup.We model the credit scoring system as a classifier
𝑓\ (𝑥) that takes as input the information about the loan applicant
and the loan details, 𝑥 , and outputs a confidence score for whether
the applicant would repay the loan or not. This function optimizes
the bank’s utility that we model here as the negative empirical loss
over historical data: \∗ ≜ argmin\ ∈Θ
∑
(𝑥,𝑦) ∈𝑋 𝐿(𝑥,𝑦;\ ), where \
is the parameters of the classifier, 𝐿 is the loss function, and 𝑋 is
the bank’s dataset of historical loans (𝑥) and their repayment or
default outcomes (𝑦). We assume that the classifier is retrained as
new data points arrive.
In our case study, we model the harms of the system as the
rate of false negatives (wrong default predictions) for economically
disadvantaged populations. In this POT, we counter this problem
using adversarial machine learning techniques deployed by a col-
lective of individuals𝐺pot with the means to take and repay loans,
as explained shortly. This POT aims to increase the social utility de-
fined as the loss for a target group𝐺 : 𝐵pot (\ ) ≜
∑
(𝑥,𝑦) ∈𝐺 𝐿(𝑥,𝑦;\ ),
where𝐺 is the disadvantaged subset of applicants (in this case study,
we define disadvantaged as having little funds in the bank account)
who were wrongfully denied a loan. This POT can be thought as
promoting equality of false-negative rates between the target group
and everyone else [77, 78], with the difference that we do not limit
our view of externalities to a commonly protected subgroup, i.e.,
economical disadvantage is not commonly considered as protected.

5.2.1 Reducing False Negatives with Adversarial Machine Learning.
We first identify what inputs (x in the abstract model) can be modi-
fied by the collective 𝐺pot deploying the POT. First, the deployers
can only add new inputs to the dataset by taking and repaying
loans. Second, the demographic attributes of these added loan ap-
plications have to be similar to those of individuals in 𝐺 . Thus, the
POTmust inform the collective𝐺pot about who and for which loans
they should apply for and repay, in such a way that they reduce
the false-negative rate on the target group after retraining. This
POT is idealistic in that it assumes that this collective will include
applicants of diverse backgrounds to be able to provide different
inputs to the classifier. However, in the absence of other means of
feedback, communication, and accountability, it represents the only
means to influence an unjust system. It is also consistent with the
existing practices people resort to in this setting [79, 80].
Findingwhich inputs to inject into a training dataset tomodify its
outputs is known as poisoning in adversarial machine learning [81].
Typically, poisoning attacks aim to increase the average error of
the classifier or increase the error on specific inputs [82]. We note
that our use of poisoning is different. First, we poison to decrease
the error for a given target group. Second, our use of poisoning is
not adversarial. On the contrary, we use it to protect users against
harmful effects of the model.
With this in mind, we design the POT using the following bi-level
optimization problem:
min 𝐽 (\∗) =
∑
(𝑥,𝑦) ∈𝐺
𝐿(𝑥,𝑦;\∗) + _𝑅(\∗)
s.t. \∗ = argmin
\ ∈Θ
∑
(𝑥,𝑦) ∈𝑋∪𝑋pot
𝐿(𝑥,𝑦;\ )
𝑓\ ′ (𝑥) = ‘accept’ for all (𝑥,𝑦) ∈ 𝑋pot
𝑋pot ⊂ 𝑋pool, |𝑋pot | ≤ 𝑛
where \ ′ is the current parameters of the classifier, 𝑋pot is the set
of poisoned applications, 𝑛 is the maximum number of poisoned
applications, and 𝑋pool is a set of feasible loan applications. That
is, we minimize the classifier’s loss for the target group, where
the classifier \∗ is trained using the poisoned examples 𝑋pot. In
our evaluation below, we additionally make use of a regularizer
𝑅 to minimize the effect of poisoning on any other applications:
𝑅(\ ) ≜ −∑
𝑥,𝑦∈𝑋 𝐿(𝑥, 𝑓 (𝑥);\ ) .
This formulation makes two assumptions. First, we assume that
when designing the POT we have access to the training dataset of
the provider 𝑋 , and we can obtain retrained loan-approval models.
We consider this assumption reasonable as poisoning attacks tend
to transfer even if the dataset and model do not match the real ones,
especially when the models have low complexity [83]. Second, the
added loan applications must be feasible: there has to exist a person
in the 𝐺pot with demographics required for this loan application.
We solve this problem by scoring each example in𝑋pool according
to the value of our optimization objective 𝐽 (\∗), retraining \∗ for
each example, and then employing a greedy algorithm to assemble
𝑋pot that satisfies the constraints. We refer to the Appendix C for
the details of the algorithm.

Learning Repository [84]. This dataset contains 1,000 feature vec-
tors representing loan applications, including applicants’ job type,
bank account details, gender, etc., and loan details: amount, dura-
tion, and purpose. Each has a binary label encoding whether the
loan was repaid (70%) or not (30%). We implement the loan approval
system as a logistic regression classifier. For our simulation, we
split the dataset into the bank’s training dataset 𝑋 (800 examples),
and the test set (200). The classifier achieves 75.5% test accuracy.
We obtained the best results with the use of _ = 0.5 as the trade-off
parameter for the regularization term (out of 0.25, 0.5, 0.1) in 𝐽 (\∗).
We simulate the set of feasible applications𝑋pool using a subset of
successfully repaid applications from users that are not in the target
group by generating all possible changes of modifiable attributes.
We evaluate our POT in two settings: a “clean” setting in which
the only applications received by the bank are those from the col-
lective (𝑋 ∪ 𝑋pot); and a “noisy” setting in which other people take
loans between the time when the POT is deployed and the time
when the classifier is retrained. We report the results in the noisy
setting for 10 and 50 additional loans (1.25% and 6.25% of the origi-
nal dataset, respectively). We repeat the noisy experiments 10 times
in which we draw the “noise” loan applications at random.
We present the effect of poisoning on the target group and ev-
eryone else in Fig. 5, top. Unsurprisingly, the more poisoning appli-
cations there are, the more significant the effect. With 10 poisoning
applications (1.25% of the training dataset), our algorithm reduces
the number of false negatives in the target group by 9; in the pres-
ence of noise this decreases to 7. The false negatives in the rest of
the dataset are on average not impacted by our POT.
5.2.3 POT Impact and Limitations. Unfortunately, the POT increases
the false positives (Fig. 5, bottom). That is, it shifts the harm to the
bank, which would give more loans to people who cannot repay,
increasing its risk. This effect sharply increases with the seventh
FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain Bogdan Kulynych, Rebekah Overdorf, Carmela Troncoso, and Seda Gürses
application (out of 10). This is due to the poisoning inputs starting
to change the model parameter corresponding to the loan purpose.
In turn, this increase in false positives could lead to adverse social
impact over time if banks try to counter the POT effect [85]. The
POT deployers could adjust the trade-off parameter _ to control for
the side-effects. Yet, such a reaction would expose the incentives
and motivations behind the bank’s choice of parameters.
To be consistent with the fairness literature [77, 86], we assume
that the target group is interested in getting higher credit ratings
(through decrease in false-negatives). This model that postulates
the access to credit as beneficial, however, is naïve. Even though the
loan-making process that relies on risk-based pricing has economic
backing, by definition it implies that the less finanically advantaged
people will get more expensive loans. Hence, an intervention that
aims at increasing inclusion of disadvantaged populations in the
lending process can be seen as an instance of predatory inclusion [76,
87, 88]. Even if it results in lower loan prices in the short term, it
can lead to dispossession in the long run. When harms are viewed
through this lens, It is not clear if any technological intervention is
capable of counteracting such systems.
6 DISCUSSION
Our inspiration to provide a more holistic view on optimization
systems and their harms comes from works that point to the logic
and potential impact of optimization systems. In particular, Poon
has drawn attention to the ways in which optimization systems are
driven by outcomes, as exemplified in our utility functions in Sec. 3.
This allows for techniques like operational control and statistical
management to be the primary mode with which machines interact
with phenomena in the world [76]. As a result, these techniques
function both as a means for engineering and as “a mathematical
state that poses as a solution to political contention” [89]. Opti-
mization is a technique long established in, for example, resource
allocation. However, its increasing supremacy in systems that re-
configure every aspect of life (education, care, health, love, work
etc.) for extraction of value is new and refashions all social, political,
and governance questions into economic ones. This shift allows
companies to commodify aspects of life in a way that conflates hard
questions around resource allocation with maximization of profit
and management of risk [90]. The impact is subtle but fundamental,
as evident in the way even we start framing complex and historical
questions of justice in terms of utility functions.
To ground ourselves in the world, we used the requirements
engineering model of Michael A. Jackson, aligning it with calls for
decentering technology and centering communities in the design
of systems [91]. We extended the model to ensure that we are not
suggesting that problems and solutions are neatly separable and
void of power and political economy [92]. However, many elements
that might be crucial for conceptualizing optimization systems are
still missing. The ontology offers few concepts to capture matters
around data, machine learning, or services, and it does not pro-
vide deeper insights into addressing issues like fairness or justice.
It is, however, a nod to the importance of ontological work for
systematizing reflections on our frameworks [93, 94].
To capture the political economy of optimization systems, we
turned to utilitarian models and calculations of externalities. Such
models are commonly used both in mathematical and managerial
forms of optimization and are the cornerstone of neoclassical eco-
nomics. However, utilitarianmodels have been thoroughly critiqued
for, among others, perpetuating inequalities [35]. Most prominently,
Sen has highlighted the limitations of assessing value through con-
sequences, assessing value through subjective utility, maximizing
welfare without regard for its distribution, and fetishizing resources
over relations between resources and people [95]. Overall, utilitar-
ian approaches are weak in capturing collective interests, social
well-being, forms of power, and subjugation. Given these critiques,
the central role that these models play in designing large-scale
optimization systems is a problem in and of itself.
One possible way forward is to consider alternative economic
models for the design and evaluation of systems, e.g., [35, 96–98].
POTs depend and build on the existence of such alternative eco-
nomic models and the availability of collectivity, altruism and reci-
procity. They assume there is something to be gained both indi-
vidually and collectively, dismissing the selfish agents presumed
in utilitarian approaches. In fact, we struggled to express POTs in
the utilitarian logic: if we optimize for the utility of the service
provider it is hard to justify any POT that may reduce the utility of
the service provider.
Beyond economic gains, POTs strategically support people’s
agency. Optimization systems offer little agency to effectively con-
test their value proposition [75, 99–101] and offer more optimiza-
tion as solutions for externalities [102]. POTs can be used to exercise
some agency towards an unaccountable [103] and “authoritative
system” [104]. Nevertheless, service providers may argue that POTs
are gaming the system. Our focus is on social-justice contexts,
in which POTs can be cast as “weapons of the geek” for the least
equipped to deal with the consequences of optimization [105]. POTs
can also serve to expose systems’ injustices, achieving transparency
and accountability goals. In that sense, they also can come to act
like rhetorical software “that turn the logic of a system against it-
self [...] to demonstrate its pathology” [106]. This includes making
apparent the damaging results of utilitarian forms of governance
prominent in optimization systems.
Despite their positive potential, designing and deploying POTs
is not trivial. By virtue of modifying, subverting, or sabotaging
an optimization system, POTs may elicit transitions in the system
state that result in externalities. If several POTs are deployed and
enter in an arms race, those agents with the most knowledge and
resources are likely to deploy the most aggressive and effective
POTs and have the most leverage. This undermines the ability of
less powerful populations, who may need POTs the most, to have
any effect on the system. This signals that well-thought POTs must
be built to provide less powerful actors with the means to respond
to the potential abuse of power by those that have more capabilities.
Just as much, the multi-input form of most optimization systems
poses a serious challenge: when optimization is based on continu-
ous tracking across many channels, POTs cannot be built short of
creating “optimized doubles” of entities in the environments [107].
The fact that a whole infrastructure for optimizing populations and
environments is built in a way that minimizes their ability to object
to or contest the use of their inputs for optimization is of great
concern to the authors—and should be also to anyone who believes
in choice, subjectivity, and democratic forms of governance.
