ABSTRACT	
There	 is	 a	growing	attention	on	 the	notion	of	 fairness	 in	 the	
GDPR	in	the	European	legal	literature.	However,	the	principle	
of	fairness	in	the	Data	Protection	framework	is	still	ambiguous	
and	 uncertain,	 as	 computer	 science	 literature	 and	
interpretative	guidelines	reveal.		
This	paper	looks	for	a	better	understanding	of	the	concept	of	
fairness	 in	 the	 data	 protection	 Pield	 through	 two	 parallel	
methodological	 tools:	 linguistic	 comparison	 and	 contextual	
interpretation.	
In	 terms	 of	 linguistic	 comparison,	 the	 paper	 analyses	 all	
translations	of	 the	world	“fair”	 in	the	GDPR	in	the	EU	ofPicial	
languages,	 as	 the	 CJEU	 suggests	 in	 CILFIT	 Case	 for	 the	
interpretation	of	the	EU	law.		
The	 analysis	 takes	 into	 account	 also	 the	 translation	 of	 the	
notion	of	fairness	in	other	contiguous	Pields	(e.g.	at	Article	8	of	
the	EU	Charter	of	fundamental	rights	or	in	the	Consumer	Pield,	
e.g.	 Unfair	 terms	 directive	 or	 Unfair	 commercial	 practice	
directive).	
In	 general,	 the	 notion	 of	 fairness	 is	 translated	 with	 several	
different	 nuances	 (in	 accordance	 or	 in	 discordance	with	 the	
previous	 Data	 protection	 Directive	 and	with	 Article	 8	 of	 the	
Charter)	
In	some	versions	different	words	are	used	interchangeably	(it	
is	the	case	of	French,	Spanish	and	Portuguese	texts),	 in	other	
versions	 there	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 speciPic	 rationale	 for	 using	
different	terms	in	different	parts	of	the	GDPR	(it	is	the	case	of	
German	and	Greek	version).	
The	analysis	reveals	three	mean	semantic	notions:	correctness	
(Italian,	 Swedish,	 Romanian),	 loyalty	 (French,	 Spanish,	
Portuguese	and	the	German	version	of	“Treu	und	Glaube”)	and	
equitability	(French,	Spanish	and	Portuguese).	
Interestingly,	 these	 three	 notions	 have	 common	 roots	 in	 the	
Western	legal	history:	the	Roman	law	notion	of	“bona	Pide”.	
Taking	into	account	both	the	value	of	“bona	Pide”	in	the	current	
European	legal	contexts	and	also	a	contextual	interpretation	of	
the	role	of	fairness	in	the	GDPR,	the	preliminary	conclusions	is	
that	 fairness	 refers	 to	 a	 substantial	 balancing	 of	 interests	
among	data	controllers	and	data	subjects.		
The	approach	of	fairness	is	effect-based:	what	is	relevant	is	not	
the	 formal	 respect	 of	 procedures	 (in	 terms	 of	 transparency,	
lawfulness	or	accountability),	but	the	substantial	mitigation	of	
unfair	imbalances	that	create	situations	of	“vulnerability”.	
Building	 on	 these	 rePlections,	 the	 paper	 analyses	 how	 the	
notion	 of	 fairness	 and	 imbalance	 are	 related	 to	 the	 idea	 of	
vulnerability,	within	and	beyond	the	GDPR.	
In	sum,	the	article	suggests	that	the	best	interpretation	of	the	
fairness	principles	 in	the	GDPR	(taking	 into	account	both	the	
notion	 of	 procedural	 fairness	 and	 of	 fair	 balancing)	 is	 the	
mitigation	 of	 data	 subjects’	 vulnerabilities	 through	 speciPic	
safeguards	and	measures.

1	 	Introduction	
There	 is	a	growing	attention	on	the	notion	of	Fairness	 in	the	
Data	Protection	 framework	and	 in	 the	algorithmic	regulation	
discourse.	 However,	 the	 principle	 of	 fairness	 in	 the	 Data	
Protection	framework	is	still	ambiguous	and	uncertain,	[1]	as	
computer	 science	 literature	 and	 interpretative	 guidelines	
reveal.	
The	lack	of	a	clear	interpretation	of	fairness	concept	in	the	FAT	
discourse	 can	 probably	 be	 solved	 through	 two	 parallel	
methodological	 tools:	 linguistic	 comparison	 and	 contextual	
interpretation.	 In	 terms	 of	 linguistic	 comparison,	 this	 paper	
analyses	all	translations	of	the	world	“fair”	in	the	GDPR	in	the	
EU	official	languages,	as	the	European	Court	of	Justice	requires	
for	the	interpretation	of	the	EU	law.		
	
 
 
Section	2	addresses	the	notion	of	fairness	in	the	context	of	the	
GDPR,	 while	 section	 3	 observes	 how	 the	 European	 Court	 of	
Justice	 addressed	 the	 concept	 of	 fairness	 in	 data	 protection.	
Then,	 Section	 4	 analysed	 Data	 Protection	 Authorities’	
understanding	 of	 fairness	 (in	 particular	 the	 French	 and	 the	
English	 one),	 while	 Section	 5	 has	 addressed	 a	 linguistic	
comparison	 of	 the	 term	 fairness	 in	 different	 European	
languages.	The	 linguistic	 analysis	 takes	 into	account	 also	 the	
translation	of	the	notion	of	fairness	in	other	contiguous	fields	
(e.g.	at	Article	8	of	the	EU	Charter	of	fundamental	rights	or	in	
the	 Consumer	 field,	 e.g.	 Unfair	 terms	 directive	 or	 Unfair	
commercial	 practice	 directive).	 In	 general,	 the	 notion	 of	
fairness	 is	 translated	 with	 several	 different	 nuances	 (in	
accordance	or	in	discordance	with	the	previous	Data	protection	
Directive	and	with	Article	8	of	the	Charter).	
The	analysis	 in	 this	paper	shows	that	approach	of	 fairness	 is	
effect-based:	 what	 is	 relevant	 is	 not	 the	 formal	 respect	 of	
procedures	 (in	 terms	 of	 transparency,	 lawfulness	 or	
accountability),	 but	 the	 substantial	 mitigation	 of	 unfair	
imbalances	that	create	situations	of	“vulnerability”.	
2 	Fairness	in	the	GDPR	
The	principle	of	fairness	is	introduced	at	article	5(1)	point	(a)	
of	the	GDPR	as	one	of	the	main	principles	of	data	processing,	in	
conjunction	with	lawfulness	and	transparency.	Potentially,	the	
notion	 of	 fairness	 could	 help	 prevent	 unfair	 imbalances	
between	 data	 subjects	 and	 data	 controllers,	 but	 the	 proper	
meaning	of	 the	 fairness	principle	 in	 the	GDPR	 is	 still	unclear	
and	vague.	
2.1 History	of	fairness	concept	in	the	Data	
Protection	framework	before	the	GDPR	
To	understand	the	meaning	and	usefulness	of	fairness	we	need	
to	understand	the	origins	of	the	fairness	principle	and	its	future	
developments.	The	notion	of	fairness	has	always	been	present	
in	 the	 data	 protection	 framework,	 since	 the	 very	 first	
international	 documents.	 The	 very	 first	 Council	 of	 Europe	
Resolutions	(1973	and	1974)	referred	to	fair	collection	of	data	
and	 unfair	 discrimination.[2]	 The	 1980	 OECD	 guidelines	 on	
data	 processing	 also	 mentioned	 “lawful	 and	 fair	 data	
processing”	of	personal	data.	Analogously,	the	1981	Council	of	
Europe	Convention	108	at	Article	5	stated	that	“personal	data	
undergoing	 automatic	 processing	 shall	 be:	 a)	 obtained	 and	
processed	 fairly	 and	 lawfully”.[3]	 Subsequently,	 the	 Data	
Protection	Directive	already	adopted	the	principle	of	fairness	
in	data	protection	at	Article	6(1)	lett.	a	(“personal	data	must	be	
processed	fairly	and	lawfully”)	and	recital	28	(“any	processing	
of	 personal	 data	 must	 be	 lawful	 and	 fair	 to	 the	 individuals	
concerned”).	
In	all	the	aforementioned	provisions,	“fairness”	is	mentioned	in	
conjunction	 with	 “lawfulness”	 as	 two	 inherently	 connected	
principles.	 However,	 in	 several	 other	 provisions	 fairness	 is	
linked	 to	 transparency	duties.	Articles	10	and	11	of	 the	Data	
Protection	 Directive	 clarified	 that	 in	 addition	 to	 the	
information	 about	 the	 identity	 of	 data	 controllers	 and	 the	
purposes	for	data	processing,	the	data	subject	should	receive	
also	other	information	“in	so	far	as	such	further	information	is	
necessary,	having	regard	to	the	specific	circumstances	in	which	
the	data	are	collected,	to	guarantee	fair	processing	in	respect	of	
the	data	subject”	(emphasis	added).	
Also	 Recital	 38	 confirmed	 the	 link	 between	 fairness	 and	
transparency:	 “if	 the	processing	of	data	 is	 to	be	 fair,	 the	data	
subject	 must	 be	 in	 a	 position	 to	 learn	 of	 the	 existence	 of	 a	
processing	operation	and,	where	data	are	collected	from	him,	
must	be	given	accurate	and	full	 information,	bearing	 in	mind	
the	circumstances	of	the	collection”	(emphasis	added).	
The	 distinction	 between	 mere	 transparency	 and	 fairness	 is	
probably	based	on	the	references	to	specific	“circumstances”	of	
the	data	processing	at	stake.	If	transparency	(e.g.	at	Articles	10	
and	 11)	 is	 mainly	 based	 on	 specific	 formal	 procedures	 to	
respect	in	terms	of	information	disclosure,	‘fair	transparency’	
takes	 into	 account	 substantial	 interests	 at	 stake	 in	 a	 specific	
data	processing	(and	the	eventual	need	to	communicate	more	
information	 to	 the	data	 subject).	 In	other	words,	 in	 the	Data	
Protection	 Directive,	 while	 the	 mere	 notion	 of	 transparency	
adopts	 a	 formalistic-procedural	 approach,	 the	 notion	 of	
fairness	applied	to	transparency	required	a	substantial	effect-
based	 approach:	 what	 matters	 is	 not	 that	 data	 controllers’	
duties	are	(formally)	respected,	but	that	the	data	subjects	(in	
practical	circumstances)	is	concretely	“in	a	position	to	learn	of	
the	existence”	and	of	the	details	of	data	processing	concerning	
him	or	her.	
The	principle	of	fairness	in	data	processing	is	also	mentioned	
in	the	EU	Charter	of	Fundamental	Rights.	Article	8	(1)	and	(2)	
state	as	follows:	“1.	Everyone	has	the	right	to	the	protection	of	
personal	 data	 concerning	 him	 or	 her.	 2.	 Such	 data	 must	 be	
processed	fairly	for	specified	purposes	and	on	the	basis	of	the	
consent	of	the	person	concerned	or	some	other	legitimate	basis	
laid	down	by	law.	Everyone	has	the	right	of	access	to	data	which	
has	been	collected	concerning	him	or	her,	and	the	right	to	have	
it	rectified”	(emphasis	added).	
The	 legislator	 of	 the	 Charter	 had	 in	 mind	 the	 principle	 of	
fairness	of	the	Data	Protection	Directive	and	its	interpretation	
should	be	linked	to	the	general	interpretation	of	secondary	law	
(the	directive	and	now	the	GDPR)	[4,5].	
2.2 		Fairness	in	the	GDPR:	the	two	nuances,	i.e.	
transparency	and	lawfulness	
	
Compared	to	 the	aforementioned	 legal	 texts,	 the	GDPR	is	 the	
legal	text	with	the	highest	number	of	references	to	“fairness”.	
Article	5(1)	lett.	a)	(rephrasing	Article	6	of	the	Data	Protection	
Directive)	mentions	fairness	as	the	first	principle	of	personal	
data	 processing,	 together	with	 lawfulness	 and	 transparency.	
The	strong	link	with	lawfulness	and	transparency	is	evident:	the	
three	 different	 principles	 are	 mentioned	 together,	 as	 three	
interdependent	notions.	
	
 
This	double	link	of	fairness	(with	lawfulness	and	transparency)	
is	 confirmed	also	at	 recital	39,	which	 first	declares	 that	 “any	
processing	 of	 personal	 data	 should	 be	 lawful	 and	 fair”	
(emphasis	 added),	 and	 then	 affirms	 that	 the	 transparency	
principle	 “concerns,	 in	 particular,	 information	 to	 the	 data	
subjects	on	the	identity	of	the	controller	and	the	purposes	of	
the	 processing	 and	 further	 information	 to	 ensure	 fair	 and	
transparent	processing”	(emphasis	added).	
The	other	references	to	‘fairness’	in	the	GDPR	are	either	related	
to	 the	 link	 between	 fairness	 and	 lawfulness	 or	 to	 the	 link	
between	fairness	and	transparency.	
	
2.2.1 Fairness as transparency in the GDPR. As	 regards	
transparency,	Articles	13(2)	and	14(2)	(similar	to	Articles	10	
and	 11	 of	 the	 Data	 Protection	 Directive)	 foresee	 that	 data	
controllers,	 in	addition	to	some	basic	 information	about	data	
processing	(identity	of	the	controller,	contact	details,	purposes,	
etc.),	 need	 to	 disclose	 to	 the	 data	 subject	 some	 additional	
information	 (e.g.	 storage	 periods,	 data	 subjects’	 rights,	 etc.)	
“necessary	to	ensure	fair	and	transparent	processing	in	respect	
of	the	data	subject”(emphasis	added).	
What	 makes	 processing	 not	 only	 transparent	 but	 also	 fairly	
transparent	is	that	the	data	subject	has	an	actual	knowledge	of	
the	 data	 processing	 concerning	 him	 or	 her	 and	 of	 its	 main	
characteristics	 (see	 recital	 60,	 rephrasing	 recital	 38	 of	 the	
Directive).		
The	 link	 between	 transparency	 and	 fairness	 is	 also	 rapidly	
confirmed	 at	 Article	 40(2)	 about	 code	 of	 conducts.	 “Code	 of	
conducts”	are	self-regulatory	and	voluntary	tools	required	to	
specify	the	application	of	the	GDPR	such	as	with	regards	to	fair	
and	transparent	processing	(see	also	recital	45:	of	the	GDPR).	
Lastly,	 recital	 71	 also	 mentions	 fairness	 in	 connection	 with	
transparency,	but	under	a	new	perspective:	“in	order	to	ensure	
fair	and	transparent	processing	in	respect	of	the	data	subject,	
taking	 into	account	the	specific	circumstances	and	context	 in	
which	 the	personal	data	are	processed,	 the	controller	should	
(…)	 implement	 technical	 and	 organizational	 measures	
appropriate	 to”	 prevent	 errors	 and	 inaccuracies	 taking	 into	
account	“potential	risks	involved	for	the	interests	and	rights	of	
the	 data	 subject”,	 such	 as	 discrimination	 (e.g.	 based	 on	
sensitive	data).	Here	 for	 the	 first	 time,	 fairness	 is	not	merely	
linked	 to	 substantial	 transparency,	 but	 to	 the	 organizational	
measures	for	the	prevention	of	any	adverse	effect	to	“interests	
and	 rights”	 of	 the	 data	 subject,	 including	 discrimination.	 If	
Articles	13	and	14	reveal	only	that	the	notion	of	fairness	should	
give	 a	 “substantial”	 approach	 to	 transparency	 duties	
(considering	specific	circumstances	and	effective	awareness	of	
the	data	subject),	recital	71	gives	a	new	additional	perspective:	
fairness	should	be	(also)	aimed	at	preventing	significant	effects	
of	 the	 algorithmic-driven	 environment	 on	 individuals	 (e.g.	
discriminatory	biases).	We	will	address	the	idea	of	fairness	as	
non-discrimination	in	a	specific	section	below.	
	
2.2.2 Fairness as lawfulness in the GDPR.	 As	 regards	 the	 link	
between	 fairness	 and	 lawfulness,	 we	 need	 to	 analyze	 first	
Article	6	(whose	title	is	“lawfulness	of	processing”).	Article	6(2)	
foresees	that	Member	States	may	maintain	or	introduce	more	
specific	 provisions	 in	 relation	 to	 data	 processing	 for	 legal	
obligations	(Article	6(1)	lett.	c)	or	for	public	tasks	(Article	6(1)	
lett.	e).	 In	 these	cases,	Member	States	can	determine	specific	
requirements	for	the	processing	and	other	measures	to	ensure	
lawful	 and	 fair	 processing	 including	 for	 other	 specific	
processing	situations	as	provided	for	in	Chapter	IX	of	the	GDPR.	
As	 aforementioned,	 the	 concept	of	 fairness	 is	 often	 linked	 to	
specific	circumstances	and	practical	cases	(“specific	processing	
situations”).	 In	addition,	 the	reference	 to	 “Chapter	 IX”	 is	also	
noteworthy:	 Chapter	 IX	 of	 the	 GDPR	 (Arts.	 85-91)	 refers	 to	
particular	cases	of	conflicting	interests	which	the	protection	of	
personal	 data	 could	 affect	 (freedom	 of	 expression	 and	
information,	public	access	to	official	documents,	archiving	and	
research	 purposes,	 freedom	 of	 religious	 entities	 to	 process	
personal	data)	or	sensitive	areas	in	which	national	legislations	
could	 be	 very	 different	 (e.g.,	 national	 identification	 number,	
employment	 law).	 Therefore,	 Article	 6(2)-(3)	 suggests	 that	
Member	States,	when	adopting	measures	to	ensure	lawful	and	
fair	processing	(within	legislations	permitting	data	processing	
on	the	basis	of	legal	obligations	or	public	tasks),	should	take	as	
an	 example	 the	balancing	 provisions	 at	 Chapter	 IX.	 It	 seems	
clear	 that	 the	 reference	 to	 fairness	 here	 should	 also	 be	
understood	 as	 fair	 substantial	 balancing	 between	 conflicting	
interests.	
A	further	reference	to	fairness	in	the	GDPR	is	recital	129:	Data	
Protection	 Authorities	 should	 exercise	 their	 powers	
“impartially,	 fairly	 and	 within	 a	 reasonable	 time”.	 Here	 the	
notion	of	‘fair’	is	different	from	the	principle	of	fairness	in	data	
processing	at	Article	5.	Nonetheless,	comparing	the	use	of	the	
same	word	in	one	legal	text	but	in	different	contexts	might	be	a	
useful	exercise	to	interpret	the	real	meaning	of	legal	notions.[5]	
The	link	between	fairness	and	impartiality	at	recital	129	might	
be	a	 further	element	revealing	 the	 link	between	 fairness	and	
non-discrimination,	as	we	will	show	infra	at	Section	2.4.1.	
2.3		Possible	meanings	of	fairness	in	the	GDPR	
After	this	first	overview,	it	seems	clear	that	fairness	cannot	be	
reduced	to	a	synonym	of	transparency	or	lawfulness,	but	has	
an	 independent	 meaning.	 That	 specific	 meaning	 can	 have	
different	 nuances	 if	 it	 is	 combined	 with	 the	 transparency	
principle	or	with	the	lawfulness	principle.	
The	 notion	 of	 fairness	 in	 the	 GDPR	 seems	 to	 refer	 to	 a	
substantial	 approach,	 aimed	 at	 preventing	 adverse	 effects	 in	
concrete	 circumstances	 situations,	 in	 particular	 when	
conflicting	interests	need	to	be	balanced.	
However,	the	idea	of	fairness	can	have	many	possible	nuances:	
non-discrimination,	 fair	 balancing,	 procedural	 fairness,	 bona	
fide,	etc.	
	
	
 
 
2.3.1 Fairness	as	contextual	implementation	of	transparency	and	
lawfulness:	 procedural	 fairness.	 As	 we	 have	 observed	 in	
Paragraph	2.2,	fairness	in	the	GDPR	is	always	associated	either	
to	transparency	or	to	lawfulness.	In	this	Section	we	will	analyse	
how	the	notion	of	fairness	has	been	developed	(even	by	Article	
29	 Working	 Party)	 in	 these	 two	 different	 fields.	 The	 three	
concepts	 of	 fairness,	 transparency	 and	 lawfulness	 are	
mentioned	together	in	Article	5(1)	lett.	a)	and	in	the	following	
provisions	 fairness	 is	either	associated	 to	 transparency	or	 to	
lawfulness	in	“specific	situations”,	“circumstances”.	
As	we	show	below,	sometimes	even	the	translation	of	the	world	
“fairness”	in	some	EU	language	overlaps	with	the	translation	of	
the	world	“lawfulness”,	in	particular	in	the	EU	Charter	at	Article	
8	[See	in	table	1,	below,	the	Greek	and	Swedish	translation	of	
the	world	fairness	at	Article	8	of	the	EU	Charter].	Moreover,	in	
some	 EU	 languages	 fair	 is	 translated	 in	 two	 different	 ways,	
depending	 on	 whether	 it	 is	 associated	 to	 lawfulness	 or	 to	
transparency.	 For	 instance,	 the	German	 version	 of	 the	GDPR	
has	two	different	terms	for	fairness:	“Treu	und	Glaube”	is	used	
when	 fairness	 is	associated	 to	 lawfulness	and	“Faire”	 is	used	
when	 fairness	 is	 associated	 to	 transparency.	 The	 first	 one	
recalls	 the	 notion	 of	 “good	 faith”,	 while	 the	 latter	 is	 more	
related	 to	 the	proper	English	 concept	of	 fair,	 loyal,	 equitable	
(see	infra,	§5.3).	
Also	Article	29	Working	Party	tends	to	associate	the	concept	of	
fairness	either	to	lawfulness	or	to	transparency.	This	is	clear	in	
two	different	opinions:	WP29	Opinion	on	Consent	and	WP29	
Opinion	on	Transparency.		As	regards	the	link	between	fair	and	
lawful,	 WP29	 Opinion	 on	 Consent	 clarifies	 that	 the	 fairness	
principle	 imposes	 an	 attentive	 evaluation	 (and	
communication)	 of	 the	 lawful	 basis	 for	 data	 processing:	 e.g.,	
sending	 out	 the	message	 that	 data	will	 be	 processed	 on	 the	
basis	of	consent,	while	actually	some	other	lawful	basis	is	relied	
on,	 would	 be	 fundamentally	 unfair	 to	 individuals.[7]	 Also,	
basing	personal	data	processing	on	the	consent	of	data	subject	
does	not	allow	the	collection	of	data	which	“is	not	necessary	in	
relation	to	a	specified	purpose	of	processing”	and	this	would	
“be	fundamentally	unfair”.[7]	
As	 regards	 the	 relation	 between	 fair	 and	 transparent,	WP29	
Opinion	on	Transparency	often	refers	to	fairness.	In	particular	
fair	 transparency	 seems	 to	 require	 additional	 efforts	 if	
compared	 to	merely	 formal	 transparency,	 since	 it	 takes	 into	
account	also	“reasonable	expectations”	of	data	subjects.	Fairly	
transparent	data	processing	means	expectable	and	foreseeable	
data	processing[8]	even	“consider[ing]	the	circumstances	and	
context	of	each	situation”[8].	We	can	make	an	example	of	the	
difference	between	formal	transparency	and	fair	transparency.	
While	 Articles	 13(1)	 lett.	 e	 and	 14(1)	 lett.	 d	 states	 that	 in	
principle	 data	 controllers	 should	 communicate	 merely	 the	
“categories”	of	data	recipients,	the	fairness	principle	 imposes	
something	 more:	 to	 “provide	 information	 on	 the	 actual	
(named)	 recipients	 of	 the	 personal	 data”[8]	 and	 if	 the	
controller	decides	to	disclose	just	the	categories	of	recipients	
she	would	be	asked	to	“demonstrate”	why	in	that	case	it	was	
fair	not	 to	disclose	 the	name	of	 recipients.[8]	As	we	show	 in	
paragraph	X,	also	the	European	Court	of	Justice	has	reaffirmed	
the	notion	of	procedural	fairness	as	disclosure	of	personal	data	
recipients,	 in	 particular	 in	 the	 public	 sector.[9,10,11,12]	
Similarly,	the	fairness	principle	imposes	the	data	controller	to	
explicitly	mention	all	third	countries	to	which	the	data	will	be	
transferred.[8]	
According	 to	WP29,	 the	notion	of	 fairness	 is	 also	 relevant	 in	
case	of	further	processing	of	personal	data.	Indeed,	the	fairness	
principle	imposes	that	the	more	intrusive	(or	less	expected)	the	
new	data	processing	is,	the	earlier	the	data	subjects	should	be	
informed	in	advance.[8]	In	case	the	data	controller	processes	
data	for	further	purposes	in	compliance	with	the	compatibility	
test	at	Article	6(4),	“essential	requisites	of	accountability	and	
fairness	under	the	GDPR”	would	impose	“that	data	controllers	
should	provide	data	subjects	with	further	information	on	the	
compatibility	analysis	carried	out	under	Article	6.4”.[8]	
All	 these	 practical	 examples	 of	 fairly	 transparent	 and	 fairly	
lawful	data	processing	are	forms	of	what	Clifford	and	Ausloos	
name	“procedural	fairness”.[5]	
	
2.3.2	 Fairness	 as	 fair	 balancing	 (based	 on	 procedural	
fairness).	Analyzing	the	GDPR	provisions,	Clifford	and	Ausloos	
notice	 that	 that	 the	 notion	 of	 fairness	 (combined	 both	 to	
transparency	and	 lawfulness)	 can	have	 two	main	 concurring	
interpretations:	fair	balancing	and	procedural	fairness.[5]	Fair	
balancing	 is	 based	 on	 proportionality	 between	 interests	 and	
necessity	 of	 purposes,	while	 procedural	 fairness	 is	 based	 on	
transparency	 duties,	 timeliness	 and	 burden	 of	 care	 of	 data	
controllers.[5]	
The	notion	of	fair	balancing	comes	from	several	provisions	in	
the	 GDPR.	 As	 aforementioned,	 Article	 6(2)-(3)	 refers	 to	
measures	 to	 ensure	 (lawful	 and)	 fair	 processing	 of	 personal	
data	 in	 specific	 processing	 situations,	 such	 as	 the	 cases	
described	 at	 Chapter	 IX	 GDPR,	 which	 regulates	 complex	
balancing	 between	 conflicting	 interests,	 e.g.	 freedom	 of	
expression	 and	 information	 (Article	 85),	 public	 access	 to	
official	 documents	 (Article	 86),	 archiving	 and	 research	
purposes	(Article	89),	freedom	of	religious	entities	to	process	
personal	data	(Article	91).	
The	 idea	 of	 fairness	 as	 fair	 balancing	 between	 conflicting	
interests	is	also	confirmed	in	the	jurisprudence	of	the	European	
Court	of	Justice	as	we	will	see	in	the	following	Section.	
At	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 GDPR	 usually	 relates	 the	 notion	 of	
fairness	to	specific	“measures”(Article	6(2)	and	(3),	recital	45),	
“procedures”	(recital	71)	or	information	duties	(Arts.	13(2)	and	
14(2),	 recitals	 39	 and	 60)	 that	 the	 data	 controller	 needs	 to	
adopt.	 That	 is	why	Clifford	 and	Ausloos	 refer	 to	 “procedural	
fairness”[5]:	 fairness	 should	 be	 practically	 implemented	
through	 specific	 procedures	 that	 can	 improve	 the	 level	 of	
transparency	and	lawfulness	of	a	certain	data	processing	in	a	
specific	context.	
Actually,	the	GDPR	does	not	always	describe	in	details	such	fair	
procedures:	 the	data	controller	 is	asked	to	choose	and	adopt	
	
 
her	own	procedures	in	order	to	make	a	data	processing	“fairly	
transparent”	 and	 “fairly	 lawful”,	 in	 particular	 looking	 at	 the	
“specific	circumstances	and	context	in	which	the	personal	data	
are	processed”	(recital	60	and	71)	or	the	“specific	processing	
situations”(Article	6(2)	and	(3)).	
In	other	words,	the	difference	between	“mere”	transparency	or	
lawfulness	 and	 “fair”	 transparency	 or	 lawfulness	 is	 the	
adoption	of	additional	safeguards	that	can	effectively	rebalance	
the	 unfair	 imbalance	 between	 the	 data	 controller	 and	 the	
subject	 in	 specific	 circumstances.	 For	 this	 reason,	 it	 seems	
reasonable	 to	 affirm	 that	 the	 two	 components	 of	 fairness	
(procedures	and	balancing)	are	not	separate	but	connected	as	
means	to	ends:	procedural	fairness	tends	to	fair	balance.	
In	other	words,	procedural	fairness	might	be	an	obligation	of	
results	rather	than	an	obligation	of	means:	the	data	controller	
is	not	asked	to	merely	apply	specific	measures,	but	to	reach	a	
fair	 substantial	 balancing	 between	 interests	 in	 specific	
situations.	 Actually,	 some	 scholars	 argued	 that	 fairness	 at	
Articles	5	and	6	GDPR	is	an	“ex	ante”	assessment	on	the	average	
data	subjects,	while	data	subject	rights	such	as	right	to	object	
and	erasure	(Articles	17	and	21)	are	based	on	an	“ex	post”	idea	
of	fairness,	tailored	on	specific	circumstances	[5].	
The	 dualism	 of	 fairness	 as	 procedural	 fairness	 and	 fair	
balancing	 has	 been	 recently	 adopted	 also	 in	 the	 Council	 of	
Europe	Modernized	Convention	108.[13]	
On	the	one	hand	Article	5(4)	states:	“personal	data	undergoing	
processing	 shall	 be:	 processed	 fairly	 and	 in	 a	 transparent	
manner”	(emphasis	added).	On	the	other	hand,	the	same	article	
at	paragraph	1	affirms:	“data	processing	shall	be	proportionate	
in	relation	to	the	legitimate	purpose	pursued	and	reflect	at	all	
stages	 of	 the	 processing	 a	 fair	 balance	 between	 all	 interests	
concerned,	 whether	 public	 or	 private,	 and	 the	 rights	 and	
freedoms	at	stake”	(emphasis	added).	
The	relationship	between	fairness	and	 interests	 is	not	new	in	
the	legal	discourse:	Bygrave	in	his	interpretations	of	the	Data	
Protection	 Directive	 related	 the	 notion	 of	 fairness	 to	 the	
consideration	of	interest	and	expectations	of	data	subjects.[14]	
As	we	will	show	in	Section	5.3,	the	link	between	fairness	and	
real	interests	of	the	individuals	is	in	line	with	the	western	legal	
history	of	the	notion	of	fairness/loyalty.	
The	 Explanatory	 Memorandum	 of	 the	 CoE	 Modernized	
Convention	 also	 takes	 into	 account	 a	 notion	 of	 fairness	 as	
respect	of	expectations	of	data	subjects,	 in	particular	when	it	
connects	 the	 idea	 of	 fairness	 to	 predictability	 and	 legal	
certainty.[15]	 	 The	Explanatory	Memorandum	also	mentions	
fairness	in	the	balancing	with	the	interests	of	law	enforcement	
authorities	 processing	 data	 under	 a	 necessity	 and	
proportionality	principle.[15]	
In	sum,	in	these	first	sections	we	observed	how	the	notion	of	
fairness	in	the	EU	Data	Protection	framework	is	related	to	the	
notion	 of	 significant	 imbalance	 between	 companies	 (data	
controllers)	 and	 individuals	 (data	 subjects).	 Fairness	 in	 the	
GDPR	 is	 linked	 both	 to	 transparency	 and	 to	 lawfulness:	 the	
principles	of	 fair	 transparency	and	 fair	 lawfulness	 impose	 to	
the	data	controller	adopting	specific	“procedures”	in	order	to	
reach	a	fair	balancing	between	different	interests.	
2.4. Fairness	as	non-discrimination	
	
The	 notion	 of	 fairness	 is	 also	 often	 interpreted	 as	 non-
discrimination,	in	particular	in	the	FAT	discourse	[16,17,	18].	
Indeed,	Oxford	English	Dictionary	defines	 “fair”	as	 “impartial	
and	 just	 treatment	 or	 behaviour	 without	 favouritism	 or	
discrimination”	(emphasis	added).	
The	relation	between	discrimination	and	(un)fairness	can	be	
found	 also	 in	 the	 very	 first	 international	 documents	 on	 data	
protection.	In	particular,	both	Resolutions	of	Council	of	Europe	
on	the	protection	of	privacy	 in	electronic	data	banks	refer	 to	
“unfair	discrimination”.[2]	
While	 in	 the	Data	Protection	Directive	 there	 is	no	direct	 link	
between	fairness	and	non-discrimination,	the	GDPR	seems	to	
refer	 to	 the	 link	 between	 fairness	 and	 discrimination.	 In	
particular,	recital	71	affirms	that	“in	order	to	ensure	fair	and	
transparent	 processing	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 data	 subject,	 the	
controller	 should	use	appropriate	mathematical	or	 statistical	
procedures	 for	 the	 profiling,	 implement	 technical	 and	
organizational	 measures	 appropriate	 to”	 prevent	 “potential	
risks”	for	the	interests	and	rights	of	the	data	subject,	such	as	
“discriminatory	effects	on	natural	persons	on	the	basis	of	racial	
or	 ethnic	 origin,	 political	 opinion,	 religion	 or	 beliefs,	 trade	
union	 membership,	 genetic	 or	 health	 status	 or	 sexual	
orientation,	or	 that	result	 in	measures	having	such	an	effect”	
(emphasis	added).	
Similarly,	WP29,	in	its	Opinion	on	Automated	Decision-Making,	
also	associates	unfairness	to	discrimination:	“Profiling	may	be	
unfair	 and	 create	 discrimination,	 for	 example	 by	 denying	
people	 access	 to	 employment	 opportunities,	 credit	 or	
insurance,	 or	 targeting	 them	with	 excessively	 risky	 or	 costly	
financial	 products”.	 In	 particular,	 WP29	 makes	 also	 one	
examples	of	“cases	which	would	not	meet	the	requirements	of	
Article	5(1)(a),	 illustrat[ing]	how	unfair	profiling	 can	 lead	 to	
some	 consumers	 being	 offered	 less	 attractive	 deals	 than	
others”:	 the	case	of	a	data	broker	selling	consumers’	profiles	
(based	on	consumers’	scoring)	to	financial	companies	for	the	
offer	of	“non-traditional”	financial	services	[19].	On	the	other	
hand,	Recital	129	 links	 “fairness”	 to	 “impartiality”,	 a	 concept	
close	 to	 non-discrimination	 in	 particular	 in	 the	 public	
sector.[20]	
The	CNIL	 (the	French	Data	Protection	Authority)	 in	 a	 recent	
report	 on	 Algorithms	 and	 AI	 has	 concluded	 that	 “a	 fair	
algorithm	 should	 not	 end	 up	 generating,	 replicating	 or	
aggravating	any	form	of	discrimination”[21].	
The	 interpretation	 of	 fairness	 as	 non-discrimination	 is	 not	
common	just	in	the	EU	framework	but,	e.g.,	even	to	other	extra-
EU	comprehensive	Data	Protection	frameworks.	In	particular,	
the	 Brazilian	 General	 Data	 Protection	 Law	 (Dispõe	 sobre	 a	
proteção	de	dados	pessoais	e	altera	a	Lei	nº	12.965,	de	23	de	
abril	 de	 2014	 (Marco	 Civil	 da	 Internet))	 takes	 largely	
inspiration	 from	 the	 GDPR.[22]	 Article	 6	 enlists	 all	 data	
	
 
 
protection	 principles	 (necessity,	 finality,	 adequacy,	
transparency,	 accountability,	 integrity,	 etc.)	 but	 it	 does	 not	
mention	 “fairness”.	 As	 an	 alternative,	 it	mentions	 only	 “non-
discrimination”	 (§	 IX).	 The	 Brazilian	 legislator,	 rather	 than	
adopting	the	general	clause	of	“fairness”,	preferred	specifying	
it	in	the	sense	of	non-discrimination.[22]	
Computer	Science	literature	generally	understands	algorithmic	
fairness	as	non-discrimination[16,17,18].	For	instance,	Lepri	et	
al.	 recently	defined	 fairness	 as	 “the	 lack	of	discrimination	or	
bias	in	the	[algorithmic]	decisions”[16].	
3 The	European	Court	of	Justice	caselaw	on	fairness	in	
Data	Protection	law	
	
The	European	Court	of	Justice	has	never	defined	the	notion	of	
fairness	 in	 data	 protection	 law.	 However,	 the	 Court	 made	
several	references	to	the	principle	of	fair	data	processing.	
The	 Court	 has	 used	 the	 notion	 of	 fairness	 in	 two	 different	
contexts:	fair	balance	and	transparency.	
As	regards	fair	balance,	the	Court	has	firstly	referred	to	fairness	
as	an	interpretative	tool	for	balancing	the	different	interests	at	
stake,[23,24]	or	the	data	subject’s	interests	to	data	protection	
with	 the	 burden	 which	 the	 data	 protection	 obligations	
represent	for	the	data	controller,[25]	or	–	more	generally	-	the	
fundamental	 right	 to	privacy	and	 the	 interests	requiring	 free	
movement	of	personal	data.[26]	A	balancing	is	“fair”	if	it	is	not	
based	on	 “an	 invidious	 choice	between	 two	such	 rights”[27].	
More	recently,	the	Court	in	the	Google	Spain	Case	said	that	a	fair	
balance	 requires	 a	 specific	 consideration	 of	 the	 substantial	
circumstances	 and	 interests	 at	 issue:	 “that	 balance	 may	
however	 depend,	 in	 specific	 cases,	 on	 the	 nature	 of	 the	
information	in	question	and	its	sensitivity	for	the	data	subject’s	
private	 life	 and	 on	 the	 interest	 of	 the	 public	 in	 having	 that	
information,	 an	 interest	 which	 may	 vary,	 in	 particular,	
according	 to	 the	 role	 played	 by	 the	 data	 subject	 in	 public	
life”.[28,27]	
On	the	other	hand,	the	Court	has	also	interpreted	the	notion	of	
fairness	 in	 data	 protection	 as	 inherently	 related	 to	 the	
implementation	 of	 the	 transparency	 principle	 in	 specific	
circumstances.	In	particular,	when	public	administrative	body	
transfers	personal	data	to	another	public	body	[29,30,31],	e.g.	
customs	 authority	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 its	 subsequent	
processing	[31]	they	must	notify	the	data	subjects	about	such	
further	processing.	
Clifford	 and	 Ausloos	 conclude	 that,	 in	 the	 reasoning	 of	 the	
Court,	 fairness	 gives	 a	 level	 of	 protection	 to	 the	 inherent	
asymmetric	data	subject-controller	relationships	and	hence,	the	
potential	for	negative	consequence	for	data	subjects	stemming	
from	 personal	 data	 processing	 even	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 a	
controller	intent	to	deceive.[5]	
	
4 The	Effects-based	approach	of	ICO	and	CNIL:	Fairness	
as	substantial	rebalancing	of	asymmetric	relationship	
	
Recently,	 the	 English	 and	 the	 French	 Data	 Protection	
Authorities	 have	 elaborated	 on	 the	 notion	 of	 fairness	 in	 the	
GDPR.	
In	 particular,	 the	 Information	 Commissioner’s	 Office,	 in	 a	
report	on	Big	Data,	AI	and	data	protection,[32]	has	proposed	an	
original	interpretation	of	the	fairness	principles.[33]	
According	 to	 the	 ICO,	 fairness	 involves	 three	 elements:	 1)	
considerations	 of	 effects	 on	 individuals;	 2)	 consideration	 of	
expectations	 of	 data	 subjects;	 3)	 transparency	 of	 data	
processing.	
While	the	link	between	fairness	and	transparency	is	clear	in	the	
wording	 of	 the	 GDPR,	 the	 connection	 between	 fairness	 and	
expectations	is	more	implicit,	but	not	new	in	the	legal	discourse.	
[14,15,5]	Article	 29	Working	Party	 opinion	on	Transparency	
has	 also	 associated	 fairness	 with	 the	 considerations	 of	
reasonable	expectations	of	and	effects	on	data	subjects.[8]	
The	link	between	fairness	and	effects	 is	 innovative	but	in	line	
with	 the	 aforementioned	 considerations:	 the	GDPR	 seems	 to	
refer	to	fair	processing	as	based	on	specific	circumstances	and	
situations,	 looking	 at	 the	 substantial	 balancing	 between	
different	parties.	In	other	words,	what	matters	is	the	effect	on	
the	data	subject,	not	a	mere	compliance	to	procedural	duties.	
In	a	recent	report,	also	the	French	CNIL	has	proposed	a	similar	
approach:	 fairness	 principle	 should	 be	 interpreted	 as	 the	
prevention	of	unjust	“outcomes”	or	“impacts”.[35]	In	addition,	
according	to	the	CNIL	the	effects	should	be	assessed	not	only	
on	the	data	subject,	but	at	a	collective	level	[21].	
This	 position	 is	 inherently	 linked	 to	 the	 fair	 balancing	 of	
positions	between	data	 controllers	and	data	 subjects.	Taking	
for	 example,	 the	 case	 of	 algorithmic	 platforms,	 the	 French	
Conseil	 d’Etat	 (as	 rephrased	 by	 CNIL)	 affirms	 that	 “fairness	
consists	 of	 ensuring,	 in	 good	 faith,	 the	 search	 engine	
optimisation	(SEO)	or	ranking	service,	without	seeking	to	alter	
or	 manipulate	 it	 for	 purposes	 that	 are	 not	 in	 the	 users’	
interest”.[36]	
On	 a	 more	 general	 level,	 in	 the	 algorithmic	 environment,	
“fairness	 could	 well	 represent	 a	 solution	 to	 the	 problem	 of	
unbalanced	 relations	 between	 controllers	 of	 algorithms	 and	
users”[21].	
In	sum,	this	first	analysis	suggests	that	fairness	is	a	corrective	
tool	 for	 rebalancing	 asymmetric	 or	 unbalanced	 relationships	
(i.e.	situations	of	induced	vulnerabilities)	between	controllers	
and	subjects.	We	will	come	back	on	these	conclusions	infra.	
	
5 Fairness	 in	 linguistic	 comparison:	 methodological	
remarks	
	
To	 better	 understand	 the	 notion	 of	 fairness	 in	 the	 GDPR,	 a	
useful	 method	 might	 be	 the	 linguistic	 comparison	 between	
different	official	translations	of	the	GDPR	in	several	other	EU	
official	 languages.	 The	 author	 is	 well	 conscious	 of	 the	
difficulties	 of	 a	 linguistic	 comparison,	 in	 particular	 because	
different	 translations	 might	 have	 ambiguities	 or	 different	
	
 
nuances	that	might	be	understood	just	in	that	specific	linguistic	
context.	
However,	 the	 European	 Court	 of	 Justice	 has	 affirmed	 that	 a	
correct	interpretation	of	EU	law	must	involve	a	comparison	of	
the	 different	 language	 versions,	 all	 equally	 authentic	
expressions	 of	 EU	 legislation.[6]	 In	 addition,	 the	 Court	 has	
clarified	 that	 Community	 law	 uses	 terminology	 which	 is	
peculiar	to	its	own	context.	Accordingly,	legal	concepts	do	not	
necessarily	have	the	same	meaning	in	EU	law	and	in	the	law	of	
the	various	Member	States.[6]	
The	 linguistic	 comparison	 cannot	 be	 the	 only	 tool	 for	
understanding	the	proper	notion	of	fairness	in	the	GDPR:	such	
comparison	must	be	accompanied	by	systemic,	contextual	and	
teleological	 interpretation	 (as	 the	 one	 presented	 at	 Section	
4)[6].	
	
5.1. How	 other	 EU	 Languages	 translate	 the	 concept	 of	
fairness	
	
The	different	translations	of	the	fairness	principle	in	the	GDPR	
reveal	different	nuances	and	perspectives.	
For	 this	 comparison,	 as	 shown	 in	 table	 1,	we	 have	 analyzed	
some	 of	 the	most	 relevant	 official	 translations	 of	 the	 GDPR,	
considering	 different	 linguistic	 families:	 German,	 Dutch,	
French,	Spanish,	Portuguese,	Italian,	Romanian,	Greek,	Polish,	
Swedish	and	Slovenian.1	
The	 provisions	 taken	 into	 account	 are	 not	 only	 the	 GDPR	
articles	and	recitals	mentioning	the	concept	of	fairness	but	also	
Article	8	of	the	Charter	of	Fundamental	Rights,	that	mentions	
the	concept	of	fairness	as	part	of	the	fundamental	right	to	data	
protection.	
	
Figure	 1:	 Linguistic	 comparison	 about	 the	 concept	 of	
Fairness	
Before	 analyzing	 specific	 national	 translations,	 we	 can	
preliminary	observe	that	the	term	“fair”	in	the	majority	of	other	
European	 languages	 is	 translated	 in	 at	 least	 two	 or	 three	
	
1 	The	 author	 chose	 these	 languages	 (which	 are	 among	 the	 most	
representative	 ones	 of	 the	 European	 linguistic	 families)	 because	 he	
different	 words,	 referring	 to	 slightly	 different	
concepts/nuances.	 In	 addition,	 several	 translations	 have	
similar	 etymologies	 (e.g.	 Spanish	 and	 Portuguese	 versions;	
Italian	and	Romanian	versions,	etc.).			
In	 the	German	version	of	 the	GDPR,	 fairness	 is	 translated	as:	
“nach	Treu	un	Glaube”	 (Articles	5(1)	and	6(2)(3);	 recitals	39	
and	45)	and	“faire”	(Articles	13(2),	14(2)	and	40(2);	recitals	39,	
60	and	71).	There	 is	even	a	 third	different	word	 for	 “fair”	at	
recital	129,	“gerecht”,	although	we	are	aware	of	 the	different	
context	of	that	recital,	where	fairness	refers	to	the	activity	of	
the	DPAs	not	to	the	data	processing	itself.	Article	8	of	the	EU	
Charter	also	uses	“Treu	und	Glaube”	to	refer	to	fair	processing	
of	personal	data.	
The	two	main	words	used	are	not	properly	synonyms.	On	the	
one	hand,	“treu	und	Glaube”	is	a	legal	milestone	in	the	German	
legal	history	and	refers	to	the	roman	concept	of	“bona	fide”.[62]	
On	 the	other	hand,	 “faire”	 is	 semantically	much	more	 in	 line	
with	the	English	“fair”.[37]	
The	use	of	 the	 two	different	words	 is	not	 random:	 “Faire”	 is	
used	 only	 in	 conjunction	 with	 transparency	 (“faire	 und	
transparente”),	i.e.	at	Articles	13	and	14	on	information	duties	
or	at	Article	40	on	code	of	conducts	for	“fair	and	transparent”	
data	processing	(recitals	60	and	71,	where	 fairness	 is	also	 in	
conjunction	with	the	“transparency”	principle).	
On	the	other	hand,	“Treu	und	Glaube”	is	used	for	translating	the	
fairness	principle	when	it	is	linked	to	the	notion	of	lawfulness	
(“rechtmäßig	 und	 nach	 Treu	 und	 Glauben”):	 it	 is	 the	 case	 of	
Article	5	and	Article	6(2)-(3).	
	“Gerecht”	(recital	129)	is	also	a	direct	translation	of	the	English	
fair,	but	under	the	perspective	of	impartiality	and	justice,[38]	
and	 so	more	 in	 line	with	 the	 translation	 of	 “impartially	 and	
fairly”	at	recital	129.	
In	 the	 Dutch	 version	 of	 the	 GDPR,	 just	 one	 single	 word	
translates	the	English	“fair”:	“behoorlijk”.	This	term,	referring	to	
a	notion	of	“decency”,	“goodness”	and	of	course	“fairness”[39],	
is	 used	 both	 in	 conjunction	 with	 transparency	 and	 with	
lawfulness.	 However,	 Article	 8	 of	 the	 EU	 Charter	 uses	 a	
different	 expression:	 “eerlijk”,	 whose	 nuance	 is	 closer	 to	 the	
notion	of	“honest”,	“plain”.[40]	The	Dutch	version	of	the	Data	
Protection	Directive,	also	referred	only	to	eerlijk.[41]	Similarly,	
that	term	is	used	-	often	 in	the	negative	form	(“oneerlijke”)	-	
also	 in	 the	 Consumer	 protection	 framework.[42]	 The	 terms	
“behoorlijk”	 is,	 therefore,	 just	 a	 recent	 development	 in	 the	
GDPR.	Understanding	whether	this	linguistic	evolution	has	led	
(or	will	 lead)	 to	a	 legal	evolution	 is	beyond	 the	scope	of	 this	
research,	 but	 it	 reveals	 the	 fluid	 and	 dynamic	 nature	 of	 the	
fairness	concept	in	the	EU	framework.	
The	French	version	of	 the	GDPR	uses	 two	different	 terms	 to	
refer	to	fairness:	“loyale”	(Articles	5	and	6,	recitals	39,	45,	60)	
and	“equitable”	(Articles	13	and	14,	71	and	129).	
Analogously,	the	Spanish	and	Portuguese	versions	of	the	GDPR	
use	similar	expressions:	“leal”	and	“equitativo”.	
could	 profit	 from	different	 linguistic	 support	 from	different	 national	
experts	of	those	languages.	
	
 
 
There	is	obviously	a	similar	etymology	for	“loyale”	and	“leal”,	
on	the	one	hand;	and	“equitable”	and	“equitativo”,	on	the	other	
hand.		
In	particular,	 the	notion	of	 “loyale”/“leal”	might	be	 generally	
translated	 with	 the	 English	 “loyal”;[43,99,100]	 while	
“equitable”/“equitativo”	 are	 well	 translated	 with	 the	 English	
“equitable”.[44,101,102]	
In	 the	 German	 version	we	 noticed	 that	 the	 rationale	 for	 the	
distinction	 between	 the	 two	 terms	 (“Treu	 und	 Glaube”	 and	
“Faire”)	was	based	on	the	different	link	of	the	fairness	principle	
with	transparency	(faire)	and	lawfulness	(Treu	und	Glaube).	To	
the	contrary,	 in	the	French,	Spanish	and	Portuguese	versions	
this	 is	 not	 the	 case,	 where	 apparently	 the	 terms	 are	 used	
interchangeably.	
The	French	version	generally	uses	“loyale”,	while	“equitable”	is	
just	used	in	few	provisions	(at	Articles	13	and	14	and	recitals	
71	and	129).	Similarly,	in	the	Spanish	version	“leal”	is	generally	
used	 for	 fairness,	 apart	 from	 two	 cases	 (Article	6(2)-(3)	 and	
recital	 129)	 mentioning	 “equitativo/a”.	 On	 the	 contrary,	 the	
Portuguese	translation	of	fairness	is	largely	based	on	the	word	
“equitativo”/“equidade”,	with	just	few	but	relevant	exceptions:	
Articles	5(1)(a)	and	Article	6(2)-(3)	use	the	expression	“leal”,	
in	 line	 with	 the	 Portuguese	 version	 of	 Article	 8	 of	 the	 EU	
Charter.	 The	 two	 words	 have	 similar	 meanings,	 but	 while	
loyalty	refers	to	honesty	and	constant	allegiance	to	a	person	or	
an	 institution	 [45],	 equitability	 refers	 to	 “fairness	 and	
impartiality”	but	also	–	in	strictly	legal	terms	–	to	what	is	“valid	
in	equity	as	distinct	from	law”.[46]	
The	 (interesting)	 ambiguity	 of	 the	 term	 equitable	 (referring	
both	 to	 “fair”	 and	 to	 the	 legal	 notion	 of	 equity)	 needs	 to	 be	
investigated	 in	more	 detail.	 In	 the	 following	 section,	we	will	
analyse	 the	 strong	 link	 between	 “equitable”	 as	 expression	 of	
equity	and	“Treu	und	Glaube”	as	expression	of	the	Roman	law	
notion	of	“bona	fide”.	
Even	 the	 Romanian	 translation	 of	 “fair”	 has	 the	 same	
etymology	of	equitable:	“echitabile”.	Interestingly,	this	word	is	
just	a	recent	acquisition	of	the	GDPR:	both	the	Data	Protection	
Directive	[47]	and	Article	8	of	the	EU	Charter	translated	“fair”	
with	 the	 Romanian	 word	 “corect”	 (leading	 to	 the	 English	
“correct”[48]).	The	etymological	reference	to	“correctness”	can	
be	 found	 also	 in	 other	 two	 linguistic	 versions:	 Italian	 and	
Swedish.	
The	Italian	translation	of	the	GDPR	has	just	one	single	world	for	
fairness:	“corretto/a”.	The	only	exception	is	recital	129,	“equo”,	
also	translatable	as	equitable.[49]	Interestingly,	also	the	Italian	
version	 is	different	 from	 the	wording	of	 the	Directive	and	of	
Article	 8	 of	 the	 EU	 Charter.	 Article	 6	 of	 the	 Data	 Protection	
Directive	translated	fair	with	“leale”	(loyal),[50]	closer	to	the	
other	 aforementioned	 Romance	 languages	 versions	
(loyal/leal)	 and	 also	 to	 the	 Italian	wording	 in	 the	 consumer	
protection	 directives.[51][52]	 The	 new	 translation	 of	 fair	 as	
“corretto”	is	a	novelty	of	the	Italian	version	of	the	GDPR.	
Also	the	Swedish	version	refers	to	fairness	at	Article	5(1)(a)	of	
the	 GDPR	 as	 “korrect”	 (the	 principle	 is	 “korrecthet”).	
Surprisingly,	 this	 term	 totally	 overlaps	 with	 another	 data	
processing	principle:	accuracy	at	Article	5(1)(d)	is	translated	in	
the	 same	 way	 (“korrecthet”).	 However,	 this	 apparent	
ambiguity	 is	 clarified	 in	 the	 other	 provisions	 of	 the	 GDPR,	
where	 the	 word	 “fair”	 is	 always	 translated	 with	 “rattvis”	
(meaning	“equitable”).[53]	Actually,	“korrect”	was	used	also	in	
the	Data	Protection	Directive,	 but	 the	 Swedish	 translation	of	
Article	 8	 of	 the	EU	Charter	had	 adopted	 the	 term	 “lagenligt”	
(“lawful”),	 which	 recalls	 the	 strong	 semantic	 link	 between	
fairness	and	lawfulness.	
In	 Polish	 and	 Slovenian	 versions	 just	 one	 word	 is	 used	 to	
translate	fairness,	without	any	ambiguity	or	recent	evolution:	
“rzetelnie”	 in	 Polish	 and	 “pošteno”	 in	 Slovenian.	 The	 Greek	
version	of	 the	GDPR	uses	 two	alternative	 terms	 for	 fairness:	
“θεμιτή”	and	“δίκαιη”.	Apparently,	the	different	use	of	the	two	
terms	 is	 not	 random:	 the	 first	 word	 is	 used	 in	 all	 Articles	
referring	 to	 fairness,	 while	 the	 second	 word	 is	 used	 in	 all	
recitals	referring	to	fairness.	Since	recitals	should	be	meant	as	
interpretative	 tools,	while	 articles	 as	 normative	 sources,[54]	
we	 should	 refer	 to	 “θεμιτή”	 as	 the	 official	 translation	 of	
fairness,	 and	 to	 “δίκαιη”	 as	 the	 interpretative	 nuance	 to	
understand	 its	 meaning.	 Θεμιτή	 can	 be	 translated	 as	
“appropriate,	 fair,	 legitimate”,[55]	while	δίκαιη	 to	“fair	 trade,	
fair	 opportunity	 or	 punishment”.[56]	 Surprisingly,	 the	 word	
fairness	in	the	Greek	version	of	the	EU	Charter	(Article	8)	has	a	
very	 diverse	 etymological	 and	 semantic	 source:	 “νομίμως”	
(meaning	 “legality”[57]).	 It	 is	 different	 both	 from	 the	
translation	in	the	Directive	(article	6	also	referred	to	“θεμιτή”)	
and	 in	 the	aforementioned	 text	of	 the	GDPR.	Similarly	 to	 the	
Swedish	 case,	 the	 Greek	 version	 of	 Article	 8	 of	 the	 Charter	
seems	to	refer	to	the	notion	of	legality/lawfulness,	rather	than	
to	fairness	as	loyalty/equitability.	
Understanding	 the	 reasons	 and	 the	 consequences	 of	 this	
linguistic	choice	is	beyond	the	scope	of	this	research,	but	such	
differences	well	prove	the	semantic	complexity	and	the	diverse	
nuances	of	the	“fairness”	notion	in	all	European	languages.	
	
5.2. Fairness	as	“bona	fide”,	“correttezza”	and	“equity”	in	
Western	legal	systems	
After	 this	 overview,	 we	 can	 preliminary	 conclude	 that	 the	
notion	of	fairness	is	translated	with	several	different	nuances	
(in	accordance	or	 in	discordance	with	 the	previous	Directive	
and	 with	 Article	 8	 of	 the	 Charter).	 However,	 three	 main	
semantic	notions	can	be	identified	in	all	the	European	official	
translation	of	fairness	in	the	GDPR:	 loyal	(also	in	the	German	
version	“Treu	und	Glaube”),	equitable	and	correct.	
In	some	versions	different	words	are	used	interchangeably,	in	
other	versions	there	seems	to	be	a	specific	rationale	for	using	
different	terms	(e.g.,	in	German	when	fairness	is	associated	to	
transparency	 it	 is	 translated	 by	 “Faire”,	 while	 when	 it	 is	
associated	to	lawfulness	it	is	translated	by	“Treu	und	Glaube”;	
in	Greek	all	references	to	fairness	in	Articles	are	translated	by	
θεμιτή,	while	all	references	in	recitals	by	δίκαιη).	
	
 
However,	 the	 notion	 of	 loyalty	 (or	 loyauté),	 equity	 and	
correctness	have	common	roots	in	the	Western	legal	history.	
They	all	originate	from	the	Roman	law	notion	of	“bona	fide”.	In	
Roman	Law,	bona	fide	arose	as	a	reaction	to	strict	and	formal	
application	of	rules	(‘summum	ius,	 summa	iniuria’)[58,59,60],	
an	alternative	to	positivist	structures.[61,62]	The	principle	of	
good	faith	was	based	on	the	substantial	balancing	between	the	
disputing	 parties	 rather	 than	 on	 the	 formal	 requirements	 of	
written	law.	
This	has	been	translated	into	the	modern	private	law	systems	
in	different	ways.	An	analysis	of	the	principle	of	good	faith	in	
the	European	private	law	is	beyond	the	scope	of	this	research.	
Here	it	is	sufficient	to	understand	the	legal	and	semantic	link	of	
these	 concepts	 across	 Europe	 and	 how	 the	 private	 law	
discourse	on	loyalty/equity/correctness	might	be	readapted	to	
the	data	protection	framework.	The	Code	Napoléon	introduced	
the	principle	of	 “bonne	 foi”	at	Article	1134,	which	states	 that	
contractual	 obligations	 must	 be	 executed	 in	 good	 faith.	 The	
similar	notion	of	loyalty	is	not	written	in	the	law,	but	is	now	a	
consolidated	 principle	 in	 French	 case	 law	 and	 largely	
associated	 to	 “good	 faith”.[63,64]	 The	 principle	 of	 loyalty	 is	
meant	 as	 “agir	 à	 armes	 égales”,	 i.e.	 preventing	 asymmetric	
relationships	between	the	parties.[65,64]	The	duty	of	loyalty	in	
commercial	 relationships	 is	 intended	 to	 ensure	 a	 balance	
between	the	different	actors	and	consists	in	the	obligation	to	
inform	 the	 interlocutor	 and	 refrain	 from	 using	 reprobated	
means.[66]	Such	notion	of	loyalty	has	been	accepted	also	in	the	
data	 protection	 framework.[67]	 The	 Conseil	 d’Etat	 has	
associated	the	idea	of	loyalty	to	the	notion	of	“trust”:	disloyal	
data	 collection	 is	 a	 damage	 to	 data	 subjects’	 trust	
(“confiance”).[67]	
In	 the	German	Bürgerliches	Gesetzbuch	 (BGB),	 the	 notion	 of	
loyalty	and	“bona	 fide”	was	 introduced	at	§242,	according	 to	
which	 the	 debtor	 is	 obliged	 to	 carry	 out	 the	 contractual	
performance	 in	 accordance	 to	 what	 good	 faith	 (“Treu	 un	
Glaube”)	 requires,	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 specific	 trade	 at	
issue.[68]	This	provision	is	similar	to	Article	1134	of	the	French	
Civil	Code,	but	more	 tailored	on	 “the	 specific	 trade	at	 issue”,	
thus	 revealing	 the	 substantial	 and	 contextual	 nature	 of	
“fairness”/“Treu	und	Glaube”.[69]	
In	the	Italian	Civil	Code,	the	notion	of	good	faith	can	be	found	
both	as	 “correttezza”	 (Article	1175)	and	as	 “buona	 fede	 (Art.	
1375).	 Both	 these	 provisions	 affirm	 that	 the	 parties	 (debtor	
and	creditor	or	the	two	contracting	parties)	need	to	act	in	good	
faith:	the	two	notions	are	usually	conceived	interchangeably	as	
synonyms.[70]	 The	 Data	 Protection	 framework	 has	 adopted	
the	 word	 “correttezza”.	 Even	 the	 Italian	 jurisprudence	 has	
interpreted	 the	 notion	 of	 “correttezza”	 and	 “buona	 fede”	 as	
aimed	at	reaching	fair	balance	and	proportionality	among	the	
parties,[71]	also	seen	as	an	ethical	requirement	to	the	parties’	
behavior.[72,64]	 	 This	 notion	 was	 originally	 conceived	 in	
accordance	 with	 the	 principle	 of	 solidarity:[73]	 one	 party	
should	take	care	of	the	interests	of	the	other	party.[73]	
The	 link	between	 good	 faith	 and	 solidarity	 has	 been	broadly	
developed	under	the	Constitutional	notion	of	solidarity	(Article	
2	 of	 the	 Italian	 Constitution)	 [74-81].	 Accordingly,	 the	
consolidated	notion	of	“correttezza/buona	fede”	in	the	Italian	
legal	 system	 must	 be	 understood	 as	 the	 party’s	 duty	 to	
“protect”	also	the	“interests	of	 the	counterpart”,[82-85]	so	to	
reach	a	fair	balancing	(“giusto	equilibrio”)[86]	among	opposite	
interests,[87,70]	beyond	a	mere	formal	approach	to	positivist	
structures.[88]	
In	 Common	 Law,	 the	 principle	 of	 good	 faith	 is	 close	 to	 the	
notion	 of	 equity.[61,89,90]	 In	 our	 aforementioned	 linguistic	
research	 the	 use	 of	 the	 word	 “equitable”	 is	 often	 used	 as	 a	
synonym	of	fair	in	the	non-English	versions	of	the	GDPR	(See	in	
Table	 1	 the	 Spanish,	 French,	 Portuguese	 and	 Romanian	
versions	of	the	GDPR).	As	noted,	equitable	means	“fair”	but	also	
“valid	in	equity	as	distinct	from	law”.[46]		Equity	in	Common	
Law	has	three	main	functions:	“adapting	the	law	to	the	facts	of	
individual	cases,	fill	gaps	in	the	law	and	refuse	to	apply	unjust	
laws”.[91]	Equity	is	an	interpretational	tool	that	can	tailor	the	
strict	formality	of	rules	to	individual	cases,	taking	into	account	
possible	 gaps	 or	 cases	 of	 unfairness.	 Analogously,	 the	 Data	
Protection	 discourse	 on	 fairness	 is	 indeed	 a	 flexible	
overarching	 tool	 that	 should	 inspire	 the	 interpretation	 of	
existing	principles	[92]	and	rules,	even	rebalancing	asymmetric	
relationships.	[14,5]	
Therefore,	it	seems	that	the	historical	legal	link	between	bona	
fide	and	equity	is	largely	reflected	in	the	different	translations	
of	 the	 “fairness”	 principle	 across	 EU	 official	 languages	 (as	
equitability,	loyalty	and	correctness).	However,	even	the	notion	
of	“good	faith”	 in	common	law	countries,	and	in	particular	 in	
the	UK,	is	acquiring	increasing	importance	[103,	104,	105,	106,	
107,	 108,	 109]	 in	 particular	 under	 the	 perspective	 of	
rebalancing	 asymmetric	 bargaining	 power	 between	 the	
contracting	parties.	[110]	
In	all	these	legal	traditions,	the	notion	of	fairness	and	good	faith	
has	been	developed	mostly	in	contract	law.	The	Draft	Common	
Frame	 of	 Reference	 for	 European	 Contract	 Law	 (DCFR)	
explicitly	addresses	this	notions:	 ‘[t]he	expression	‘good	faith	
and	fair	dealing’	refers	to	a	standard	of	conduct	characterised	
by	honesty,	openness	and	consideration	for	the	interests	of	the	
other	 party	 to	 the	 transaction	 or	 relationship	 in	 question’	
(Article I-1:103).	 	 Even	 the	European	Commission	 (withdrawn)	
proposal	for	a	Common	European	Sales	law	proposed	the	same	
definition	of	good	faith	and	fair	dealing	of	the	DCFR.	
Even	 the	 Swiss	 Data	 Protection	 Act,[93]	whose	 last	 revision	
takes	 inspiration	 from	 the	 GDPR,[94]	 in	 the	 data	 protection	
principles		does	not	explicitly	mention	fairness	but	“good	faith”	
(“Treu	 und	 Glaube”,	 “bonne	 foi”	 and	 “buona	 fede”)	 and	
“proportionality”	(Article	4(2)	[93]).	Among	the	three	official	
translations,	only	 the	German	one	overlaps	with	 the	 fairness	
translation	in	the	GDPR	(Treu	und	Glaube).	Both	the	French	and	
Italian	versions	of	the	Swiss	Act	refers	to	“good	faith”	(bonne	
foi,	buona	 fede),	while	 the	GDPR	versions	 refers	 to	 “loyauté”	
and	“correttezza”	but	we	have	already	argued	supra	that	both	
	
 
 
the	notion	of	“loyauté”	(used	in	the	French	version	of	the	GDPR)		
and	of	“correttezza”	(used	in	the	Italian	version	of	the	GDPR)	
are	 generally	 considered	 synonyms	 of	 “good	 faith”	 in	 the	
respective	legal	systems.	
The	Swiss	Data	Protection	Act	 links	fairness	(as	“good	faith”)	
and	 proportionality:	 although	 there	 is	 no	 textual	 link	 in	 the	
GDPR	 between	 these	 two	 principles	 several	 commentators	
have	addressed	the	inherent	link	between	proportionality	and	
fairness	as	fair	balance[5]	as	reflected	also	in	the	CJEU	case-law	
(see	supra)	and	in	the	relationship	between	Article	8	and	52	in	
the	EU	Charter	of	fundamental	right.		
In	other	EU	legal	fields,	the	link	between	fairness	and	equity	or	
good	 faith	 is	 more	 explicit.	 In	 consumer	 law,	 Unfair	 Terms	
Directive	defines	“unfair”	what	is	“contrary	to	the	requirement	
of	good	faith	[and]	causes	a	significant	imbalance	in	the	parties’	
rights	 and	 obligations	 arising	 under	 the	 contract,	 to	 the	
detriment	of	the	consumer”	(emphasis	added)[95,51].	The	link	
between	 unfairness,	 good	 faith	 and	 significant	 imbalance	 in	
consumer	 law	 is	 in	 line	with	 the	 aforementioned	 reflections	
about	bona	fide	and	fair	balance	in	the	national	legal	histories	
[70][92]	(see	interestingly	also	Department	of	Justice	of	State	
of	Victoria:	“A	term	is	unfair	if:	it	causes	a	significant	imbalance	
in	the	parties	rights	and	obligations	under	the	contract,	it	is	not	
reasonably	 necessary	 to	 protect	 a	 legitimate	 interest	 of	 the	
trader,	it	would	cause	detriment	to	the	consumer”[96])	but	also	
in	 the	 data	 protection	 law	 [5].	 In	 the	 field	 of	 intellectual	
property	rights,	the	Directive	2004/48	explicitly	links	fairness	
to	“equitability”.[97]		
6		Preliminary	conclusions	on	the	notion	of	
fairness	in	the	GDPR	
We	have	thus	observed	that	fairness	in	the	GDPR	is	a	complex	
principle,	 embedding	 several	 different	 nuances	 and	 tasks.	
These	nuances	include	the	notion	of	transparency,	lawfulness,	
non-discrimination,	 but	 also	 the	 concepts	 of	 proportionality	
and	balancing.	
Fairness	in	the	GDPR	goes	beyond	mere	legality	(summum	ius,	
summa	 iniuria):	 it	 is	 aimed	 to	 the	 consideration	 of	 the	
substantial	 circumstances	 at	 stake.	 This	 means	 considering	
expectations	 of	 the	 individuals,	 effects	 on	 the	 data	 subjects,	
actual	interests	of	the	parties.	Among	possible	unfair	effects	we	
need	 to	 include	 discrimination,	 but	 also	 any	 other	 risks	 to	
fundamental	rights	of	individuals	(e.g.	manipulation).	
In	particular,	the	inherent	link	between	fairness	and	good	faith	
(as	shown	in	the	linguistic	comparison),	even	considering	the	
national	legal	traditions	in	terms	of	bona	fide	and	equity,	seems	
to	 suggest	 that	 fair	 should	 mean	 prevention	 of	 unfairly	
asymmetric	 relationships	 between	 subjects,	 balancing	 their	
substantial	interests	(or	their	“bargaining	power”).[110]		
In	 other	 words,	 fairness	 is	 an	 overarching	 interpretative	
principle,	aimed	at	preventing	situations	of	unfair	 imbalance.	
Also	 the	CNIL,	 as	already	mentioned	above,	 see	 fairness	as	a	
solution	 to	 “the	 problem	 of	 unbalanced	 relations	 between	
controllers	of	algorithms	and	users”.[21]	Similarly,	the	Council	
of	 Europe	Modernized	 Convention	 108	 defines	 fairness	 as	 a	
tool	for	re-balancing	different	interests.[15]	
Interestingly,	Article	29	Working	Party	 refers	 to	 “imbalance”	
when	 defining	 the	 notion	 of	 vulnerable	 data	 subjects.[112]	
Imbalance	 is	 inherent	 in	 most	 relationship	 between	 data	
subjects	 and	 data	 controllers,	 but	 we	 can	 argue	 that	 such	
imbalance	 becomes	 “unfair”	 when	 it	 is	 based	 on	 the	
exploitation	 of	 individual	 vulnerabilities	 from	 a	 dominant	
position.[19]	 In	 the	 algorithmic	 environment,	 such	
vulnerability	might	be	translated	as	all	cases	of,	e.g.,	potential	
manipulation	 and	 indirect	 discrimination,	 made	 possible	
through	 the	 great	 potentialities	 of	 predictive	 analytics	 and	
machine	learning.	
Accordingly,	at	least	one	way	to	articulate	fairness	might	be	the	
protection	of	 individual	vulnerabilities	and	 the	prevention	of	
vulnerability	 exploitation,	 as	 consequences	 of	 significant	
power	imbalance	between	individuals.	
7	Conclusion	
This	paper	has	proposed	an	 innovative	understanding	of	 the	
concept	 of	 fairness	 in	 the	 data	 protection	 field	 through	 two	
methodological	 tools:	 linguistic	 comparison	 and	 contextual	
interpretation.		
Section	2	addressed	the	notion	of	fairness	in	the	Context	of	the	
GDPR,	while	 section	 3	 observed	 how	 the	 European	 Court	 of	
Justices	addressed	 the	concept	of	 fairness	 in	data	protection.	
Then,	 Section	 4	 analysed	 Data	 Protection	 Authorities’	
understanding	 of	 fairness	 (in	 particular	 the	 French	 and	 the	
English	 one),	 while	 Section	 5	 has	 addressed	 a	 linguistic	
comparison	 of	 the	 term	 fairness	 in	 different	 European	
languages.	
In	 general,	 the	 notion	 of	 fairness	 is	 translated	 with	 several	
different	 nuances	 (in	 accordance	 or	 in	 discordance	with	 the	
previous	Data	protection	Directive	and	with	Article	8	of	the	EU	
Charter	 of	 Fundamental	 Rights).	 In	 some	 versions,	 different	
words	 are	 used	 interchangeably	 (it	 is	 the	 case	 of	 French,	
Spanish	and	Portuguese	texts),	 in	other	versions	there	seems	
to	be	a	specific	rationale	for	using	different	terms	in	different	
parts	of	the	GDPR	(it	is	the	case	of	German	and	Greek	version).	
The	 analysis	 has	 revealed	 three	 mean	 semantic	 notions:	
correctness	 (Italian,	 Swedish,	 Romanian),	 loyalty	 (French,	
Spanish,	 Portuguese	 and	 the	 German	 version	 of	 “Treu	 und	
Glaube”)	and	equitability	(French,	Spanish	and	Portuguese).	
Interestingly,	 these	 three	 notions	 have	 common	 roots	 in	 the	
Western	 legal	 history:	 the	 Roman	 law	 notion	 of	 “bona	 fide”.	
Taking	into	account	both	the	value	of	“bona	fide”	in	the	current	
European	legal	contexts	and	also	a	contextual	interpretation	of	
the	role	of	fairness	in	the	GDPR,	the	conclusion	of	this	paper	is	
that	 fairness	 refers	 to	 a	 substantial	 balancing	 of	 interests	
among	data	controllers	and	data	subjects.	The	GDPR	approach	
of	 fairness	 is,	 thus,	 effect-based:	 what	 is	 relevant	 is	 not	 the	
formal	 respect	 of	 procedures	 (in	 terms	 of	 transparency,	
lawfulness	or	accountability),	but	the	substantial	mitigation	of	
unfair	imbalances	that	create	situations	of	“vulnerability”.
