Analyze Detect and Remove Gender Stereotyping from Bollywood Movies The presence of gender stereotypes in many aspects of society is a well-known phenomenon In this paper we focus on studying such stereotypes and bias in Hindi movie industry Bollywood and propose an algorithm to remove these stereotypes from text We analyze movie plots and posters for all movies released since The gender bias is detected by semantic modeling of plots at sentence and intra-sentence level Different features like occupation introductions associated actions and descriptions are captured to show the pervasiveness of gender bias and stereotype in movies Using the derived semantic graph we compute centrality of each character and observe similar bias there We also show that such bias is not applicable for movie posters where females get equal importance even though their character has little or no impact on the movie plot The silver lining is that our system was able to identify movies over last years where such stereotypes were broken The next step is to generate debiased stories The proposed debiasing algorithm extracts gender biased graphs from unstructured piece of text in stories from movies and de-bias these graphs to generate plausible unbiased stories INTRODUCTION Movies are a reflection of the society They mirror with creative liberties the problems issues thinking perception of the contemporary society Therefore we believe movies could act as the proxy to understand how prevalent gender bias and stereotypes are in any society In this paper we leverage NLP and image understanding techniques to quantitatively study this bias To further motivate the problem we pick a small section from the plot of a blockbuster movie Rohit is an aspiring singer who works as a salesman in a car showroom run by Malik Dalip Tahil One day he meets Sonia Saxena Ameesha Patel daughter of Mr Saxena Anupam Kher when he goes to deliver a car to her home as her birthday present This piece of text is taken from the plot of Bollywood movie Kaho Na Pyaar Hai This simple two line plot showcases the issue in following fashion Male Rohit is portrayed with a profession an aspiration Male Malik is a business owner In contrast the female role is introduced with no profession or aspiration The introduction itself is dependent upon another male character daughter of One goal of our work is to analyze and quantify gender-based stereotypes by studying the demarc N Madaan S Mehta Agrawaal V Malhotra A Aggarwal Y Gupta M Saxena Analyze Detect and Remove Gender Stereotyping from Bollywood Movies cation of roles designated to males and females We measure this by performing an intra-sentence and inter-sentence level analysis of movie plots combined with the cast information Capturing information from sentences helps us perform a holistic study of the corpus Also it helps us in capturing the characteristics exhibited by male and female class We have extracted movies pages of all the Hindi movies released from present from Wikipedia We also employ deep image analytics to capture such bias in movie posters and previews Analysis Tasks We focus on following tasks to study gender bias in Bollywood I Occupations and Gender Stereotypes How are males portrayed in their jobs vs females How are these levels different How does it correlate to gender bias and stereotype II Appearance and Description How are males and females described on the basis of their appearance How do the descriptions differ in both of them How does that indicate gender stereotyping III Centrality of Male and Female Characters What is the role of males and females in movie plots How does the amount of male being central or female being central differ How does it present a male or female bias IV Mentions Image vs Plot How many males and females are the faces of the promotional posters How does this correlate to them being mentioned in the plot What results are conveyed on the combined analysis V Dialogues How do the number of dialogues differ between a male cast and a female cast in official movie script VI Singers Does the same bias occur in movie songs How does the distribution of singers with gender vary over a period of time for different movies VII Female-centric Movies- Are the movie stories and portrayal of females evolving Have we seen female-centric movies in the recent past VIII Screen Time Which gender if any has a greater screen time in movie trailers IX Emotions of Males and Females Which emotions are most commonly displayed by males and females in a movie trailer Does this correspond with the gender stereotypes which exist in society RELATED WORK While there are recent works where gender bias has been studied in different walks of life Soklaridis et al MacNell et al Carnes et al Terrell et al Saji the analysis majorly involves information retrieval tasks involving a wide variety of prior work in this area Fast et al have worked on gender stereotypes in English fiction particularly on the Online Fiction Writing Community The work deals primarily with the analysis of how males and females behave and are described in this online fiction Furthermore this work also presents that males are over-represented and finds that traditional gender stereotypes are common throughout every genre in the online fiction data used for analysis Apart from this various works where Hollywood movies have been analyzed for having such gender bias present in them Anderson and Daniels Similar analysis has been done on children books Gooden and Gooden and music lyrics Millar which found that men are portrayed as strong and violent and on the other hand women are associated with home and are considered to be gentle and less active compared to men These studies have been very useful to uncover the trend but the derivation of these analyses has been done on very small data sets In some works gender drives the decision for being hired in corporate organizations Dobbin and Jung Not just hiring it has been shown that human resource professionals decisions on whether an employee should get a raise have also been driven by gender stereotypes by putting down female claims of raise requests While when it comes to consideration of opinion views of females are weighted less as compared to those of men Otterbacher On social media and dating sites women are judged by their appearance while men are judged mostly by how they behave Rose et al Otterbacher Fiore et al When considering occupation females are often designated lower level roles as compared to their male counterparts in image search results of occupations Kay et al In our work we extend these analyses for Bollywood movies The motivation for considering Bollywood movies is three fold a The data is very diverse in nature Hence finding how gender stereotypes exist in this data becomes an interesting study b The data-set is large We analyze movies which cover all the movies since So it becomes a good first step to develop computational tools to analyze the existence of stereotypes over a period of time c These movies are a reflection of society It is a good first step to look for such gender bias in this data so that necessary steps can be taken to remove these biases Data and Experimental Study Data Selection We deal with three different types of data for Bollywood Movies to perform the analysis tasks Movies Data Our data-set consist of all Hindi movie pages from Wikipedia The data-set contains movies for time period We extract movie title cast information plot soundtrack information and images associated for each movie For each listed cast member we traverse their wiki pages to extract gender information Cast Data consists of data for cast members who are Females and who are Males Since we did not have access to too many official scripts we use Wikipedia plot as proxy We strongly believe that the Wikipedia plot represent the correct story line If an actor had an important role in the movie it is highly unlikely that wiki plot will miss the actor altogether Movies Scripts Data We obtained PDF scripts of Bollywood movies which are available online The PDF scripts are converted into structured HTML using Machines We use these HTML for our analysis tasks Movie Preview Data Our data-set consists of official movie trailers of movies released between and These trailers were obtained from YouTube The mean and standard deviation of the duration of the all videos is and seconds respectively The videos have a frame rate of FPS and a resolution of p Each th frame of the video is extracted and analyzed using face classification for gender and emotion detection Octavio Arriaga Task and Approach In this section we discuss the tasks we perform on the movie data extracted from Wikipedia and the scripts Further we define the approach we adopt to perform individual tasks and then study the inferences At a broad level we divide our analysis in four groups These can be categorized as followsa At intra-sentence level We perform this analysis at a sentence level where each sentence is analyzed independently We do not consider context in this analysis b At inter-sentence level We perform this analysis at a multi-sentence level where we carry context from a sentence to other and then analyze the complete information c Image and Plot Mentions We perform this analysis by correlating presence of genders in movie posters and in plot mentions d At Video level We perform this analysis by doing gender and emotion detection on the frames for each video Octavio Arriaga We define different tasks corresponding to each level of analysis Tasks at Intra-Sentence level To make plots analysis ready we used OpenIE Fader et al for performing co-reference resolution on movie plot text The co-referenced plot is used for all analyses The following intra-sentence analysis is performed Cast Mentions in Movie Plot We extract mentions of male and female cast in the coreferred plot The motivation to find mentions is how many times males have been referred to in the plot versus how many times females have been referred to in the plot This helps us identify if the actress has an important role in the movie or not In Figure it is observed that a male is mentioned around times in a plot a Adjectives used with males b Adjectives used with females Va s Verbs used for MALES lies threatens rescues dies realises finds leaves proposes accepts saves kills shoots beats Highchartscom c Verbs used with males Va s Verbs used for FEMALES realises finds leaves accepts reveals agrees marries loves explains molest Highchartscom d Verbs used with females e Occupations used with males Occupations used with females Figure Gender-wise Occupations in Bollywood movies while a female is mentioned only around times Moreover there is a consistency of this ratio from to for almost years Cast Appearance in Movie Plot We analyze how male cast and female cast have been addressed This essentially involves extracting verbs and adjectives associated with male cast and female cast To extract verbs and adjectives linked to a particular cast we use Stanford Dependency Parser De Marneffe et al In Fig and we present the adjectives and verbs associated with males and females We observe that verbs like kills shoots occur with males while verbs like marries loves are associated with females Also when we look at adjectives males are often represented as rich and wealthy while females are represented as beautiful and attractive in movie plots Cast Introductions in Movie Plot We analyze how male cast and female cast have been introduced in the plot We use OpenIE Fader et al to capture such introductions by extracting relations corresponding to a cast Finally on aggregating the relations by gender we find that males are generally introduced with a profession like as a famous singer an honest police officer a successful scientist and so on while females are either introduced using physical appearance like beautiful simple looking or in relation to another male character daughter sister of The results show that females are always associated with a successful male and are not portrayed as independent while males are portrayed to be successful Occupation as a stereotype We perform a study on how occupations of males and Figure Total Cast Mentions showing mentions of male and female cast Female mentions are presented in pink and Male mentions in blue females are represented To perform this analysis we collated an occupation list from multiple sources over the web comprising of occupations We then extracted an associated noun tag attached with cast member of the movie using Stanford Dependency Parser De Marneffe et al which is later matched to the available occupation list In this way we extract occupations for each cast member We group these occupations for male and female cast members for all the collated movies Figure shows the occupation distribution of males and females From the figure it is clearly evident that males are given higher level occupations than females Figure presents a combined plot of percentages of male and female having the same occupation This plot shows that when it comes to occupation like teacher or student females are high in number But for lawyer and doctor the story is totally opposite Singers and Gender distribution in Soundtracks We perform an analysis on how gender-wise distribution of singers has been varying over the years To accomplish this we make use of Soundtracks data present for each movie This data contains information about songs and their corresponding singers We extracted genders for each listed singer using their Wikipedia page and then aggregated the numbers of songs sung by males and females over the years In Figure we report the aforementioned distribution for recent years ranging from We observe that the gender-gap is almost consistent over all these years Please note that currently this analysis only takes into account the presence or absence of female singer in a song If one takes into account the Aligarh Haider Kaminey Kapoor and Sons Maqbool Masaan Pink Raman Raghava Udta Punjab Figure Total Cast dialogues showing ratio of male and female dialogues Female dialogues are presented on X-axis and Male dialogues on Y-axis So ng C ou nt Sound-track Analysis Highchartscom Figure Gender-wise Distribution of singers in Soundtracks actual part of the song sung this trend will be more dismal In fact in a recent interview this particular hypothesis is even supported by some of the top female singers in Bollywood In future we plan to use audio based gender detection to further quantify this Cast Dialogues and Gender Gap in Movie Scripts We perform a sentence level analysis on movie scripts available online We have worked with PDF scripts and extracted structured pieces of information using Machines Training Data Ac ra Bias -Accuracy with K-Nearest Neighbors Figure Representing variation of Accuracy with training data pipeline in the form of structured HTML We further extract the dialogues for a corresponding cast and later group this information to derive our analysis We first study the ratio of male and female dialogues In figure we present a distribution of dialogues in males and females among different movies X-Axis represents number of female dialogues and Y-Axis represents number of male dialogues The dotted straight line showing y x Farther a movie is from this line more biased the movie is In the figure Raman Raghav exhibits least bias as the number of male dialogues and female dialogues distribution is not skewed As opposed to this Kaminey shows a lot of bias with minimal or no female dialogues Tasks at Inter-Sentence level We analyze the Wikipedia movie data by exploiting plot information This information is collated at inter-sentence level to generate a context flow using a word graph technique We construct a word graph for each sentence by treating each word in sentence as a node and then draw grammatical dependencies extracted using Stanford Dependency Parser De Marneffe et al and connect the nodes in the word graph Then using word graph for a sentence we derive a knowledge graph for each cast member The root node of knowledge graph is CastGender CastName and the relations represent the dependencies extracted using dependency parser across all sentences in the movie plot This derivation is done by performing a Figure Lead Cast dialogues of males and females from different movie scripts merging step where we merge all the existing dependencies of the cast node in all the word graphs of individual sentences Figure represents a sample knowledge graph constructed using individual dependencies After obtaining the knowledge graph we perform the following analysis tasks on the data Centrality of each cast node Centrality for a cast is a measure of how much the cast has been focused in the plot For this task we calculate between-ness centrality for cast node Between-ness centrality for a node is number of shortest paths that pass through the node We find between-ness centrality for male and female cast nodes and analyze the results In Figure we show male and female centrality trend across different movies over the years We observe that there is a huge gap in centrality of male and female cast Study of bias using word embeddings So far we have looked at verbs adjectives and relations separately In this analysis we want to perform joint modeling of aforementioned For this analysis we generated word vectors using Google wordvec Mikolov et al of length trained on Bollywood Movie data scraped from Wikipedia CBOW model is used for training Wordvec The knowledge graph constructed for male and female cast for each movie contains a set of nodes connected to them These nodes are extracted using dependency parser We as a b Figure Knowledge graph for Male and Female Cast sign a context vector to each cast member node The context vector consists of average of word vector of its connected nodes As an instance if we consider figure the context vector for MCastname would be average of word vectors of shoots violent scientist beats In this fashion we assign a context vector to each cast node The main idea behind assigning a context vector is to analyze the differences between contexts for male and female We randomly divide our data into training and testing data We fit the training data using a KNearest Neighbor with varying We study the accuracy results by varying samples of train and Figure Centrality for Male and Female Cast test data In Figure we show the accuracy values for varying values of While studying bias using word embeddings by constructing a context vector the key point is when training data is we get almost accuracy refer to Figure This pattern shows very high bias in our data As we increase the training data the accuracy also shoots up There is a distinct demarcation in verbs adjectives relations associated with males and females Although we did an individual analysis for each of the aforementioned intra-sentence level tasks but the combined inter-sentence level analysis makes the argument of existence of bias stronger Note the key point is not that the accuracy goes up as the training data is increased The key point is that since the gender bias is high the small training data has enough information to classify correctly of the cases Movie Poster and Plot Mentions We analyze images on Wikipedia movie pages for presence of males and females on publicity posters for the movie We use Dense CAP Johnson et al to extract male and female occurrences by checking our results in the top responses having a positive confidence score After the male and female extraction from posters we analyze the male and female mentions from the movie plot and co-relate them The intent of this analysis is to learn how publicizing a movie is biased towards a female on advertising material like posters and have a small or inconsequential role in the movie Pe nt e Percentage of female-centric movies over the years Percentage of female-centric movies over the years Highchartscom Figure Percentage of female-centric movies over the years Figure Percentage of female-centric movies over the years While of the movie plots have more male mentions than females surprisingly more than movie posters feature actresses Movies like GangaaJal Platform Raees have almost male mentions in plot but female mentions whereas in all posters females are shown on posters very prominently Also when we look at Image and Plot mentions we observe that in of the movies female plot mentions are less than half the male plot mentions while in posters this number is around Our system detected female-centric movies where this stereotype is being broken To further study this we plotted centrality of females and their mentions in plots over the years for these movies Figure shows that both plot mentions and female centrality in the plot exhibit film film an increasing trend which essentially means that there has been a considerable increase in female roles over the years We also study the number of female-centric movies to the total movies over the years Figure shows the percentage chart and the trend for percentage of female-centric movies It is enlightening to see that the percentage shows a rising trend Our system discovered at least movies in last three years where females play central role in plot as well as in posters We also note that over time such biases are decreasing still far away from being neutral but the trend is encouraging Figure shows percentage of movies in each decade where women play more central role than male Movie Preview Analysis We analyze all the frames extracted from the movie preview dataset and obtain information regarding the presence/absence of a male/female in the frame If any person is present in the frame we then find out the emotion displayed by the person The emotion displayed can be one of angry disgust fear happy neutral sad surprise Note that there can be more than one person detected in a single frame in that instance emotions of each person is detected We then aggregate the results to analyze the following tasks on the data Screen-On Time Figure shows the percentage distribution of screen-on time for males and female characters in movie trailers We see a consistent trend across the years where mean screen-on time for females is only a meagre compared to of the time for male characters Portrayal through Emotions In this task we analyze the emotions most commonly exhibited by male and female characters in movie trailers The most substantial difference is seen with respect to the Anger emotion Over the years anger constitutes of the emotions displayed by male characters as compared to the of emotions displayed by female characters Another trend which is observed is that female characters have always been shown as more happy than male characters every year These results correspond to the gender stereotypes which exist in our society We have not shown plots Figure Percentage of screen-on time for males and females over the years Figure Year wise distribution of emotions displayed by males and females for other emotions because we could not see any proper trend exhibited by them Algorithm for Bias Removal System For this task we take a news articles data set and train word embedding using Google wordvec Mikolov et al This data acts as a fact data which is used later to check for gender specificity of a particular action as per the facts Apart from interchanging the actions we have developed a specialized module to handle occupations Very often gender bias shows in assigned occupation Male Doctor Female Nurse or Male Boss Female Assistant In Figure we give a holistic view of our system which is described in a detailed manner as follows Figure Bias Removal System I Data Pre-processing We first perform data pre-processing of the words in fact data and do the following operations a used Wordnet to look-up if the word present in fact data is present in WordnetMiller or not If it was not present in Wordnet the word was simply removed b used Stanford stemmer to stem the words so that the words like modern modernized etc dont form different vectors II Generating word vectors After we have the pre-processed list of words from fact data we train Google wordvec and generate word embedding from this data We do a similar operation on biased data which in our case is movies data from Bollywood III Extraction of analogical pairs The next task is to find analogical pairs from fact data which are analogous to the man-woman pair As an instance if we take an analogical word pair x y and we associate a vector P x y to the pair then the task is to find P x y Here in the above equation we replace man and woman vectors by he and she respectively The above equation becomes P x y The main intent of this operation is to capture word pairs such as doctor or nurse where in most of the data doctor is close to he and nurse is closer to she Therefore for x y doctor nurse P doctor nurse is given by Another example of x y found in our data is king queen We generate all such x y pairs and store them in our knowledge base To have refined pairs we used a scoring mechanism to filter important pairs If y where is the threshold parameter then add the word pair to knowledge base otherwise ignore Equivalently after normalizing and we calculated cosine distance as which is algebraically equivalent to the above inequality IV Classifying word pairs After we identify analogical pairs we observe that the degree of bias is still not known in each pair So we need to classify word pairs as specific to a gender or neutral to the gender For example Consider a word pair doctor nurse we know that whether male or female anyone can be a doctor or a nurse Hence we call such a pair as gender neutral On the contrary if we consider a word pair king queen we know that king is associated with a male while queen is associated from a female We call such word pairs as gender specific Now the task is to first find out which pairs extracted in the above step correspond to gender neutral and which ones correspond to gender specific To do this we first extract the words from knowledge base extracted from biased data and find how close they are to different genders For a word we calculate cosine score of with he as he If is very close to he then it is specific to a man Similarly for a word we do the similar operation for she And if is very close to she then it is specific to a woman If a word is almost equidistant from he and she then it is labelled as gender neutral V Action Extraction from Biased Movie Data After we have gender specific and gender neutral words from the fact data we work on the biased data to extract actions associated with movie cast We extract gender for movie cast by crawling the corresponding Wikipedia pages for actors and actresses After we have the corresponding gender for each cast in the movie we perform co-referencing on the movie plot using Stanford OpenIE Fader et al Next we collate actions corresponding to each cast using IBM API Machines and Semantic Role Labeler by UIUC Punyakanok et al VI Bias detection using Actions At this point we have the actions extracted from biased data corresponding to each gender We can now use this data against fact data to check for bias We will describe in the following system walkthrough section how we use it on-the-fly to check for bias VII Bias Removal We construct a knowledge graph for each cast using relations from Stanford dependency parser We use this graph to calculate the between-ness centrality for each cast and store these centrality scores in a knowledge base We use the between-ness centrality score to interchange genders after we detect the bias Walk-through using an example The system takes in a text input from the user The user starts entering a biased movie plot text for a movie say Kaho na Pyar Hai in Figure This natural language text is submitted into the system in which first the text is co-referenced using OpenIE Then using IBM API and UIUC Semantic Role Labeller actions pertaining to each cast are extracted and these are checked with gender specific and gender neutral lists If for a corresponding cast genderaction pair the corresponding vector is located in gender specific list then it can not be termed as a biased action But on the other hand if a cast genderaction pair occurring in the plot is not found in gender-specific but the opposite gender is found in gender-neutral list then we tag the statement as a biased statement As an example text if the user enters Rohit is an aspiring singer who works as a salesman in a car showroom run by Malik Dalip Tahil One day he meets Sonia Saxena Ameesha Patel daughter of Mr Saxena Anupam Kher when he goes to deliver a car to her home as her birthday present At the very fist step co-referencing is done which coverts the above text to Rohit is an aspiring singer who works as a salesman in a car showroom run by Malik Dalip Tahil One day Rohit meets Sonia Saxena Ameesha Patel daughter of Mr Saxena Anupam Kher when Rohit goes to deliver a car to her home as her birthday present After this step we extract actions corresponding to each cast and then check for bias Here corresponding to cast Rohit we have the following actions singer salesman meets deliver The gender for Rohit is detected by using wiki page of Hritik Roshan and is labelled as male We find actions corresponding to cast Sonia and find the following actions-daughter-of Then we run our gender-specific and gender neutral checks and find that the actions are gender neutral Hence there is a bias that exists We do the similar thing for other cast members Then at the background we extract highest centrality male and highest centrality female And then switch their gender to generate de-biased plot Figure shows the debiased plot Also there is an option given to the user to view the knowledge graphs for biased text and unbiased text to see how nodes in knowledge graph change Discussion and Ongoing Work While our analysis points towards the presence of gender bias in Hindi movies it is gratifying to see that the same analysis was able to discover the slow but steady change in gender stereotypes We would also like to point out that the goal of this study is not to criticize one particular domain Gender bias is pervasive in all walks of life including but not limited to the Entertainment Industry Technology Companies Manufacturing Factories Academia In many cases the bias is so deep rooted that it has become the norm We truly believe that the majority of people displaying gender bias do it unconsciously We hope that ours and more such studies will help people realize when such biases start to influence every day activities communications writings in an unconscious manner and take corrective actions to rectify the same Towards that goal we are building a system which can re-write stories in a gender neutral fashion To start with we are focusing on two tasks a Removing Occupation Hierarchy It is common in movies novel pictorial depiction to show man as boss doctor pilot and women as secretary nurse and stewardess In this work we presented occupation detection We are extending this to understand hierarchy and then evaluate if changing genders makes sense or not For example while interchanging male doctor female nurse to male nurse female doctor makes sense but interchanging male Figure The screen where a user can enter the text a Figure The screen where text is debiased and the knowledge graph can be visualized gangster to female gangster may be a bit unrealistic b Removing Gender Bias from plots The question we are trying to answer is If one interchanges all males and females is the plot/story still possible or plausible For example consider a line in plot She gave birth to twins of course changing this from she to he leads to impossibility Similarly there could be possible scenarios but may be implausible like the gangster example in previous paragraph Solving these problems would require development of novel text algorithms ontology construction fact possibility checkers and implausibility checkers We believe it presents a challenging research agenda while drawing attention to an important societal problem Conclusion This paper presents an analysis study which aims to extract existing gender stereotypes and biases from Wikipedia Bollywood movie data containing movies The analysis is performed at sentence at multi-sentence level and uses word embeddings by adding context vector and studying the bias in data We observed that while analyzing occupations for males and females higher level roles are designated to males while lower level roles are designated to females A similar trend has been exhibited for centrality where females were less central in the plot vs their male counterparts Also while predicting gender using context word vectors with very small training data a very high accuracy is observed in gender prediction for test data reflecting a substantial amount of bias present in the data We use this rich information extracted from Wikipedia movies to study the dynamics of the data and to further define new ways of removing such biases present in the data Furthermore we present an algorithm to remove such bias present in text We show that by interchanging the gender of high centrality male character with a high centrality female character in the plot text leaves no change in the story but de-biases it completely As a part of future work we aim to extract summaries from this data which are bias-free In this way the next generations would stop inheriting bias from previous generations While the existence of gender bias and stereotype is experienced by viewers of Hindi movies to the best of our knowledge this is first study to use computational tools to quantify and trend such biases
