From Fair Decision Making To Social Equality The study of fairness in intelligent decision systems has mostly ignored long-term influence on the underlying population Yet fairness considerations eg affirmative action have often the implicit goal of achieving balance among groups within the population The most basic notion of balance is eventual equality between the qualifications of the groups How can we incorporate influence dynamics in decision making How well do dynamics-oblivious fairness policies fare in terms of reaching equality In this paper we propose a simple yet revealing model that encompasses a selection process where an institution chooses from multiple groups according to their qualifications so as to maximize an institutional utility and dynamics that govern the evolution of the groups qualifications according to the imposed policies We focus on demographic parity as the formalism of affirmative action We first give conditions under which an unconstrained policy reaches equality on its own In this case surprisingly imposing demographic parity may break equality When it doesnt one would expect the additional constraint to reduce utility however we show that utility may in fact increase In real world scenarios unconstrained policies do not lead to equality In such cases we show that although imposing demographic parity may remedy it there is a danger that groups settle at a worse set of qualifications As a silver lining we also identify when the constraint not only leads to equality but also improves all groups These cases and trade-offs are instrumental in determining when and how imposing demographic parity can be beneficial in selection processes both for the institution and for society on the long run CONCEPTS Social and professional topics Government technology policy Applied computing Law social and behavioral sciences Decision analysis KEYWORDS selection processes fairness demographic parity affirmative action influence on society dynamics social equality INTRODUCTION As many aspects of human society become increasingly automated questions of ethical nature migrate into the technological sphere Admittedly no amount of formalization can capture all the complexity and subtlety of these issues Yet one is compelled to mathematize them and integrate them with familiar frameworks The result of this process is the design of purportedly ethically-minded technology An important component of this process then is to understand just how well such technology interacts with society and whether its use does indeed result in the intended effect Automated decision and policy making particularly the data-driven case embodied by machine learning is one such technology that has recently alloted considerable attention to these ethical questions In particular guaranteeing non-discriminatory behavior has been at the forefront of research Various formalizations of nondiscrimination have been proposed relationships between these notions have been studied and fundamental trade-offs have been identified Yet the influence of the resulting decision systems on society has only garnered modest treatment One place where this question has been thoroughly considered is in studying the evolution of negative stereotypes in labor markets in economics The dynamics there however are very carefully crafted to mimic the labor market To relate the formalism of the current paper with these prior work see Section This paper starts by proposing a selection process where an institution chooses from multiple groups according to their qualifications so as to maximize an institutional utility In this context non-discrimination often takes the form of constraining the type of selection policies Demographic parity for example enforces groups to have equal selection rates This is a simple yet rich model that has been well studied and as such this paper chooses it as the archetype of non-discrimination referring to it with the more colloquial name of affirmative action AA But non-discrimination is rarely a goal in and of itself Ultimately one tacitly expects a benefit to society What kind of expected benefit is implicit in AA The fact that a fully transformed society does not require nondiscrimination hints at a possible answer This is in particular true if the groups themselves are indistinguishable If one accepts that such social equality is the intended effect of non-discrimination then the question becomes does AA lead to it To answer this modeling how the populations change in response to policies is not simply a luxury but a necessity This paper starts with some natural tenets and derives from them a model of dynamics that govern the evolution of the groups qualifications according to the imposed policies These dynamics are general enough to model behavior beyond the specific ones in prior work The paper then proceeds by first giving conditions under which an unconstrained policy reaches equality on its own In this case surprisingly imposing AA may break equality When it doesnt one would expect the additional constraint to reduce utility however it can be shown that utility may in fact increase In practice AA acts in two possible ways Either selection rates of the privileged are reduced or those of the underprivileged are increased This dichotomy is at the heart of the starkly different ways in which non-discrimination manifests itself In real world scenarios unconstrained policies do not lead to equality In such cases it can be shown that although imposing AA may remedy it there is a danger that groups settle at a worse set of qualifications As a silver lining one can identify exactly when the constraint not only leads to equality but also improves all groups To summarize the contributions of this paper are as follows A simple yet flexible model for both a selection process by an institution and dynamics describing the change in the population due to selection policies A characterization of the policies resulting from institutional utility maximization without and with imposing affirmative action as non-discrimination Conditions under which society equalizes for each type of policy along with the impact on the long-term institutional utility These cases and trade-offs are instrumental in determining when and how imposing demographic parity can be beneficial in selection processes both for the institution and for society on the long run The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section covers the most relevant related work Section formulates the problem and establishes the models Section derives the policies that arise from the models and characterizes the conditions under which they lead to social equality Sections and study the contrast between imposing affirmative action or not in the case when not imposing it naturally leads to equality or not respectively Section concludes RELATED WORK On the economics side a large literature exists examining statistical discrimination dating back to Arrow Prior work has attempted to study the effect of affirmative action in the labor market to remove stereotypes where stereotypes are defined as misrepresenting the quality of a worker from a disadvantaged group when groups are assumed to be ex-ante equal The models of and are the most related to the present work they both set up a game in a market between workers and employers where workers have the choice to invest in themselves to become qualified and emit a test signal that employers threshold as their policy The dynamics that this game generates on the distribution of qualified individuals per group is very specific In particular it is restricted to be unimodal Both papers look at sufficient conditions for equality and propose interventions to actively reach it The current paper trades off the concreteness of this line of work for more domain generality through less specific dynamics This helps garner more insight about the fundamental interplay between the constraints and changes in society Moreover examining dynamics and tracking the populations through time instead of only looking at equilibria as in allows comparing cumulative utility which plays a role in short term considerations A recent work raised very similar questions to the ones considered here The main difference in that setup is that individuals are characterized by a potentially non-binary score and are studied over only a single step of the selection process The influence of the selection is modeled by a social utility function that can be interpreted as the expected change in score for an individual due to selection The authors do not suggest that this change is due to population shifts though it could be Without tailoring specifically to have such an interpretation it is not possible to track distributions of scores over long time horizons The dynamics proposed here implements precisely that aspect and enables the study of both institutional utility and social equality that emerge from fairness constraints Another somewhat related work is that of which models the retention rate of users of a particular service as a function of that services quality There this is thought of as the error of a learning algorithm and the authors propose a robust learning approach to avoid amplifying the difference in retention rate by group The present formulation also bears some similarity to reinforcement learning due to the dynamics being essentially Markovian As such it can be thought of as an optimal control problem The goal here however is to analyze policies that are unaware of the dynamics and do not make an explicit effort to learn it Also the focus is not simply on utility but the secondary objective of social equality too Previous work has explored fairness with learning guaranteeing that actions are preferentially selected only if they effectively generate more reward However there are many key differences such as the state and action space in the current model being continuous as opposed to the discrete versions treated in and having deterministic transitions Work in online decision making has also explored fairness constraints but in a bandit setting that lacks the dynamical aspect PROBLEM FORMULATION Society groups qualification profiles Throughout this paper the total population is divided into two groups indexed by the variable G group G A which constitutes the fraction and group G B the fraction The limitation to only two groups simplifies the exposition yet maintains the essence of the problem One can conceptually think of each individual in either group as having some attribute that bears information about qualification For example in a college admission scenario the attribute can be GPA SAT Letters of recommendation This attribute is thought to provide a complete description in this context In what follows is implicitly mapped through an estimator to a crisp evaluation of qualification say v if qualified and v otherwise The assumption is that this binary classification is sufficient to characterize the utility that the individual would bring This is compatible with the work on statistical discrimination An alternative way to reach this model is to first consider a more general multiclass characterization and then show that a Figure Selection process and influence dynamics Two subgroups of the population have each publicly known qualification profiles An institution performs a selection by maximizing utility U possibly subject to a nondiscrimination constraint The selection policies influence the profiles at the next round through dynamics threshold policy is optimal with respect to utility and societal improvement as was done in This again indicates that a binary characterization ie above and below the threshold is often sufficient For the example of admissions one can think of v as indicating an individual likely to be successful in college Let the distribution of evaluations V v in group G be denoted by G This probability distribution is the qualification profile of group G Instead of tracking individuals it is more natural to study changes in the population in terms of the qualification profiles of groups For example in college admissions it is not the same students that would change their qualifications in response to admission policies but rather those of the next application cycle Institution policy utility selection rates The population undergoes a selection process An institution referred to also by policy maker designs a policy V vG AB that maps each individual to a probability of selection possibly depending on the group identity The institution also places a utility on each possible evaluation v through a map u R v Since v and v are assumed to be beneficial and detrimental respectively and to avoid trivial policies where none/all are selected in what follows assume u u The average institutional utility of a policy can then be defined as follows U AB v V v G v G Any given policy also defines per group selection rates v V vG V v G For college admission this corresponds to acceptance rates per group Note that each term in the sum is the rate corresponding to a particular evaluation Denote these by vG V vG V v G In what follows for notational convenience the explicit V and G are dropped from the expressions of the qualification profiles policies and selection rates since the context of the argument is clear Influence Dynamics The execution of a selection policy can be thought of as demarcating time t The main premise of this paper is that the selection process affects the population namely by changing the qualification profiles of either group at time t This change can be interpreted in different ways It could be due to genuine change within society the institutions policies can then be thought of as having a secondary effect as social incentive or deterrent But change could also be due to self-selection in the pool of individuals available to the institution on the next time step policies then have the effect of filtering through time possibly without society itself changing Although the model is not specific to an interpretation when the perspective moves to social equality in Section the tacit assumption is that dynamics are due to genuine change Dynamics are in general very complicated They may vary in time be stochastic and depend on many parameters of the problem Some of these aspects however are more relevant than others for capturing the fundamental effects In what follows dynamics are taken to be time-invariant and deterministic Time-invariance is a convenient assumption which can be supported by the slow change in the way in which society responds to stimuli Determinism does not mean that there is no stochasticity within society but that any such change is summarized through the evolution of the qualifications Moreover one can interpret these deterministic dynamics as the expectation of a more general stochastic dynamics As such it is a Markovian assumption with the state consisting of the qualification profiles Finally what parameters of the problem should govern change and in what manner should they do so There are three tenets that lead to this papers proposal a Within each group there is an a priori distribution of potential qualifications identical to the qualification profiles at the previous time step b Upon observing the previous time steps policy individuals respond by instantiating with some probability as a posteriori qualified or unqualified c The response probabilities which summarize how policies influence individuals depend only on the selection rates within the group of the individual and their potential qualification Tenet a describes societys inertia in the absence of influencing policies Tenet b could be thought of as a result of adequate or lacking individual effort in response to policies In tenet c the fact that potentially qualified and potentially unqualified individuals may be influenced differently is necessary for the history of qualifications to have relevance The main restriction thus is that the only influence of policies is through selection rates within a group Lack of influence across groups is an idealization of such influence arguably being weaker than within a group As for selection rates being the key variable rather than the selection policy itself one can motivate it by considering extremes indeed if no qualified or unqualified individuals exist then selection policy for qualified or unqualified individuals is never observed and cannot have influence With these tenets dynamics induced by the influence of policies can be defined as follows Assumption Dynamics For a given group let the group index dropped here and later for clarity denote the qualification profile of group for v at time t and let the policies at that time step induce the selection rates Then the qualification profiles at time t are given by where and are two arbitrary continuously differentiable functions The pair is referred to as the dynamics These dynamics make the tenets concrete For each group G describes the potential qualification profile The function represents the retention at the top the rate of retention of the sub-population with potential v due to the current policy The function represents change for the better the fraction of the potential v sub-population that progresses to have evaluation Equivalently one can pair these with their counterparts to describe full conditional distributions The pair change for the worse and are the conditional distribution describing the response of an individual with potential v into actual evaluations or respectively while the pair retention at the bottom and are the same respectively for an individual with potential v It is worth making a couple of remarks about these dynamics First the two groups responses are identical since the choice of and does not depend on the group To justify this note that in fairness considerations such as demographic parity one makes the inherent assumption that the groups are ex-ante equal in all respect except for their qualification profiles as otherwise there may be other reasons to treat them differently based only on their identity Second the groups do not interact through the functional form of the dynamics Differences between groups and any potential coupling between groups can only happen through the different and interacting selection rates induced by the policies Finally leaving and entirely arbitrary is good for generality but may lead to esoteric behavior It may be more reasonable to to restrict them in certain natural ways One assumption to make for example is that change is harder than retention Assumption Status quo bias For all x y y y Utility Maximization and Non-discrimination The primary tendency of the institution is to maximize its average utility Rarely if ever are institutions aware of the underlying dynamics Thus dynamics-oblivious policies are the appropriate ones where the utility is maximized over a single time step Next two approaches taken in practice are modeled unconstrained maximization without any non-discrimination considerations and affirmative action via demographic parity Unconstrained In the simplest of settings institutional utility maximization amounts to solving the following linear program LP at every time step t max Ut is as in with all quantities defined at time step t Affirmative Action If the evaluation v is perfect then the unconstrained policy is trivially identity blind thus one could argue that it is fair in the sense of equalized opportunity However as distributions of qualified individuals differ per group the policy will have different selection rates per group Affirmative action AA at an intuitive level attempts to bridge such inequalities between different groups More precisely AA forces equal aggregate selection rates between groups and it is more formally known as demographic parity This paper adheres to this as the archetype of non-discrimination Definition Affirmative Action The affirmative action constraint forces the policy to select at an equal rate between both groups Thus in this case the policy maker solves with the additional constraint Since the constraint is linear in the optimal policy is also found via a LP This is elaborated in Section ROAD TO EQUALITY With the models of selection process dynamics and affirmative action in place one can now ask the main question when and how can resulting policies lead to social equality Perhaps the simplest notion of equality within the population can be defined as the groups becoming indistinguishable in their qualification profiles This is formalized as follows Definition Social Equality Under given dynamics a policy is said to be equalizing if for all starting and lim t A B When this happens say that the policy/population reaches equality which is understood to be in an asymptotic sense This section characterizes the policies that result in both the unconstrained and affirmative action settings and studies the relationships between these policies and the conditions under which they become equalizing Unconstrained Resulting policy First consider the case when the institution does not impose non-discrimination that is the utility is maximized as in without further constraints Denote this case by UN It is then straightforward to see that the optimal policies are and for all time t Note that the policy only depends on the distribution at time t Any dynamics for group is thus simply of the form where is defined in terms of according to Equation as For convenience denote the t th iterate of by by t Condition for equality Can an unconstrained policy be equalizing The following result from classical stability analysis proved for completeness in Appendix A characterizes exactly when this is possible Proposition Dynamics of are equalizing if and only if has a unique globally attracting equilibrium point Thus under the unconstrained policy the dynamics must have a unique attracting equilibrium point It is worth noting that if has an attracting point from all but a finite number of points then these must be unstable fixed points of A point is an unstable fixed point if yet for all and all small enough for large enough t depending on and t Since in the real world any reasonable dynamics would have noise these unstable points wont have an influence and one could alternatively assume that has a unique stable fixed point except at finitely many points If has a globally attracting fixed point then t converges to as t a constant function which is trivially a contractive mapping If this convergence is uniform then there would be a large enough T such that T is contractive One could instead consider the following stronger condition in the form that itself be a contractive mapping Definition Contractivity is a contractive mapping if L such that is L-Lipschitz x y x y y If is differentiable then this condition is equivalent to having the derivative of bounded by L on By an application of the Banach fixed-point theorem this shows that the condition of Definition is indeed sufficient for to have a globally attractive fixed point Recall the following Theorem Banach fixed-point theorem Let X d be a nonempty complete metric space and let X X be a contractive mapping Then admits a unique fixed-point X where can be found by choosing any arbitrary element x X and iterating the function ie define t x then To stress again contractivity is not a necessary condition to reach equality but it is a simple condition to place on the dynamics that captures the intuition of reaching equality More importantly since the dynamics are defined in terms of the functions and it is more useful to give conditions on the latter to obtain a contractive For and such that rewrite the requirement that L for L as L A first step is to take both and to be Lipschitz Assumption and are Lipschitz continuous with constants L and L respectively That is y x y and y x y This assumption is reasonable as one would expect the jump in the rate of retention or rate of change to be bounded as a function of the jump in the selection rates But looking at Equation it is not sufficient How large should L and L be triangle inequality L Thus a sufficient condition for to be a contractive mapping is max L Speed of convergence Contractivity is a restrictive condition but it has the obvious benefit of easily describing the rate at which the population reaches equality In particular if max AB then A B Equality is reached at a linear rate in the exponent to equalize to within an difference about log log L time steps are sufficient Affirmative Action Two resulting policies The following characterizes the solution of maximizing the utility as in under the additional constraint The proof can be found in Appendix A Proposition Assume that at time t and say that is advantaged Then the optimal policy is one of two cases depending only on u and u AA If u then under-acceptance AA If u then over-acceptance There are two possible cases through which affirmative action impacts the policy denoted by AA and AA These represent two drastically different approaches to fairness AA under-acceptance accepts fewer qualified individuals from the advantaged group so as to equalize the selection rates for qualified individuals between both groups On the other hand AA over-acceptance accepts unqualified individuals from the disadvantaged group in order to equalize the aggregate selection rates One could think of AA as increasing the standard for the advantaged group and as such reducing total selection rates As a peek at the intuition to develop this could possibly reduce the motivation for individuals to become qualified As for AA one could think of it as reducing the standard for the disadvantaged group It is not as evident whether this could potentially increase or decrease the motivation to become qualified One one hand it does present the possibility of leading to a more qualified overall society by increasing the total selection rates and training more unqualified people On the other hand selecting unqualified corresponds to the condition of the so-called mismatch hypothesis which claims that this could actually reduce the number of qualified individuals over time This mismatch effect has been amply debated in discussions on public policy with arguments on both sides One perspective of the current investigation is to understand how the dynamics tip the scales in this debate Conditions for equality Under AA the analysis of equality gets complicated This is mainly due to the fact that in Proposition there is a specific advantaged group If from one time step to the next the advantage changes the identities of the groups swap This in itself is not an issue unless the swap also causes a switch between the cases AA and AA This last situation will not be considered for two reasons first because it is too unwieldy and second because it does not arise if the dynamics are slow enough as formalized in Section The conditions for equality given here are thus provisional on remaining in AA or AA with swaps or without Here is a characterization to remain in one case at all times given with no proof as it follows from Proposition Proposition Let be the j-advantage condition Resolving equality either way note that Let u be the AA condition under j-advantage and let C u be the AA condition under j-advantage Then to remain in AA at all times it is necessary that for all t CAt CA CB and in particular it suffices that CA CB Similarly to remain in AA at all times it is necessary that for all t CAt C A C B and in particular it suffices that C A C B Another reason for the complication is because under AA the dynamics for one group depends on the other group in Proposition there always exists one for which the policy depends on the qualification profiles of The dynamics therefore have to be tracked jointly unlike in UN Write B fB B where fA and fB are two components of a joint dynamics function These components can be written in terms of and according to Equation and Proposition but have a complicated expression that accounts for all four cases who is advantaged and which AA case it is Nevertheless one could say that given dynamics of this form equality will be reached if as t tB for all and Similarly to the unconstrained case since this would otherwise give no guarantees on the speed of convergence one can require to satisfy the following contraction condition There exists L such that satisfies fB This does not quite fit the classical Banach fixed-point theorem but it is easy to show sufficiency That is if the dynamics satisfy this condition then the population will reach equality Indeed let t fB t and t fB t t therefore t fB t and the population will reach equality As in the unconstrained case this contractivity requirement on can be reduced to sufficient conditions on and Proposition Assume that AA holds at all times by the necessary or sufficient conditions of Proposition Then if max holds then society equalizes Proposition Assume that AA holds at all times by the necessary or sufficient conditions of Proposition Then if max L holds then society equalizes The proofs can be found in Appendix A Note that while social equality conditions for UN and AA can be related the conditions for AA is not comparable to either of them in the sense that there exist dynamics where one holds but the other does not Effect of Stereotypes Everywhere in this paper except in this subsection the policymaker is assumed to know exactly the distribution of qualifications of both groups But the institution relies on its estimator to identify qualified individuals errors in translate to errors in estimates of group qualifications and thus As a result of these errors it becomes hard to properly impose fairness constraints as even selections rates per true groups are unknown But the framework allows one to investigate the effect of certain types of errors on the dynamics At each time step t define the errors in the qualifications estimates as and such that A A and B B Then the institution has the following qualification estimates A A B B Assume the errors are small enough that one can sill identify which group truly is more qualified This translates to having B Furthermore restrict errors to be of the form of positive or negative stereotypes Concretely if call this negative stereotype the institution identifies only B of qualified individuals and considers the rest unqualified If call this positive stereotype then it identifies all qualified individuals correctly and mistakes A of unqualified individuals as qualified The institution bases its policy on these estimates however in terms of the actual distribution the implemented policy actually differs If the policy acted upon is UN meaning and with a positive stereotype the actual policy is And with a negative stereotype These policies are those that influence the next step distribution Note that in both cases the unconstrained condition for equality might fail to hold as the difference in selection rates between the two groups can be exaggerated Now consider that the institution applies affirmative action In the case of AA surprisingly given negative stereotype against group B no matter if group As qualification is overestimated or underestimated equality is reached under the same cases as if the true distribution been known no stereotypes However given a positive stereotype for group B then the conditions for equality under AA derived previously are no longer sufficient Thus the AA policy is robust to negative stereotypes against disadvantaged groups On the other hand with AA with a negative bias against group A and a positive bias for group B one can guarantee equality under the same cases as without stereotypes A further treatment of the actual policies and analysis of the above conclusions is left to Appendix B DYNAMICS IN CONTINUOUS TIME While discrete time DT describes successive selection-response steps naturally the arbitrary nature of the dynamics can lead to sudden jumps and oscillatory behavior These do not quite correspond to how populations evolve in the real world where one expects change to happen gradually and slowly through time Figure shows the evolution of the percentage of bachelor degree holders by sex in the United States of America In of men years and older held a bachelors degree or higher while of women did this gap has decreased through time as degree attainment increased for both sexes In of women held a college degree compared to of men thus the proportion of degree holders equalized between both sexes in years time One of the reported reasons behind this increase has been attributed to Title IX a civil rights law passed in aiming to eliminate discrimination in educational programs and the removal of quotas against disadvantaged groups A change that is smooth and gradual can be modeled by transforming the discrete time dynamics into continuous time The transformation is standard starting from dynamics and dropping group indices one can rewrite it as a difference equation men women Figure Percentage of the US population years and older holding a bachelor degree by sex from till adapted from Now assume that the difference from t to t t for all t is proportional to that from t to t linear interpolation t dividing by t t Now taking the limit as t dt The dynamics thus derived can be motivated in two ways As is shown next it maintains the properties of the DT dynamics regarding conditions leading to social equality Moreover it possesses additional properties that greatly facilitate the analysis The proof of this and all the following lemmas can be found in Appendix A Lemma Assume the unconstrained policy is implemented in both discrete time DT and continuous time If the sufficient condition of Definition for social equality holds for the DT dynamics with equilibrium point then the dynamics also converges to starting from any initial condition The following shows that populations in unlike in DT maintain their order Lemma Following either an unconstrained or affirmative action policy in will preserve the initial advantage For example if at t then for all t A B With Lemma reaching equality with AA is straightforward in if it does in DT Lemma If an AA policy in DT reaches equality then in equality is likewise reached Thus to summarize transitioning to does not break the conditions previously derived for DT but in fact facilitates them One can additionally give a bound on the difference of the distributions between groups at each time step Lemma If the DT dynamics is contractive with constant L then under the difference between the distributions of both groups t A B at any time t obeys e t L t e t L Motivated by these properties in what follows the remainder of the analysis of the behavior of the selection process on the groups distributions due to the different policies is performed under dynamics The treatment could have initially started with dynamics however the setup is more intuitive in DT and motivates the transition better AFFIRMATIVE ACTION UNDER NATURAL EQUALITY This section is concerned with the following scenario assume that using the unconstrained policy equality is reached what can happen if one instead follows an affirmative action policy Even though affirmative action may seem unnecessary as without requiring further intervention equality is reached but can there be any additional benefit to applying fairness constraints and is one guaranteed that in this setting equality will also be reached This is relevant since the policy maker may not be aware of operating in this regime Formally make the assumption that the dynamics under the unconstrained policy UN is contractive with constant implying that there exists a globally attracting point The precise questions are then Are the conditions for equality with affirmative action also met And how does the cumulative utility obtained under AA policies compare to that under the UN policy Because in advantage is maintained Lemma and Proposition applies Lemma if AA holds initially it continues to hold and the only remaining condition which is therefore sufficient is Equation It can be restated to require that the following doesnt hold for any The following then holds Theorem If equality is reached with an unconstrained UN policy then it is necessarily reached by an AA policy however with no more and possibly less utility at each step Proof Since equality is reached under the UN dynamics then where is the derivative of the dynamics under the UN policy Expanding in terms of the proposed dynamics where with respect to Suppose for some If then since both and take values in then at one attains its maximum and the other its minimum thus and have Now suppose if then the condition cant be satisfied as one will have else if then cant be satisfied as As the sufficient conditions for both AA and UN to reach equality are satisfied in the equilibrium point will be reached by both policies however their trajectories toward are different and thus each achieves a different utility At each time-step t to differentiate between the distributions due to different policies denote by AUN the distribution of A at time t due to the UN policy starting from t and similarly for AA The utility of the UN policy at time t is Ut UN u AUN u BUN and that of AA at time t is Ut AA u BAA u BAA Consider the difference of the utilities Ut UN Ut AA u AUN u BUN u BAA u BAA Since under AA and UN the trajectory of B is identical then BAA BUN thus Ut UN Ut AA u AUN BUN Following Proposition one has that t AUN BUN and thus the utility of the UN policy is always no less than that of AA In light of this the policy maker has no gain in enforcing affirmative action in this case Consider next acts on the population in this setting The sufficient condition for equality with the AA policy cannot be directly implied from the UN equality However under AA group As distribution trajectory will reach the equilibrium point as the groups policy is identical to the UN policy in On the other hand group distribution evolution through time is unclear The dynamics governing it is with t BAA BAA dt BAA t BAA t BAA Since converges to as t then t will only become a function of BAA and Therefore the dynamics will approximately become an ODE with one variable and oscillatory behavior cannot exist in first order one dimensional ODEs then BAA will converge to some fixed point of the dynamics necessarily below Looking closely if was initially below then the trajectory of will force group B to converge toward the equilibrium point On the other hand if then nothing can be said thus unfortunately only worse off equilibria are guaranteed Now lets assume the conditions for reaching equality with the AA policy are met to see what could be the consequence Specifically there exists such that for all in one has fB Similarly to the discussion in the AA section by comparing the cumulative utility with UN one surprisingly finds a lifeline for enforcing affirmative action Theorem Let u Assume UN and AA both satisfy sufficient conditions and to reach equality in DT assuming remaining in the same case Then if and satisfy the following and Then AA provides more utility in over an infinite time horizon The proof can be found in Appendix A This statement can be roughly restated to be that if under AA equality is reached faster than under the unconstrained policy then AA results in a utility gain This implies that rather than trading off speed of convergence and utility go hand in hand AFFIRMATIVE ACTION UNDER DISPARATE EQUILIBRIA Multiple Equilibria It is more realistic to expect that myopically maximizing utility is unlikely to equalize the qualifications of groups That is one expects following an unconstrained policy to not lead to equality To model this scenario the dynamics should not have a unique attracting equilibrium point In general one could have arbitrarily many even infinitely many fixed points for the dynamics In this section this is simplified to assuming that the dynamics under UN has a finite number of attracting fixed points each with its own basin of attraction and delimited by two repelling unstable fixed points Thus the UN policy would not equalize the groups unless they are initially close enough to fall in the same basin The notion of such dynamics can be formalized as follows Definition k-Equilibrium Dynamics A k-equilibrium mapping s a continuously differentiable function has stable attracting points for all i and limiting points e and such that for all one has n as n When i then the corresponding interval becomes when i it is and finally if the basin is Figure shows -equilibrium dynamics under an UN dynamics with the direction of the gradient illustrated at each point See Appendix C for the specific pair For dynamics of the form dt to be k-equilibrium dynamics necessary and sufficient conditions on the function are the following i This directly implies that for i are asymptotically stable fixed points and as a consequence s are unstable fixed points Figure -equilibrium mapping under UN policy To parallel the fact that conditions for thus far have mirrored that in DT note that these conditions are indeed necessary in DT but not sufficient because oscillations may result an example is a single equilibrium at with To make it work it suffices to modify condition to and additionally require that there exists a neighborhood of radius r i around every equilibrium point such that d Li for some Li for all r i r i These are local Lipschitz conditions that allow to control the rate of convergence to the equilibrium points Eliminating Disparate Equilibria The following shows that similarly to the single equilibrium UN the AA policy is equalizing even under a k-equilibrium UN Refer to Appendix A for the proofs of this section Theorem Assume status quo bias ie Assumption If is a k-equilibrium dynamics as in Definition that satisfies conditions and under an UN policy in DT then following AA with the DT dynamics reaches equality from any starting distribution Since necessary conditions for DT are sufficient for the same holds also for the dynamics The above theorem states that following AA is a guaranteed way to reach equality however equality comes at a price With only the necessary condition for a k-equilibrium dynamics in and assuming that AA holds AA leads to an eventual population with utility no better than under UN On the other hand when following AA equality will always be beneficial As before under the conditions of a k-equilibrium dynamics one cannot deduce that the conditions for AA hold Assuming that these conditions do hold it would actually guarantee a utility no worse than following the UN policy he following Theorem characterizes this Theorem If is a k-equilibrium dynamics under UN in enforcing AA results in an equilibrium where populations have a utility value no higher and possibly lower while if the conditions for equality under AA hold enforcing AA will result in an equilibrium where populations have a utility value no lower and possibly higher compared to the limiting population under UN Figure shows the difference between the gradient of under either AA and AA and UN for the dynamics which resulted in Figure in a -equilibrium UN This can be shown to satisfy the conditions to make the AA and AA policies equalizing Note how the gradient difference for AA points generally downward and leftward toward states with lower utility as opposed to that of AA which generally points upward and rightward toward equilibrium points with higher utility These illustrate qualitatively the kind of behavior characterized in Theorem Figure Illustration of Theorem for the AA and AA policies respectively under the same dynamics as that of Figure CONCLUSIONS Imposing fairness considerations on decision making systems requires understanding the influence that they will have on the population at hand Without knowledge of this influence seemingly fair constraints might in fact exacerbate existing differences between groups of the population This paper proposed a simple but expressive model of a selection process to concretely consider these concerns Namely affirmative action was studied in terms of its ability to equalize the qualifications of different groups Imposing one case of affirmative action was shown to guarantee equality at the cost of worse institutional utility and possibly decreasing the populations overall qualification level In another case however affirmative action was shown to lead to a policy with different characteristics equality cannot be directly guaranteed to hold but when it does it results in equilibria where the population becomes more qualified This paper is certainly not the last word on the role of dynamics in non-discrimination The hope is to spur many new lines of investigation The proposed model and analysis could serve as a framework to evaluate other non-discrimination constraints More ambitiously it could be used to motivate and derive new constraints with explicit awareness of their long term impact
