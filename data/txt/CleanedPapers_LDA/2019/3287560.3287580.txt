On Microtargeting Socially Divisive Ads A Case Study of Russia-Linked Ad Campaigns on Facebook Targeted advertising is meant to improve the efficiency of matching advertisers to their customers However targeted advertising can also be abused by malicious advertisers to efficiently reach people susceptible to false stories stoke grievances and incite social conflict Since targeted ads are not seen by non-targeted and non-vulnerable people malicious ads are likely to go unreported and their effects undetected This work examines a specific case of malicious advertising exploring the extent to which political ads from the Russian Intelligence Research Agency IRA run prior to US elections exploited Facebooks targeted advertising infrastructure to efficiently target ads on divisive or polarizing topics eg immigration race-based policing at vulnerable subpopulations In particular we do the following a We conduct US census-representative surveys to characterize how users with different political ideologies report approve and perceive truth in the content of the IRA ads Our surveys show that many ads are divisive they elicit very different reactions from people belonging to different socially salient groups b We characterize how these divisive ads are targeted to sub-populations that feel particularly aggrieved by the status quo Our findings support existing calls for greater transparency of content and targeting of political ads c We particularly focus on how the Facebook ad API facilitates such targeting We show how the enormous amount of personal data Facebook aggregates about users and makes available to advertisers enables such malicious targeting We deployed a system that shows the ads and the demographics of their targeting audiences available at CONCEPTS General and reference Empirical studies Measurement Human-centered computing Social networking sites Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing KEYWORDS advertisements targeting social divisiveness news media social media perception bias INTRODUCTION Online targeted advertising refers to the ability of an advertiser to select audience for their ads Such advertising constitutes the primary source of revenue for many online sites including most social media websites such as Facebook Twitter YouTube and Pinterest Consequently these websites accumulate detailed demographic behavioral and interest profiles of their users enabling advertisers to microtarget ie choose small tens or hundreds to thousands of users with very specific attributes like people living in a zipcode that read New York Times or Breitbart Beyond raising numerous privacy concerns targeted advertising platforms have come under scrutiny for enabling discriminatory advertising where ads announcing housing or job opportunities are targeted to exclude people belonging to certain races or gender In this paper we analyze the potential for a new form of abuse on targeted advertising platforms namely socially divisive advertising where malicious advertisers incite social conflict by publishing ads on divisive societal issues of the day eg immigration and racial bias in policing in the lead up to US presidential elections Specifically we focus on how ad targeting on social media sites such as Facebook can be leveraged to selectively target groups on different sides of a divisive issue with potentially false messages that are deliberately crafted to stoke their grievances and thereby worsen social discord We also investigate whether targeted ad platforms allow such malicious campaigns to be carried out in stealth by excluding people who are likely to report ie alert site administrators or media watchdog groups about such ads Our study is based on an in-depth analysis of a publicly released dataset of Facebook ads run by a Russian agency called Internet Research Agency IRA before and during the American Election on the year of Our analysis is centered around three high-level research questions How divisive is the content of the IRA ads We quantify the divisiveness of an ad by analyzing the differences in reactions of people with different ideological persuasions to the ad Specifically using US census-representative surveys we look at how conservative and liberal-minded people differ in a how likely they are to report the ad b how strongly they approve or disapprove the ads content and c how they perceive truthood or falsehood in ads claims Our analysis shows that IRA ads elicit starkly different and polarizing responses from people with different ideological pursuasions How effectively done was the targeting of the socially divisive ads We find that the Click Through Rate CTR a traditional measure of effectiveness of targeting of the IRA ads are an order of magnitude times higher than that of typical Facebook ads The high CTR suggests that the ads have been targeted very efficiently A deeper analysis of the demographic biases in the targeted audience reveals that the ads have been targeted at people who are more likely to approve the content and perceive fewer false claims and are less likely to report What features of Facebooks ad API were leveraged in targeting the also analyze the construction or specification of targeting formulae for the ads ie the combination of Facebook user attributes that are used when selecting the audience for the ads We find widespread use of interest attributes such as Black Consciousness movement and Chicano movement that are mostly shared by people from specific demographic groups such as AfricanAmericans and Mexican-Americans We show how Facebook ad APIs suggestion feature may be exploited by the advertisers to find interest attributes that correlate very strongly to specific social demographic groups Related Work Prior work has highlighted several forms of abuses of targeted advertising in Facebook such as for inappropriately exposing the private information of users to advertisers and for allowing discriminatory advertising eg to exclude users belonging to a certain race or gender from receiving their ads Our effort highlights a new and different form of potential abuse of these targeted advertising platforms in creating a social discord A rich body of prior work have focused on understanding filter bubbles echo chambers polarization and ideological discourse in social media as an emergent phenomenon We provide a complementary perspective on the topic by examining how echo chambers and polarization can be engineered on social

work conducted a detailed study about Facebook Ads environment by analyzing thousands of ads collected through a browser plugin More closely related to our work Kim et al gathered Facebook ads from individuals and analyzed who are behind divisive ad campaigns reporting suspicious foreign entities Differently we focus on understanding the disruptive ability of microtargeting for providing divisive political ad campaigns Finally our effort is complementary to prior work that attempts to understand the abuse of social media by misinformation campaigns especially along political elections Our work provides a better comprehension about a key dissemination mechanism of fake news stories highlighting how advertising platforms allow injection of misinformation in social systems and choose vulnerable people as the target RUSSIA-LINKED FACEBOOK ADS DATASET On May th the Democrats Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a dataset containing Facebook advertisements from and that are linked to a Russian propaganda group Internet Research Agency IRA Each ad is composed of an image and text Figure shows an example Additionally each ad contains a landing page which is a link to the host of the ad as well as an ad ID an ad targeting formula which is a combination of demographic behavioral and user interest aspects used to target Facebook users the cost for running the ad in Russia Rubles the number of impressions which is the number of users who spent some time observing the ad the number of clicks received by the ad and finally the ad creation and end dates This section provides an overview of these ads The ads in the dataset were run between June and August From the advertisements we found that were created in in and in Figure shows the distribution of these ads over time in terms of the number of ads created per month cost to run the ads and democrats-intelligencehousegov/ facebook-ads/ social-media-advertisementshtm We converted currency of the costs to

based on the number of ads impressions and clicks received Note that the y-axis is in log scale We observed that the number of impressions and clicks increases almost an order of magnitude around the election period shaded region There is also another peak in February just after the newly elected US President Donald Trump assumed office Landing Pages We first explore the ad landing pages the urls to which users who clicked on the ads were redirected There are unique landing pages corresponding to all the ads Figure shows the top landing pages per number of ads posted The most popular landing page fbcom/Black-Matters-/ posted advertisements Interestingly one of the top landing pages the musicfbinfo invites users to install a browser extension which was reported to send spam to the Facebook friends of those who installed it This landing page received impressions clicks and spent around US The domain musicfbinfo was also promoted by other pages accounting for of all ads We also find that the most popular landing pages are Facebook pages accounting for of all ads followed by blackmattersuscom and Instagram For ads we were not able to identify their landing pages because these pages were already blocked webarchiveorg/web//musicfbinfo/ wiredcom/story/ russia-facebook-ads-sketchy-chrome-extension/ Cost Impressions Clicks and CTR Figure a shows the cumulative distribution functions CDFs of all the ads in the dataset on their number of impressions clicks and amount spent to advertise The most expensive ad cost USD The highest number of impressions generated was and the maximum number of clicks was Nearly of the landing pages spent more than dollars of the pages received more than clicks and around had more than impressions On the other hand more than of the ads had no impressions clicks and cost suggesting these ads were not launched or ran for a very short period of time An average ad cost USD was seen by users and received clicks The average value is increased to USD for cost for impressions and for the number of clicks if we exclude those ads that appeared not to have been run The Pearsons correlation coefficient among cost impressions and clicks is very high particularly between impressions and clicks We also noted that this dataset is quite skewed as of the ads accumulate of the total cost of the total number of impressions of the total number of clicks However there were notable exceptions to this correlation higher investment cost did not always lead to higher return eg impressions clicks Table shows the most popular landing pages per impressions clicks and cost of the ads For example fbcom/ brownunitedfront/ received the largest number of impressions corresponding alone to of impressions obtained by all ads but cost only of the total cost of all ads in the dataset Finally we compute the click-through rate CTR of these ads which is a typical metric to measure the effectiveness of an ad It is computed as a ratio between the number of clicks and the number of impressions received by an ad Figure right shows the cumulative distribution function of the CTR of the ads excluding those with values for clicks impressions and cost The median CTR is and of the ads have a CTR higher than The average CTR is These are incredibly high values for CTR As a comparison WordStream released a report as of April which shows the average CTR for Facebook ads across all industries is As an example Retail is Fitness is Health care and Finance is This means that these political ads have a CTR that is about an order of magnitude higher than a typical Facebook ad High Impact Ads Our analysis reveals that only a few ads are responsible for most of the cost impressions and clicks Considering this we defined a set of high impact ads as the union of the top ads in terms of cost impressions clicks and CTR We obtained high impact ads corresponding to of the entire dataset These ads account together to of the total number of impressions of clicks of the cost and of the CTR For the purposes of our study where we require manual inspection of the ads to identify their targets and to run surveys our ensuing analyses concern those high impact ads run

the ads in the IRA dataset Our analysis highlights the landing pages that paid for the ads and identifies the most successful ads in terms of impressions and clicks We find that the ad campaigns were intensified near to the US election period Among our main findings we show that the typical CTR for these ads is an order of magnitude higher than typical values for Facebook meaning that these ads were very effective ANALYZING DIVISIVENESS OF THE ADS To investigate whether these ads were designed to be ideologically divisive that is designed to elicit different reactions from people with different political viewpoints we conducted three online surveys on a US census-representative sample n We used each survey to measure one of three axes along which ads could potentially be divisive reporting whether respondents would report the ads and why approval and disapproval whether they approve or disapprove the content of the ad and false claims if they are able to identify any false claims in the content of the ad Our surveys considered only those high impact ads which were run before the elections Each survey showed ten ads followed by demographic questions More detail on the specific questions used to assess each axis is provided in the corresponding axis subsections that follow The survey questions were pre-tested using cognitive interviews and all survey questions included a I dont know or Prefer not to respond answer choice to ensure internal measurement validity To obtain a demographically representative sample and ensure that we captured a wide variety of American perceptions we deployed the surveys using the Survey Sampling International survey panel a non-probabilistic census-representative survey panel For each survey we sampled at least respondents responses per ad whose demographics were representative of the US within and who had a range of political views liberal conservative and moderate or neutral across the three surveys we obtained a total sample of respondents We measured overall ideological divisiveness on the three axes reporting approval and false claims using two metrics Within-group divisiveness Within-group divisiveness measures the extent to which respondents answers about a particular ad are consistent with their political ideology That is do all liberals answer similarly about a particular ad For each ad we first calculate the standard deviation of all the responses and then we calculate the standard deviation of the responses within a particular ideological group Next we compute within-group divisiveness as the fraction of within-group standard deviation to the overall standard deviation Therefore we interpret values lower than as lower divisiveness and greater agreeableness within a group than overall and values greater than as greater within-group divisiveness than overall Between-group divisiveness Between-group divisiveness measures the extent to which answers from respondents of one political ideology differ from answers of respondents who align with another political ideology That is do liberals answer differently about a particular ad than conservatives For an ad we calculate the difference between the mean responses per ideological group and then compute the fraction of this difference over the maximum possible difference given the range of values to obtain the between-group divisiveness measure This limits the range of between-group divisiveness measure between and where higher values indicate greater divisiveness between ideological groups Table summarizes the divisiveness of the high impact ads We find that the within-group divisiveness measure is lower than for all our surveys This indicates high agreeableness within the ideological groups In addition about of the ads show betweengroup divisiveness higher than indicating severe divisiveness between ideological groups for those ads Measure Group Reporting Approval False Claims Mean Stdev Mean Stdev

of Inappropriateness Figure Distribution of the high impact ads on the a proportion of reported ads in our dataset b reasons of inappropriateness Likelihood of reporting the ads The first axis of divisiveness that we explored was reporting We surveyed respondents regarding Whether they would report the ad shown and If they would why do they find the ad inappropriate Answer choices given drawn directly from Facebooks reporting interface were sexually inappropriate violent offensive misleading disagree false news spam and something else Figure shows the reporting responses for the high impact IRA ads For over of these ads at least of the respondents responded that they would have reported the ads We observe that the majority of the ads were reported on the grounds of being offensive violent and misleading Additionally a substantial proportion of the reported responses belonged to the something else category In such cases the respondents entered free-text to explain their reason for inappropriateness Out of the responses that we received in the free-text box the pre-dominant reasons were that the ad incites racism and that the ad creates divide in the society Next to examine ideological divisiveness we find that the mean within-group divisiveness is stdev for liberals and stdev for conservatives Both of these within-group divisiveness measures being less than suggests that the likelihood with which individuals within the same ideological group agree about reporting an ad is higher than that when compared against individuals across ideological groups Specifically we asked Some social media platforms allow you to report content by clicking report Would you report this ad eg Mark it as inappropriate or offensive With answer choices Yes No I dont know Ad M ea n G ro

ideologies Defining a median threshold for divisiveness we find that in over percent of the ads liberals and conservatives completely disagreed with each other eg conservatives showed more than their median reported proportion and liberals showed less than their median reported proportion and the vice versa Table shows a few examples of the ads which showed the greatest differences in the reporting behavior by the respondents of two political ideologies These ads typically mention politically-charged topics For example immigration TAG YOUR PHOTOS WITH against Send us the reason why

help us make this viral Follow our account in order to spread the truth in this case presenting a viewpoint associated with the democratic party Approving content of the ads As another characterization of peoples reactions to the ads we asked respondents in a second survey whether they approve or disapprove of a particular ad and how strongly they approve or disapprove These questions in the survey were constructed based on questions about political preference that have been extensively pre-tested by Pew Research for previous surveys about political polarization We find that of the adds were approved and of the ads were disapproved by at least respondents see Figure a To quantify the received responses we assigned an approval score on a point scale with values of strong disapproval weak disapproval neither approve or disapprove weak approval and strong approval While computing the mean approval score for a group we dropped the responses to ensure Specifically we asked Do you approve or disapprove of what the ad says or implies Answer choices Approve Disapprove Neither There is nothing in this ad to approve or disapprove of I dont know Followed by a measure of strength Do you approve/disapprove very strongly or not so strongly if the prior question was answered with approve or disapprove Reported by both liberals and conservatives TAG YOUR PHOTOS WITH

reporting behavior by the respondents from two political ideologies that a mean approval score close to corresponds to similar weights from approval and disapproval Table lists some example ads along with their approval tendencies by the two ideological groups within our dataset Figures show the relationship between respondents ideology and approval of ad content We observe that the mean within-group divisiveness for liberals is stdev and stdev for conservatives Table Both the within-group divisiveness values being lower than suggests that the likelihood with which individuals within the same ideological group would agree about approving an ad is higher than that when compared against individuals across ideological groups The divisiveness in approval responses is further confirmed by the between-group divisiveness measure which ranges between and mean across the high impact ads Perceptions of false claims in the ads To examine whether the high impact IRA ads contained any false claims in another survey we asked the respondents if they could identify any false claims present in the ads We find that out of of the high impact ads were identified to have at least one false claim and about of the ads contained false claims according to of the respondents Figure a shows the cumulative distribution of the ads with the number of respondents who identified at least one false claim in them Next as in the other two content analyses we examined whether respondents ideology related to their perception of the presence of false claims Figure Both the within-group divisiveness values being lower than suggests that the likelihood with which individuals within the same ideological group would agree about finding false claim in an ad is higher than that when compared against Specifically we asked respondents to Please copy and paste any phrases or sentences in the advertisement that you think contain a factual claim That is something that someone could verify as True or False If you cannot identify any claims please type No Claims in the first box We then asked them to label the phrases they had identified as True False or not sure whether they are True or False

Table Example ads on the basis of false claims identified by the respondents from two political ideologies Identified false claims are highlighted in pink Summary This section focuses on peoples perceptions of the content of the IRA ads we identified as high impact To assess these perceptions along three axes likelihood of being reported approval and disapproval and the presence of false claims we conducted three US census-representative surveys Our analysis of the perceptions queried in these surveys shows that ideological opinions of individuals influence their perceptions of these ads We find that many of these ads were severely divisive and generated strongly varied opinions across the two ideological groups of liberals and conservatives see Figure ANALYZING THE TARGETING FORMULA Next we focus on understanding how the target formula is created by advertisers and the role that Facebook interface plays on that Targeting Possibilities The Facebook ads platform provides three approaches for advertisers to target people briefly described next Personally Identifiable Information PII targeting is the form in which advertisers provide personal information about users such as name phone number and email address so that Facebook can directly place the ads to them This kind of targeting does not appear in the IRA dataset Look-alike audience target For this targeting option advertisers provide to Facebook a list of users similar to that one in the PII or a list of people who liked the advertiser Facebook page Then Facebook attempt to target a similar audience to the group in this specific list Only of the high impact ads used this option Attribute-based targeting allows the advertiser to create a target formula based on a wide range of elements that include user basic demographics ie gender age location language advanced demographics ie political leaning income level Parents with children preschoolers interests ie newspapers religion politics and behaviors ie Business Travelers or New Vehicle buyers Recent work showed that the number of possible interests provide by Facebook is greater than Facebook allows one to include or exclude users with each of those attributes and combine multiple attributes as part of a target formula The vast majority of the high impact ads out of the used this option to elaborate a formula We found that of the ads used or more interests and behaviors in their formula creating very complex formulas with up to distinct attributes Figure shows the top attributes that appear in the ads target formula based on the number of times they appeared in different ads There were distinct attributes and the most present attributes interest were African-American history and African-American Civil Rights Movement appearing in ads We can note a prevalence of attributes related to African-American and Hispanic Population with interests like Mexico Hispanidad and Latin hip hop Next we investigate aspects of the Facebook ads platform design that might have favored the IRA ads to massively explore this particular targeting strategy Figure Top attributes based on the number of advertisements they appeared Figure Cumulative Distribution Function CDF for the number of suggestions The Role of Attribute Suggestions Facebook provides a tool for advertisers that given a target attribute it presents a list of other attributes that target people with similar demographic aspects For example in the list of suggested targeting interests for Townhallcom a page with an audience in which of the users are very conservative users according to Facebook there are other pages with similar bias towards very conservative users ie The Daily Caller RedState and TheBlaze In order to investigate if the IRA ads have used suggestions to elaborate complex targeting formulas we crawled the attribute suggestions for each attribute that appear in the dataset of highly impact ads Figure shows the cumulative distribution function for the number of suggested attributes that appear in the same formula We can see that around of the ads that potentially used this feature because they have at least three target attributes suggested by Facebook as part of the same formula There are of ads with more than suggested attributes in the same formula As an example all the interests including Islam Ramadan Islamism used in the target formula of the ad ID appear as suggestions for at least one of the others in the formula For ad ID we were able to find out of of the interests using the interest suggestion feature This provides evidence that this feature may have been a key element used by the IRA campaign to choose the target audience Summary In this Section we show that the vast majority of the IRA ads use attribute-based targeting containing complex target formula that includes interest and behavioral attributes that are likely suggested by Facebook Next we investigate the extent to which these formulas allowed advertisers to reach demographic biased audiences ANALYZING THE TARGET AUDIENCE We start by describing our methodology to reproduce the IRA queries without running the ad and gather the demographics of the of the targeted users Assessing the Audience Demographics Before launching an advertisement in Facebook the advertiser can get the estimated audience ie the number of monthly active users likely to match the target formula Our methodology consists of using the Facebook Marketing API to reproduce the targeting formula of all high impact IRA ads and get the demographics of the population that matches each targeting formula without running any ad This methodology has been extensively used recently for different purposes including inferring news outlets political leaning study migration and gender bias across countries and for public health awareness and lifestyle disease surveillance For our analysis we considered seven demographic categories political leaning race gender education level income location in terms of states and age As a baseline for comparison we also gathered the demographic distribution of the United States Facebook population Only of the used attributes that appear in the IRA ads targeting formulas are not available for targeting anymore due to changes in the Facebook Marketing API In most of these cases we reproduced the ad target formula without the missing attribute especially when the attribute looks redundant with the others in the formula We did not reproduce only targeting formulas Measuring Audience Bias To assess the audience bias of each of the demographic aspects that we considered we computed the differences between the fraction of the population with a demographic aspect and the same fraction of the population in the baseline distribution ie the US Facebook population namely the bias score For instance if the percentage of African-Americans in the audience of a particular ad is the bias score for this dimension in the ad is as the percentage of African-American in the US Facebook population is nearly Figure depicts the distribution of the measured bias on political leaning and ethnic affinity In comparison with all the demographic categories these two showed to be the ones with the highest biases developersfacebookcom/docs/marketing-apis Figure Bias in demographic dimensions Each violin represents the bias score for all high impact ads in a particular demographic dimension The median is represented by a white dot in the center line of the violin of the data is present between the two thick lines around the center Group Report Approval False Claims Liberals Conservatives Table Pearsons r correlation between targeting and the ideological divisiveness for the high impact ads p no statistical significance in the case of false claims We note that most of the ads target audiences that are more biased towards the African-Americans population and the Liberals More specifically about of the IRA ads target an audience with a higher proportion of African-Americans than in the US Facebook distribution This difference is even accentuated for Liberals with more biased in comparison with the reference distribution The percentage of ads with bias score superior to is for African-American and for Liberals Our dataset suggests the presence of those ads that target extremely biased populations of conservatives Liberals Hispanic and especially African-Americans The target audiences for the IRA ads are slightly biased towards women and young adults years which are omitted from Figure due to space constraints Targeting audience and Divisiveness Next we investigate if the advertisers target the ads towards audiences that are less likely to identify their inappropriateness due to their ideological perception bias Additionally we examine if the ads directed to biased audiences could leverage the already existing societal divisiveness to further amplify it among the masses To understand these nuances of targeted advertising in this section we focus on the relationship between the targeted population and the ideological divisiveness in reporting approval and false claim identifying behaviors for the ads Table reports the correlation values between the targeted population and the tendency of the population to report approve and identify false claims Reporting We observe a negative correlation in the case of reporting for both Liberals and Conservatives also see Figure a Liberals C on se rv at iv es Reported

ideological groups ace show the proportion of population targeted and their tendency of response Each circle represents an ad and their size is proportionate with the between group disputability for that ad compares the mean responses of the targeted ads with their hypothetical non-targeted counterpart ie overall responses where each ad is represented on the x-axis This suggests that the targeted population has a lower tendency to report than the non-targeted one This is also evident per Figure b where we find that the reporting by the targeted population carries way lower likelihood than the reporting by the overall or non-targeted population Approval We observe a positive correlation in the case of approval for both Liberals and Conservatives also see Figure c This suggests that the targeted population has a greater tendency to approve the ads as compared to the non-targeted population This is also evident per Figure d where we find that the approval score by the targeted population carries greater score for a majority of the ads compared to the overall or non-targeted population False claims For false claims we do not find any significant correlation between the targeted population and divisiveness However per Figure we do find that the targeted population has a lower tendency to identify false claims Taken together we can assume that the ads were well-targeted in a way towards that population which was more likely to believe and approve and subsequently less likely to report or identify false claims in them Summary Our findings show that the IRA ads reached audiences that are very biased towards African-Americans and Liberals More important we show that ads were overall targeted towards a population that is more likely to believe and approve and subsequently less likely to report or identify false claims in them CONCLUDING DISCUSSION In this paper we provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative characterization of the Russia-linked ad campaigns on Facebook Our findings suggest that the Facebook ads platform can be abused by a new form of attack that is the use of targeted advertising to create social discord These ads showed to be divisive were times more effective than a typical Facebook ad were biased especially in terms of race and political leaning and tended to be targeting more the users who are less likely to identify their inappropriateness We also provide strong evidence that these advertisers have explored the Facebook suggestions tool to engineer the targeted populations While this tool may be helpful in many ways it needs to be carefully redesigned to avoid that a malicious advertiser reaches so easily groups of vulnerable people For example Facebook recently presented its intention to manually inspect ads before they are launched aiming to guarantee that ads do not divide or discriminate people Our work suggests that the priority of the candidates to be manually inspected can be based on their targeting formula For instance those ads that target extremely narrowed populations on the basis of race political leaning and other sensitive topics have greater likelihood of being divisive Additionally the ads that experience severely high click-through rates could also be flagged to be quickly inspected As a final contribution we have deployed a system available at that displays the ads and their computed information such as the demographics of their targeting audiences
