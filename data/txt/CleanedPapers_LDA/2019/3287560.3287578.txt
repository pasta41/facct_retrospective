Downstream Effects of Affirmative Action We study a two-stage model in which students are admitted to college on the basis of an entrance exam which is a noisy signal about their qualifications type and then those students who were admitted to college can be hired by an employer as a function of their college grades which are an independently drawn noisy signal of their type Students are drawn from one of two populations which might have different type distributions We assume that the employer at the end of the pipeline is rational in the sense that it computes a posterior distribution on student type conditional on all information that it has available college admissions grades and group membership and makes a decision based on posterior expectation We then study what kinds of fairness goals can be achieved by the college by setting its admissions rule and grading policy For example the college might have the goal of guaranteeing equal opportunity across populations that the probability of passing through the pipeline and being hired by the employer should be independent of group membership conditioned on type Alternately the college might have the goal of incentivizing the employer to have a group blind hiring rule We show that both goals can be achieved when the college does not report grades On the other hand we show that under reasonable conditions these goals are impossible to achieve even in isolation when the college uses an even minimally informative grading policy CONCEPTS Mathematics of computing Probability and statistics Computing

of reasons including unequal access to primary education family support and enrichment activities different demographic groups can vary widely in their level of preparation by the time they reach their senior year of high school when they apply for college In an attempt to correct for this unfortunate reality many colleges in the United States follow some sort of affirmative action policy in their admissions which is to say their admissions decisions explicitly take demographics into account What is often unstated and perhaps not even explicitly considered by the colleges is what exactly the long term goals of these policies are beyond the short term goal of having a diverse freshman class In this paper we consider two explicit goals and study the extent to which they can be met in a simple two stage model Equal opportunity The probability that an individual is accepted to college and then ultimately hired by an employer may depend on an individuals type but conditioned on their type should not depend on their demographic group Elimination of Downstream Bias Rational employers selecting employees from the college population should not make hiring decisions based on group membership Neither of these desiderata will necessarily be achieved by admissions rules that ignore demographic information For example suppose college admissions is set by a uniform admissions threshold on entrance exam scores Assuming these scores are equally informative about all groups this will guarantee that conditioned on a students type whether or not she is admitted to college will be independent of her group membership but it does not imply that whether or not she is ultimately hired is independent of her group This is because exam scores are only a noisy signal about student type Therefore if two groups have different prior distributions on type they will have different posterior distributions on type when conditioned on being admitted to college according to a group-blind admissions rule The result will be that a Bayesian employer will insist that students from a group with lower mean or higher variance will have to cross a higher threshold on their college grades in order to be hired In addition to incentivizing explicit group-based discrimination by the employer this also results in a failure of equal opportunity for the students because once admitted to college two individuals of the same type might have to cross different grade thresholds in order to be hired Thus a simple group blind admissions rule fails to achieve either goal or as laid out above In this paper we study the extent to which these goals can be achieved via other means available to the college in particular how it admits and grades students Limitations of our Model When interpreting our results it is important to understand the scope and limitations of our model First this paper considers fairness goals that are limited to preventing inequity from being further propagated treating opportunities at the high school level and earlier as fixed and that do not attempt to correct for past inequity This manifests itself in that our equal opportunity goal takes as given that the prospects for employment may fairly vary as a function of an individuals type at the time at which they apply for college and does not attempt to address or correct the historical forces that might have resulted in different groups having different type distributions to begin with Attempting to correct for this kind of historical inequity would require a value-added model of education in which colleges can change the type distributions of their student population either through the direct effect of education or through a second order effect on student behavior before they apply In our model colleges do not change student types they only serve as signaling mechanisms Similarly our equal opportunity goal aims to equalize the probability that students are hired conditioned on their types but one might reasonably instead ask for a corrective notion of fairness in which the probability of passing through the pipeline is higher for the historically disadvantaged group conditioned on type We do not consider this Our model also ignores the possibility that exam scores and grades are themselves biased We explicitly assume the opposite that exam scores and grades are unbiased estimators of student types for both groups If instead exam scores were systematically biased downwards for one group then the response of a rational employer to an admissions policy would be very different because students who made it through the college pipeline despite negative bias would have a higher relative posterior probability of having a high type There is evidence that effects of this sort are real Further the abstraction of one dimensional stable types itself common in economic models is clearly an enormous simplification In reality the kind of talents valued by employers are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing We ignore these complications for simplicity but believe that studying them are natural and interesting directions for future work The two kinds of fairness goals that we study do not speak to the size of the student of employee population coming from each group For example in principle one could satisfy both the equal opportunity and elimination-of-downstream-bias goals that we propose but at a cost of employing very few individuals from one of the groups However we show that even without an additional goal of having large representation from both groups the fairness goals we set out cannot generally be achieved Finally we assume that employers are single-minded expectation maximizers with no explicit desire for fairness or diversity Of course this is often not the case Despite these limitations and simplifying assumptions we find that in the model we study many natural fairness goals are already impossible Our paper should be regarded as taking a first step in the study of fairness for pipelines of algorithmic decisions We think that these negative results are likely to persist in more complex models that attempt to capture additional realism It is worth exploring whether positive results can be achieved for natural approximations of our fairness notions If positive results can be found it would be good to see if they continue to hold as we relax some of the limiting assumptions in our model Our Model and Results We consider a simple model of admissions grading and hiring that views the role of colleges only as a means of signaling quality and performing a gatekeeping function rather than as providing explicit value added sets of the population divided according to socio-economic or other demographic lines Each student from group i is endowed with a type t which is drawn independently from a Gaussian type distribution Pi that is dependent on the students group membership A students type ultimately measures her value to an employer We model employers as having a fixed cost C for hiring an individual and a gain that is proportional to their type If the employer hires an individual who has type t they obtain utility t C A college can choose an admissions rule and a grading policy Although students types are unobservable each student has an admissions exam score that is an observable unbiased estimator of their type We model exam scores as being distributed as a unit variance Gaussian centered at the students type An admissions policy for the school is a mapping between exam scores and admissions probabilities We allow schools to set different admissions policies for different groups but for most of our results we require the natural condition that admissions probabilities within a group be monotonically nondecreasing in exam scores policies simply correspond to setting admissions thresholds based on exam scores For simplicity in the body of the paper we restrict attention to deterministic admissions rules but in the Appendix we extend our results to cover probabilistic admissions rules as well Schools may also set a grading policy A grade is also modeled as a Gaussian centered at a students true type but the school may choose the variance of the distribution for example by controlling the number of conditionally independent evaluations that go into a students grade We assume that a students grade is conditionally independent of her entrance exam score conditioned on her type One limiting extreme infinite variance corresponds to committing not to report grades at all This limiting case is actually achievable because schools can simply opt not to share grades in fact this practice has been adopted at several top business schools At the other limiting extreme types are perfectly observable This extreme is generally not achievable and we do not consider it in this paper In between the school can modulate the strength of the signal that employers get about student type beyond the simple indicator that they were admitted to college Employers know the prior distributions Pi on student types as well as the admissions and grading policy of the school They are literature beginning with with a lower exam score would have a higher probability of admission that a student with a higher exam score Non-monotonicity within a group is highly undesirable because it would give some students a perverse incentive to intentionally try and lower their exam scores If such incentives were present it would no longer be reasonable to model exam scores as unbiased estimators of student types rational expectation maximizers When deciding whether or not to hire a student they will condition on all information available to them a student a group membership the fact that she was admitted to college under the colleges admissions policy and the grade that she received under the colleges grading policy to form a posterior distribution about the students type They will hire exactly those students for whom they have positive expected utility under this posterior distribution In order to incentivize a particular employer to use a hiring rule that is independent of group membership it is necessary to set admissions and grading policies such that for every student admitted to the school and for every grade that she may receive the indicator that the conditional expectation of her type t is above the employers hiring cost C is independent of the students group membership If there is uncertainty about what the employers hiring cost C is or if there are multiple employers then it is necessary to guarantee this property for an interval of hiring costs C CC rather than for just a fixed cost We distinguish these two cases We call this property Irrelevance of Group Membership IGM in the single threshold and multiple threshold case respectively A seemingly stronger property that we might desire is that the posterior distribution on student types conditional on admission to college is identical for both groups We call this property strong Irrelevance of Group Membership sIGM Because it symmetrizes the two groups it in particular guarantees that members of both groups will be treated identically by rational decision makers at any further stage down the decision making pipeline It also is a natural goal in and of itself in a competitive market with employers who may offer different wages to different employees which might here be modelled as differing costs C for employment In such a market employees will in equilibrium be offered the posterior expectation of their type as their wage and so the sIGM property can be viewed as asking that for any two students with the same type their expected wage conditional on being admitted to college should be identical independent of their group We show that in the presence of finite nonzero variance in both exam scores and grades IGM in the multiple threshold case implies sIGM Finally we say that an admissions rule and grading policy satisfy the equal opportunity condition if a students probability of making it all the way through the pipeline ie being admitted to college and then being hired by the employer is independent of her group conditioned on her type Trivially any group-symmetric admissions policy will satisfy both conditions if the two group type distributions are identical so for the results that follow we always assume that the group type distributions are distinct differing in their mean their variance or both First to emphasize that our impossibility results will crucially depend on the fact that exam scores are only a noisy signal of student ability we consider the noiseless case in which college admissions can be decided directly as a function of student type this corresponds to the case in which exam scores have no noise In this case we can have it all there is a simple monotone admissions rule that guarantees both the equal opportunity condition and satisfies IGM for multiple thresholds for any grading policy that the school might choose After establishing this simple result in the rest of the paper we move on to the more realistic case in which exam scores are only a noisy signal of student type Next we study what is possible if the college chooses to not report grades at all In this case we can also have it all simply by setting a sufficiently high group independent admissions threshold a school can achieve both equal opportunity and IGM for multiple thresholds This gives another view of the effects of practicing grade non-disclosure at highly selective schools Finally in the bulk of the paper we study the common case in which the college uses informative grades ie sets the variance of its grade distribution to be some finite value In this case we show that it is possible to obtain IGM in the single threshold case but that no monotone admissions rule can obtain sIGM Because of the equivalence between sIGM and IGM for the multiple threshold case this implies that no monotone admissions rule can obtain IGM in the multiple threshold case even in isolation Next we consider the equal opportunity condition One trivial way to obtain it is to simply admit nobody to college We show that this is in general the only way in the multiple thresholds case no non-zero monotone admissions rule can satisfy the equal opportunity condition even in isolation Related Work Our work fits into two streams of research Within the recent line of work on algorithmic fairness the most closely related work is that of Chouldechova and Kleinberg Mullainathan and Raghavan Both of these papers prove the impossibility of simultaneously satisfying certain fairness desiderata in batch classification and regression settings Broadly speaking both papers show the impossibility of simultaneously equalizing false positive and false negative rates related to our equal opportunity goal see also and positive predictive value or calibration related to our IGM goals Our work is quite different however the goals that we study are not direct properties of the classification rule in question in our case the college admissions rule but instead properties of its downstream effects And while the work of shows the impossibility of simultaneously satisfying these fairness criteria in our setting we show that they are often impossible to satisfy even in isolation Our paper also fits into an older line of work studying economic models of discrimination and affirmative action which has its modern roots in and For example Coate and Loury and Foster and Vohra study two stage models in which students from two different groups who are a-priori identical can in the first stage choose whether or not to make a costly investment in themselves which will increase their value to employers In the nd stage employers may set a hiring rule that acts on a noisy signal about student quality These works show the existence of a self-confirming equilibrium in which only one group makes investments in themselves and are subsequently given employment opportunities and consider interventions which can escape these discriminatory equilibria These works can be viewed as studying the upstream effects of affirmative action policies and explaining the mechanics by which different student populations may end up with different type distributions The effect of the interventions proposed in these models is very slow because it requires a new generation of students to recognize the opportunities made available to them via affirmative action policies and make costly investments in their education in response well before they enter the job market In contrast our work can be viewed as studying the downstream effects of these policies and examining shorter term effects which can be realized in a time frame that need not be long enough for type distributions to change More recently the computer science community has begun studying fairness desiderata in dynamic models Jabbari et al study the costs measured as their effect on the rate of learning of imposing fairness constraints on learners in general Markov decision processes Hu and Chen study a dynamic model of the labor market similar to that of in which two populations are symmetric but can choose to exert costly effort in order to improve their value to an employer They study a two stage model of a labor market in which interventions in a temporary labor market can lead to high welfare symmetric equilibrium in the long run Liu et al study a two round model of lending in which lending decisions in the first round can change the type distribution of applicants in the nd round according to a known exogenously specified function They study how statistical constraints on the lending rule can improve or harm outcomes as compared to a myopic ie ignoring dynamic effects profit maximizing rule and find that for two kinds of interventions both improvement and harm are possible depending on the details of how lending effects the type distribution Finally studied the regulators problem of providing financial incentives for a lender to satisfy fairness constraints in an online classification setting MODEL We consider two populations of students and In population i each student has a type drawn from a Gaussian distribution Pi N with mean and variance i Since our problem is trivial if P P in this paper we assume always that P P ie the type distributions differ either in their mean or their variance or both We denote the random variable that represents the type of a student from population i Throughout the paper denotes the probability density function and the cumulative density function of a standard normal random variable with mean and variance Each student takes a standardized test SAT etc and obtains a score given by Si Ti X where X follows a normal distribution with mean and variance that does not depend on the population i ie the students score is a noisy but unbiased estimate of his type Additionally we consider a university that admits students from both populations The university designs an admission rule Ai R for each population i such that a student from population i with score s is accepted with probability Ai s We also abuse notation and denote the binary random variable whose value is if a student is accepted and otherwise This admission rule is required to be monotone non-decreasing ie an increase in exam score cannot lead to a decrease in admissions probability We say that an admissions rule is deterministic if Ai s A deterministic monotone admissions rule is characterized by a threshold such that a student is accepted if and only if Si We call such rules-thresholding admissions rules We focus on thresholding admissions rules in the body of this paper but extend our results to probabilistic admissions rules to the Appendix For simplicity of notation we will often write xi t Pr Ai Ti t Note that xi t Pr Si Ti t in the deterministic case Every student who is admitted to the university receives a grade given by Gi Ti Y where Y follows a normal distribution with mean and variance that does not depend on the population i can be set by the university and represents the strength of the signal provided by a grading policy single grading policy to use across groups Finally an employer makes a hiring decision for each student that graduates from the university The employer knows the priors Pi the admission rules A A used by the school the grading policy and observes the grades of the students as well as the fact that they were admitted to the school The employers expected utility for accepting a university graduate from population i with grade is then given by E Ti Gi C is the cost for the employer to hire a student The employer hires a university graduate from population i with grade if and only if E Ti Gi C Throughout the paper we study the feasibility of achieving the following fairness goals Definition opportunity Equal opportunity holds if and only if the probability of a student being hired by the employer conditional on his type is independent of the students group Ie if for all types t R Pr G T tE T G Pr G T tE T G Definition Irrelevance of Group Membership Irrelevance of Group Membership IGM holds if and only if conditional on admission by the school and on grade the employers decision on whether to hire a student is independent of the students group Ie if for all grades R E T G C E T G C We further introduce a robust version of IGM called strong Irrelevance of Group Membership that symmetrizes the two populations and guarantees that members of both populations will be treated identically by rational decision makers at any further stage of the decision making pipeline Definition strong Irrelevance of Group Membership Strong Irrelevance of Group Membership sIGM holds if and only if conditional on admission by the school and on grade the employers one averages two normally distributed random variables the result is also normally distributed but with lower variance Hence one way to modulate the variance of a grade signal is to modulate the number of grades computed The more assignments and exams that are graded the lower the variance of the signal The fewer that are graded the higher the variance posterior on a students type is independent of the students population Ie for all R for all t R Pr T t G Pr T t G We note that sIGM holds if and only if the posterior on students types conditional on admission by the school are identical Claim sIGM holds if and only if for all t R Pr T t A Pr T t A Proof See Appendix INFERENCE PRELIMINARIES In this section we derive some basic properties of the joint distributions on student types exam scores admissions rules and grades that are relevant for reasoning about the employers Bayesian inference task We will draw upon these basic results in the coming sections Preliminaries on Gaussians and Multivariate Gaussians First we observe that together student types exam scores and grades are distributed according to a multi-variate Gaussian Claim Ti Si Gi follows a multivariate normal distribution Proof A set of random variables is distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution if every linear combination of the variables is distributed as a univariate normal distribution For all ab c R a b follows a normal distribution as the sum of independent normal random variables We now quote a basic fact about the conditional distribution that results when one starts with a multi-variate normal distribution and conditions on the realization of a subset of its coordinates Claim be an integer be a random variable following a multi-variate normal distribution Let Z where R ni with n n n Suppose Z has where mi R ni and covariance matrix where Then E Z Z z m and Z Z z Proof See lecture notes The following technical lemma will also be useful for us Claim The hazard rate x of a standard normal random variable is increasing and satisfies lim x x x x ox This is a commonly known result in the literature on probability theory and statistics For completeness we provide a proof in the Appendix Employers First Moment Inference The main lemma of this section characterizes the employers Bayesian inference task when the college is using a threshold admissions rule the posterior expectation of a students type conditioned on their exam score being sufficiently high to cross the admissions threshold and on their observed grade In the appendix we give the corresponding inference rule for the employer when the college can use an arbitrary monotone admissions rule Lemma E Ti Si Gi i i i i i i i i i i i where x is the Hazard function of a standard normal random variable Proof The proof is given in Appendix A corollary of the previous lemma is that the posterior expectation computed by the employer will satisfy a number of nice regularity conditions which will be useful in proving our impossibility results Corollary E Ti Si Gi is continuous differentiable and strictly increasing in each of and Further lim lim and lim i i lim Proof See Appendix Finally we define a quantity that will be useful to make reference to in a number of our forthcoming arguments the minimum grade that results in a student from group i being hired by the employer given a fixed admissions rule Definition Hiring threshold on grades C E Ti Si Gi C the inverse function of E Ti Si Gi By Corollary is a well-defined function on domain R and is continuous differentiable and strictly increasing Moments of the posterior distribution for monotone admission rules The following lemma holds for the general case of monotone randomized admission rules and is useful in characterizing the moments of the distribution of types conditional on Ai and G in population i Lemma Let Ai be a non-decreasing non-zero possibly randomized admission rule For all R E T ki Gi is finite and differentiable in and its derivative satisfies the following equation T ki Gi T i Gi T ki Gi Ti Gi Proof The proof is given in Appendix WHEN BOTH CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIABLE In this section we observe that there are two settings in which it is possible to have it all satisfying both IGM and equal opportunity even in the multiple threshold case The first setting is that of noiseless exam scores when student types are perfectly observable by the school The second setting is when the school not to report grades We view the first setting as generally unrealisable since any student evaluation will involve some degree of stochasticity However the nd case in which a school not to report grades can be realized Noiseless Exam Scores Observable Types First we observe that if schools can perfectly observe student types we have noiseless exam scores with Si Ti then there is a simple threshold admissions rule that simultaneously achieves IGM and equal opportunity even in the multiple threshold case The ideas is simple Given a range of employer costs CC the college simply sets an admissions threshold or higher using the same threshold for members of both groups Because the threshold is the same for both groups the probability of being admitted to college is a function only of type and independent of group membership conditioned on type Because scores were noiseless admissions to college deterministically certifies that a students type ti C and so the employer chooses to hire everyone independently of the grade they receive and independently of their group membership Hence the probability of being hired is the same as the probability of being accepted to college and is independent of group membership conditioned on type and the employers hiring rule is independent of group membership Claim Suppose Si Ti ie a students score perfectly reveals his type Then for any hiring interval of hiring costs CC R the non-zero admissions rule Ai s s C for both groups i satisfies IGM and equal opportunity when paired with any grading policy Proof See Appendix Claim Suppose the school does not assign grades to students Then for any hiring interval of hiring costs CC R the non-zero thresholding admissions rule Ai s s for both groups i satisfies IGM and equal opportunity when is large enough Proof For big enough E Ti Si C as E Ti Si this can be seen either by following the same steps as in the proof of Lemma to obtain that E Ti Si i i i which tends to when by Claim Another way of deriving this expression is by noting that not having a grade is equivalent to having an uninformative grade ie to Now let be large enough such that in both populations such that E Ti Si C IGM immediately holds as every student that is accepted by the school is hired by the employer Equal opportunity holds because the probability of a student with type t being hired by the employer is exactly the probability that he is admitted by the school every student admitted by the school is hired by the employer hence is given by Pr Si Ti t and is independent of the students population Note that this result is achieved by having the school set a very high admissions threshold uniformly for both groups and declining to give grades Hence declining to give grades may be a reasonable strategy for promoting our fairness goals in a highly selective school but does not work when admissions thresholds must be lower We note that the practice of grade witholding in MBA programs seems to be limited to the very top programs In the remainder of the paper we consider the case in which exam scores have positive finite variance and in which the college uses a grading policy with positive finite variance What will be possible will depend on whether we are in the single or multiple threshold case THE SINGLE THRESHOLD CASE In this section we consider what is possible when there is only a single employer with a hiring cost C that is known to the college We show that in this case IGM can always be achieved but that it is impossible to achieve sIGM IGM can always be achieved The main idea is as follows For any grading scheme and with a single threshold C in mind the college can separately set different admissions thresholds such that the posterior expectation for a student type from each group crosses the threshold at a which can be made to be the same for both populations Since the only thing that matters in the employers hiring decision is whether or not the students expected type is above or below C this is enough to cause the employers hiring decision to be independent of group membership The next lemma establishes that it is always possible to find such thresholds Lemma For any C in R there exists thresholds grade such that E T G S E T G S C Proof It follows by Corollary that E Ti Gi Si is continuous in and must reach any value between i i i i i i hence there exists such that E Ti Gi Si C Corollary Fix any C in R When the school uses thresholding admission rules with thresholds Proof E Ti Gi Si is a strictly increasing function of by Corollary therefore the employer accepts students from any population if and only is population-independent which proves the results sIGM is impossible We now show that strong IGM-making the posterior distributions for both groups identical is impossible In addition to its intrinsic interest this result will be a key ingredient in our impossibility results for the multiple threshold setting Lemma Suppose the priors are distinct For any two thresholds and there must exists t R such that Pr T t S Pr T t S Ie sIGM cannot hold Proof Let xi t Pr Si Ti t Suppose for all t R sIGM holds ie Pr T t S Pr T t S by Claim Then Pr S Pr S hence Pr S Pr S t t x and x are non-decreasing functions with values in and xi t is non-zero therefore xi t exists and is strictly positive It must then be the case that has a finite and strictly positive limit in On the other hand t t t t for some constant It is easy to see that the above quantity tends to either or as t as long as either or one of contradiction Equal opportunity We defer the technical results of this section to the Appendix Lemma shows that for thresholding admission rules IGM and equal opportunity cannot simultaneously hold for Gaussian priors with the same variance but different mean This shows that obtaining fairness in the general case is significantly more difficult than in the simple cases in which the types are observable and the school does not assign grades Lemma shows that arguably stringent conditions on the grade accuracy and the thresholds set by the school must hold for equal opportunity to be possible We conjecture that these conditions are in general impossible to satisfy making equal opportunity impossible to satisfy even in isolation in the single threshold case As we will see in the next section it is impossible to satisfy in the multiple-threshold case THE MULTIPLE THRESHOLD CASE In this section we turn to the multiple threshold case which we view as the main setting of interest In this case we ask whether we can achieve IGM and equal opportunity not just with respect to a single known hiring cost C but with respect to an entire interval of hiring costs C CC This will be the case when there are multiple employers or simply when there is some uncertainty about the hiring threshold used by a single employer IGM is Impossible In this section we show that IGM is impossible to achieve even in isolation The proof proceeds by showing that in the multiple threshold case IGM must imply sIGM ie that the posterior distributions conditional on admission to college are identical for both groups Impossibility then follows from the impossibility of achieving sIGM even for a single threshold which we proved in the last section We first state a technical lemma showing that if we satisfy IGM for every employer in a continuous interval we must actually be equalizing the posterior expected type across groups for every grade in some other continuous interval Claim Let C C Suppose that for all C C C E T G S C E T G S C then it must be the case that for in some interval ab E T G S E T G S Proof Let a and b increasing inverse of E T G as per Claim and Definition Suppose there exists ab such that E T A G E T A G then E T A G C C it must be the case that E T A G C E T A G which contradicts the assumption of the claim Now suppose there exists ab such that E T A G E T A G then for small E T A G C C and E T A G C E T A G which also contradicts the assumption of the claim Therefore it must be the case that for all ab E T A G E T A G We can now go on to prove the main theorem in this section Theorem Suppose the priors are distinct then IGM cannot for all hiring costs C C C Proof By Claim it must be the case that for all ab for some interval T G S E T G S For all in ab by Lemma E T G S E T G S and hence E T E T It is easy to see that using the same argument by induction yields that for all integers E T E T Since the distributions of types for the two populations conditional on Gi Si admit a moment generating function this follows immediately from the fact that Pi admits a moment generating function and have identical moments it must be that the distributions are the same for all ab Ie for all ab we have Pr T t G S Pr T t G S We have that in population i Pr Ti t Gi Si Pr Ti t Si t Pr Ti t Si dt Note that t Pr Ti t Si dt is a function of only that we will denote pi from now on Pr T t G S Pr T t G S implies Pr T t S Pr T t S for ab and t R Pr T t S and Pr T t S are both probability density functions that integrate to so it must be the case that and Pr T t S Pr T t S Therefore sIGM must hold which we have shown is impossible in Lemma Equal opportunity cannot hold Finally we show that in the multiple threshold case it is also impossible to satisfy the equal opportunity condition Theorem Suppose the priors are distinct There exist no thresholding admission rules such that equal opportunity is guaranteed for all C C C for any C C Proof It is easy to see xi t s Ai u Ai u is monotone non-decreasing in t and non-zero Remember E Ti Gi Si has a strictly increasing and differentiable on by Corollary and a student is hired by the employer if and only if C A student with type t in population i gets therefore hired with probability xi t dt xi t C t equal opportunity then imply that t RC C C Taking the first order derivative in C of both sides of the above equation we have that for all C C C for all t R Suppose for some C C C renumber the populations such that that t and we know that is a strictly increasing function so so it must be the case that lim t Since is upper-bounded by this implies in particular that as t which contradicts x being a non-zero non-decreasing function Hence it must be the case that for all C C C impossible CONCLUSION We consider two natural fairness goals that a college might have for its affirmative action policies granting equal opportunity to individuals with the same type when graduating from high school independent of their group membership and incentivizing downstream employers to make hiring decisions that are independent of group membership We show that these goals can be simultaneously achieved by highly selective colleges ie those with very high admissions thresholds but only if they do not report grades to employers This provides another view on this practice which is followed by several highly selective MBA programs On the other hand we find that these goals are generally unachievable even in isolation if schools report informative grades These impossibility results crucially hinge on the fact that exam scores and grades provide only noisy signals about student types and hence require rational expectation maximizers to reason about prior type distributions which can vary by group Our paper leaves open a natural technical question can a college set admissions and informative grading policies to realize the equal opportunity condition in the single threshold case We conjecture that the answer to this question is no and in the Appendix we give a theorem supporting this conjecture ruling out the possibility for deterministic admissions rules in every case except when the grading variance is exactly Finally a natural question left open by our work is quantifying the extent to which approximate notions of our fairness goals are achievable and at what cost For example can one guarantee that the ratio of the probabilities of a positive outcome between two students with the same type but from different populations is close to For students with the same grade Given a constraint on the ratio what is the most equal representation in the college class that we can guarantee for the two populations
