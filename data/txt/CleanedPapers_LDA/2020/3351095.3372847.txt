Fairness and Utilization in Allocating Resources with Uncertain Demand Resource allocation problems are a fundamental domain in which to evaluate the fairness properties of algorithms The trade-offs between fairness and utilization have a long history in this domain A recent line of work has considered fairness questions for resource allocation when the demands for the resource are distributed across multiple groups and drawn from probability distributions In such cases a natural fairness requirement is that individuals from different groups should have approximately equal probabilities of receiving the resource A largely open question in this area has been to bound the gap between the maximum possible utilization of the resource and the maximum possible utilization subject to this fairness condition Here we obtain some of the rst provable upper bounds on this gap We obtain an upper bound for arbitrary distributions as well as much stronger upper bounds for specific families of distributions that are typically used to model levels of demand In particular we nd somewhat surprisingly that there are natural families of distributions including Exponential and Weibull for which the gap is non-existent it is possible to simultaneously achieve maximum utilization and the given notion of fairness Finally we show that for power-law distributions there is a non-trivial gap between the solutions but this gap can be bounded by a constant factor independent of the parameters of the distribution CONCEPTS Theory of computation Design and analysis of algorithms Computing methodologies Planning under uncertainty KEYWORDS resource allocation algorithmic fairness uncertainty Weibull distribution power law distribution INTRODUCTION The current interest in fairness properties of algorithms includes several distinct themes one of which is the question of fairness in allocating scarce resources Research on this question has a long history with foundational work in the s and s on allocating resources in computer systems Allocation problems continue to form an important topic for fairness considerations especially as automated systems make allocation decisions in a wide range of areas that reach far beyond the original computational settings of the problem Recently Elzayn et al considered a novel allocation problem in this style In their formulation individuals are divided into groups each of which has some probability distribution of candidates who desire the resource There is a fixed amount of resource R and the question is how to allocate this resource across the groups Such a set-up arises in many applications as one concrete motivating example for purposes of discussion suppose that we have a set number of doctors each with a maximum number of people they can assist and we would like to allocate them across a set of N geographically distributed regions Each region contains a population with a potentially different probability distribution over the number of sick people in need of doctors We know the distribution of demand for each region but we will only know the actual demand drawn from these distributions once we have allocated the doctors by dividing them up in some fashion across the regions If a community has too few doctors some sick people will go unassisted and if a community has more doctors than it needs for the number of sick people it has some of the doctors capacity to help will go unused Formally the expected number of candidates that receive a resource under a certain allocation is called the utilization of that allocation One allocation strategy could be to put the doctors where they are most likely to be used with the aim of maximizing utilization However such an allocation could potentially starve certain regions leaving them with very few doctors even though they have a non-trivial level of need Such an allocation violates a natural definition of fairness sick people in some regions would have a higher probability of receiving assistance than sick people in other regions which conflicts with the premise that people are equally deserving of care from the doctors In this work we thus say that an allocation is fair across multiple regions if a candidate who needs the resource has the same probability of receiving it regardless of the region they belong to the identity of the region doesnt impact the probability that those in need obtain assistance At some points we relax this definition slightly to say that an allocation is -fair if the probability that a candidate receives the resource in different regions is within a maximum difference of for across all of the regions Note that corresponds to our initial notion of fairness and imposes no constraint at all on the allocation Elzayn et al consider a version of this allocation problem in the scenario where the candidate probability distributions are unknown and must be learned At each time step a certain allocation is chosen and the feedback obtained reveals only the number of candidates who received the resource not the true number They adapt learning results from previous dark pool trading scenarios proposed in Ganchev et al From these results they construct algorithms that learn utilization-maximizing and -fair utilization maximizing allocations through this type of censored feedback They also define the Price of Fairness as the ratio of the utilizations of the max-utilizing allocation and the max-utilizing -fair allocation From an empirical dataset they calculate the for various levels of in practice However they leave largely open the following category of questions can we obtain theoretical upper bounds on the price of fairness over different probability distributions These questions appear to become quite complex even when the distributions are known The present work The interaction of fairness and utilization In this work we obtain bounds on the price of fairness for this family of resource allocation problems both through general results that hold for all distributions and through stronger results that are specific to common families of distributions We also distinguish between two versions of the problem one in which we require that the allocation to each group be integer-valued and one in which we allow resources to be allocated fractionally or probabilistically which yields equivalent results in expectation In the case of integer-valued resource allocation we show through a constructive proof that the can be unboundedly large If we allow resources to be allocated fractionally then we show that the is bounded above by for arbitrary distributions and In the case where the can be unboundedly large for fractional allocations as well We then show that much stronger upper bounds can be obtained for large families of distributions that are often used to model levels of demand First we show that certain families of natural distributions have equal to the smallest possible bound for these distributions there is no trade-off between fairness and maximum utilization We show that distributions with this property include Exponential and Weibull distributions We then consider the family of Power Law distributions for a constant number of groups we show that these distributions have a that can be strictly greater than but is always bounded above by a universal constant Table in Appendix A contains a high-level summary of results explored in this paper Overall our results reveal a rich picture in the trade-off between fairness and utilization for this type of allocation problem through the different families of bounds for the price of fairness ranging from distributions where perfect fairness can be achieved while maximizing utilization to those in which the gap is bounded by a constant to others for which the gap can be large The techniques used for the analysis suggest further opportunities for reasoning They consider a related but different definition of fairness from the one used in this work Later sections will expand on this difference about how balancing the probability of service to different groups can both constrain and also be compatible with other objectives Important limitations The assumptions and limitations of this model are discussed in greater detail in Section However it is worth emphasizing some of the specific choices inherent in creating this model In particular the notion of fairness that this paper uses is equality in the chance of obtaining a resource conditional on needing it Although we describe in the next section why this is a natural definition of fairness to use it is certainly not the only possible definition of fairness and alternative definitions could lead to different results For example a notion of fairness could take into account historical discrepancies in resources between locations and attempt to proactively rectify them Another fundamental assumption of this work is that there is a fixed amount of resources available to distribute An alternative viewpoint could be to explore ways to increase the total amount of resources so that more people in need are able to obtain help Increasing available resources is a critical goal and one where advocacy and political action can play a key role in bringing this about for real-world allocation problems However in almost all cases it is only feasible to reduce not fully eliminate unmet need Thus even after the overall level of resources have been increased fair resource allocation will still be a problem that needs to be addressed In this way we view both increasing the total amount of resources and fair resource allocation as important and complementary areas of study in most cases neither eliminates the need for the other MOTIVATING EXAMPLE To motivate the problem and to make some of the types of calculations more clear we start with the following example Suppose there is a remote stretch of coastline with two small villages A and B each with a small number of houses This stretch of coastline is prone to severe localized storms that lead to power outages Each village has a slightly different probability distribution over storms distributions that are known In any particular week the probability distribution over the number of houses C impacted by power outages in each village is as follows PAC c c c otherwise PB C c c c otherwise In our example assume that each weeks power outage is independent of other weeks and the villages are far enough apart that the power outages in one village arent correlated with the power outages in the other A regional planning committee has at its disposal generators each of which can restore power to house They are trying to decide how to allocate these generators across the two villages The generators cannot be transferred from one village to another after a storm strikes If there are generators allocated to a village and c houses in need of generators the number of houses that receive generators in that village is min c We include this example only as a motivating case for our broader model we do not intend that this model apply exclusively to disaster relief allocation However we do wish to make it clear that maximizing utilization and fairness in disaster relief resource allocation is an active area of study AB min CA min CB U AB min min min min min min min min min min min min Table Utilization of resources across two groups in motivating example The regional planning committee rst decides that it wishes to maximize utilization the expected number of houses in need of generators that receive them There are three options for allocations A B A B A B where i means that village i gets generators Formally utilization can be written as U A nAB nB min min The utilizations across these three allocations are given in Table The allocation that maximizes utilization is A B However something bothers the regional committee it feels fundamentally unfair that none of the houses in village A ever receive generators To formalize this we could ask what fraction of houses in need of generators obtain them on average and aim to select an allocation that brings this proportion between the two villages as close to equality as possible First we derive the relevant probability for an arbitrary village P house gets generator house needs generator P house gets generator house needs generator p house needs generator p house gets generator p house needs generator We assume that there is a total number of houses in the village and that all houses within the same village are interchangable The total number of houses in the village that need generators is given by C C Given that c houses need generators there is a c probability that a randomly selected house will be in need Given that a house is in need the probability it obtains a generator equals min c p house needs generator equals c p house needs generator C c PC c c c PC c c c PC c Similarly we can use term to expand p house gets generator Pk gets generator needs generator Pk needs generator Pk gets generator does NOT need generator Pk does NOT need generator p house gets generator house does NOT need generator We expand the remaining term by conditioning on C The sum AB CB CB U AB Table Probability of receiving resources across two groups in motivating example Utilization included for reference starts from c because if c there are houses in need of generators c Pk gets generator needs generator C c Pk needs generator C c c min c c PC c Combining these results gives p house gets generator p house needs generator c min c c PC c c PC c c min c c PC c c PC c c min c c PC c min c where in the last step we have defined the probability of receiving the resource conditional on needing it as where i indexes the village Note that this definition differs from Elzayn et al that definition calculated the probability of candidates receiving the resource weighted by each time period By contrast our definition is based on the per-person probability of receiving the resource which we believe is a more natural definition One goal might be to bring these probabilities across the villages to be as close as possible to each other How does each allocation considered in Table do under this definition For reference and The results are shown in Table Given these numbers the regional committee could look at the utilization and fairness of each allocation and make their own decision about how resources should be allocated In particular they might decide that they want the fractions between each village to be within a certain difference and pick the allocation with maximal utilization subject to those constraints It is this scenario that much of this paper will consider comparing max-utilization with max-utilization subject to an -fairness constraint APPLICATIONS AND FORMAL MODEL Our model is best described as a two-stage stochastic problem in which resource allocation decisions are made in the rst stage and demand is drawn probabilistically in the second stage We envision our work being used in the following way Suppose that the group identity is associated with some decomposition of the population into groups whether by geographic location or socioeconomic status or attributes like race or ethnicity such that we wish for resources to be fairly distributed across these groups In this case the bound could be used to provide a general sense of the maximum trade-off between utilization and fairness that a decisionmaker might need to face The purpose of this paper is not to provide guidance for which allocation decision-makers should choose but rather to provide general bounds on when this procedure will result in a large trade-off of utilization and fairness and when the trade-off will be smaller Much of this paper will focus on cases with many candidates and many resources which in the limit will be be approximated by continuous probability distributions This approximation is common in many application areas in social sciences it is known that certain phenomena are well-described by power law and exponential distributions even when their exact parameters might be unclear We have focused much of our analysis on these distributions with the goal that our results can be maximally useful Model detail In this section we make the motivating example more abstract We assume a set of N groups Each group i has a distribution over the number of candidates C that are present during a particular unit of time We assume that ECCiC i N and i and that each time periods number of candidates is independently and identically distributed Much of this paper will focus on the continuous probability distribution case but the results obtained largely do not depend on this factor In the model we assume we have a number R N of resources that we can allocate across these groups We assume that allocations must be selected before the number of candidates is realized each time period If resources and c candidates are present a given group then min c candidates will receive the resource If c some resources will go unused and if c some candidates will go without resources We assume that the only distinguishing characteristic candidates have is which group they come from otherwise they are interchangeable We have two different objectives utilization and fairness Utilization U v B N i min Fairness B max i with qC B min c The fairness term bounds the difference between groups in the probability of a candidate receiving a resource An allocation v is fair if the fairness objective has value so all fractions are within of each other Next we define the Price of Fairness Unconstrained utilization Maximum utilization that is -fair max v st i i R max v st and i i R If there exists an allocation that simultaneously maximizes utilization and is fair then the is and there is no tension between our two objectives Otherwise the is and we will need to trade o between these objectives in order to make a decision about which allocation to choose We will use the standard notation of having x represent the probability density function or probability mass function of a distribution and x represent the cumulative distribution function Assumptions There are a few assumptions in this model that are important to recognize To start we require that any allocation always use its entire budget R It might be possible that an -fair allocation might prefer to use less than its entire budget in order to achieve fairness this is a case that our model specifically disallows Additionally it would often be the case that increasing the budget R would make it easier to achieve any given fairness metric We prove in Lemma that increasing the budget only improves fairness and utilization metrics but overall the area of increasing or decreasing the available resources is not the focus of this paper Secondly our definition of fairness revolves around the maximum difference in probability of receiving the resource A different metric could have used the average difference in probability for example A more ambitious multi-time period extension could take into account historical differences in resource allocation and have a fairness metric that attempts to rectify past inequalities While these and other different models might also be valid and interesting future avenues to explore they would all be built on the necessary foundation this paper provides The rest of this paper will use the assumptions and model listed above Application areas Despite the motivating example in Section the focus of this paper is not to model any one specific application such as disaster relief aid Instead we view this model as representing the core features of allocation problems in a variety of contexts A few of these are listed below Doctors As described in the introduction one example could be allocating doctors across regions with different probabilities of ill patients It is worth noting that the presence of doctors would likely influence the level of illnesses Blood banks Donated blood needs to be allocated across different hospitals with potentially different needs for blood This area has the added complication that blood donations are not interchangeable candidates can only receive a certain subset of the available types of blood Schools A public school district might try to allocate certain resources teachers computers specialized classes across schools of different size and therefore different distributions of need We have noted that in each case the potential application area would have key features that are not already captured in the above model This is intentional because the goal of this paper is to provide broad results for a broad class of problems Both Elzayn et al and Ensign et al use related models in the contexts of allocating police officers to districts with differing crime rates While this is also an area of application for this model it raises additional issues that we do not model here such as the likelihood that the presence of police officers will have an impact on the rate of crime Fairness in resource allocation work has been studied in various application areas For example study the issue of fair allocation of bandwidth speed of service and buffer space in networking These works differ from ours in the selected model it is assumed that actors can modify the amount of resources requested at will which differs from our probabilistic resource generation method Wang et al n d studies the specific case of disaster relief aid In this case it is assumed that the amount of need is determined before the allocation decision needs to be made which again differs from our model GENERAL BOUNDS ON PRICE OF FAIRNESS One natural question we might ask is What is the maximum amount of utilization we give up by requiring fairness This amount depends on the set of demand distributions and our budget R If we have these quantities we can directly calculate the by rst calculating the unconstrained max-utilization then the -fair max-utilization Elzayn et al provides algorithms to calculate both of these quantities so long as the allocations are integers However in many cases we might not know the specific in advance but we might still want to have a bound on the In this section we explore general bounds on the when we do not know the candidate distributions in advance Discrete resource allocation has unbounded Suppose we allocate resources in integer units for example one generator at a time In this formulation we nd that the is unbounded achieving fairness could require giving up arbitrarily large amounts of utilization This proof is presented in detail in Appendix B A rough sketch is below Suppose we are given a desired and a maximum we are willing to accept We require because if the fairness constraint has no effect so the will be always Then it is possible to construct a set of candidate distributions and a set of resources R over this such that the is The proof involves creating two different candidate distributions with parameters depending on and and then showing that the of allocating resources across those groups is always bounded by under fractional allocation A critical reader might wonder about the if we were allowed to allocate resources fractionally Such allocations would oer more exibility and might allow for lower In the motivating example of allocating generators across villages for example this might correspond to allocating generators to Village A and generators to Village B For divisible resources such as potable water stores this type of allocation makes intuitive sense For indivisible resources like generators we can view the allocation as probabilistic An allocation of for example could be viewed as a chance of and a chance of The expected utilization is equal to min V C Both the deterministic fractional and probabilistic integer-valued interpretations give in the same expected utilization proven in Appendix B We will switch between these two interpretations probabilistic and deterministic depending on which makes more sense for the problem at hand Given the ability to allocate resources fractionally we will nd that the is no longer unbounded In particular the is upper bounded by Note that this proof relies on an algorithm to calculate a max-utilizing allocation in the fractional case as well as other related proofs all present in Appendix C T Given a set of candidate distributions level of resources R and ability to allocate resources fractionally it is possible to nd an -fair allocation with at most though this allocation may not use all of the resources P First we nd a max-utilization allocation and divide the groups into two categories A i B i If A then the max-utilization allocation is already -fair and Otherwise modify the allocation i i A so q i exactly We are able to do this because we know that is continuous proven in Appendix B and increases monotonically from to This new allocation is -fair It uses at most the same amount of resources that the optimal allocation used so it is achievable The only case where it uses exactly the same amount of resources is when A is the empty set For i A we know that q i min c i min c i min This shows that the utilization of the groups in A is greater than or equal to multiplied by the utilization of the unconstrained maximum utilization The utilization of groups in B is identical to their unconstrained utilization because their allocation has not been changed Then i A min i B min i A min c i i B min i A min i B min A min i B min i A min A min where the inequality in the second to last step comes from the fact that B could be the empty set Note that we have required that all allocations use all of the resources so we will need to convert the allocation calculated above into one with i i R The supporting lemma below proved in the Appendix provides this final step L If there exists a fractional allocation v over candidate distributions C such that i i V R that is -fair there also exists an allocation v that is -fair and has utilization at least as large as v but additionally has the property that i i R Taken together these two lemmas show that for every optimal allocation we can nd an allocation that is -fair uses all of the resources R and has less that This tells us that the for the max-utilization -fair allocation could be at most for unbounded for under fractional allocation However this bound is undefined for The proof below shows that we can achieve arbitrarily high with only n groups even in the case where we increase the budget R by a constant factor in the case L Suppose that in the case requiring allocation the budget R is multiplied by For any we can create a set of n groups such that requiring fairness involves a assuming fractional allocation of resources P We create groups one with distribution C and one with distribution C described below C C PC c p c p c n otherwise C C PC c p c p c n otherwise Set p p p n n n and n Finally set R n Because p p candidates are more likely to be present in Group so the optimal allocation is n The fair allocation has qC qC In the case that i ni the q probabilities can be calculated as follows mini C i pi ni pi i ni As stated above this equation only holds for i ni If i ni always However we must have i ni in the fair allocation we have insufficient resources to have qC qC This implies that n n R n where we have incorporated the fact that the budget is times larger The solution to this system of equations is n n n n n n n n This gives us a as follows p n n n p n n p p n p n p p n n where we have used the fact that n n Simplifying further gives p n p n p n p p n p n p Using the facts that p p n and n the bound becomes p n p n as desired Note that p is left as a free parameter In particular it could be set to something decreasing in such as This demonstrates that even in the case of tail probabilities decreasing in it is still possible to create an example with greater than EQUAL TO FOR CERTAIN FAMILIES OF DISTRIBUTIONS The previous section showed that with fractional allocation the upper bound on the Price of Fairness is This could still be a large price to pay if the desired level of fairness is this could mean we might be obliged to reduce utilization by in order to achieve the desired level of equity Depending on the context this could be a very high tradeoff However the upper bound obtained in the previous section was derived without any reliance on the characteristics of the candidate distributions C In this section we will show that for certain reasonable distributions the Price of Fairness is much lower In some cases the max-utilization allocation is already fair Illustrative example for exponential distribution First we will work out an example illustrating this phenomenon for N groups both with exponential distributions As proved in Appendix C for this case there exists only one max-utilizing allocation which has with R This can be written as e e R which implies R and R This allocation was calculated to be max-utilizing We will also show that it is fair which means that To do this we will calculate for both groups In general qC c c e e e Then we know that qC qC because e R e R This demonstrates that for the given scenario the max-utilizing allocation already satisfies fairness However this property is true more broadly than just in this illustrative example In the next section we will describe a property of probability distributions such that the max-utilizing allocation is also fair Proof of general property T Consider a set of continuous candidate distributions with and Suppose the set of candidate distributions has the following property Fj C C i Then under fractional allocation of resources the max-utilization allocation is already fair In other words i i Fj min C min C Intuitively this property means that the CDFs of all of the candidate distributions are versions of the same function scaled by the ratio of their expected values If this property holds it will turn out mathematically that the max-utilizing allocation is already fair First we can verify that the exponential distribution satisfies these properties The exponential distribution has the given expectation and CDF C C Fj e Substitution shows that the premise of the lemmas above holds Fj C C e ij e i Next we will explore why this property of probability distributions leads to As shown in Appendix C the max-utilization allocation has the property that i only if In this case i i otherwise We require so i i We additionally require which tells us that there exists only one max-utilizing allocation Next we examine the fairness constraint and rewrite it as C C i Pi C i C i Pi C i C C C Pj C C Pj C C i For notational convenience we denote mi C C We will prove this theorem by considering subterms of each side independently and proving that they are equal L Fj mi i Pi C C mi Pj C mi C i P mi Pj C mi C mi Pi C C Pi C mi C Pi C C where the rst step comes from the fact that Pj C mi Fj mi Pi C The max-utilizing allocation has the property that i Fj Having the additional property that Fj mi implies that i mi This allows us to rewrite the above lemma in terms of the max-utilizing allocations i Fj i Pi C i C Pj C C Next we consider the second subterm in the equality L Fj mi i C C i Pi C i C C C Pj C C P What is C written out in terms of the CDF of a distribution We will consider C C as a different probability distribution It has PDF and CDF as shown below t t t otherwise t t t otherwise We can rewrite one of the terms above as C t dt We will use this fact to evaluate the following term substituting mi as the input C C Fj mi C mi Fj Fj mi Fj mi C Fj mi mi Fj mi Fj mi Fj mi C Fj mi mi Fj mi C mi Fj C where we have used the assumption of equality in the CDFs in the last step Next we note that Fj t t where t mi t By the reverse chain rule b a t Here t mi so if we denote the anti-derivative of by Hi Hi t Hi mi t Hi Hi This allows us to rewrite the item above as C This gives a value for the righthand side of the equality we are trying to show For the lefthand side we use results of our previous analysis of C to nd that the two terms are equivalent C C C C C Taken together these two lemmas tell us that Fj mi min C min C i so any max-utilization allocation is already fair Distributions that satisfy the given premise We have previously shown that exponential distributions satisfy the given premise which is perhaps not very surprising Exponential distributions have certain nice properties they are memoryless for example and are not heavy-tailed At rst guess it could be reasonable to guess that this phenomenon of equal to is only present in exponential distributions However there exist further families of distributions that also satisfy the premise above and therefore have equal to these include Weibull distributions with the same parameter They have expectation and CDF as given below C C i Fj e Again substitution shows that the premise of the above lemmas holds Fj C C e e i Thus the theorem proved in this section shows that Weibull distributions with the same parameter have This result is somewhat surprising given that Weibull distributions in general have fewer nice properties than exponential distributions However Weibull distributions along with power law distributions which will be discussed in the next section tend to be better models of real-life phenomena For example natural disasters and terrorist attacks are commonly believed to follow heavy-tailed distributions in severity This result shows us that there are plausibly realistic models of natural phenomena that have no trade-off between fair and max-utilizing allocations BOUNDED BY SMALL CONSTANT FOR POWER LAW DISTRIBUTION So far Section has shown that can be arbitrarily large and Section has shown that multiple distributions have A next logical step is to explore probability distributions with small gaps between the max-utilizing and -fair max utilizing allocations specifically we consider power law distributions There are multiple distributions that are commonly described as power law distributions The one we will use also called the Lomax distribution has PDF and CDF as below Note that it has support for all x and a parameter b controlling its shape fC b b FC b T Set the number of groups N to some constant Then the Price of Fairness from allocating R resources across these groups is upper bounded by where is the harmonic number Note that this bound is independent of the fairness parameter as well as the budget R and any distribution parameters bi We will prove this theorem by breaking it up into several smaller lemmas For convenience we order the groups so that b b bh First we write out the full term Unconstrained max-utilization Utilization constrained to be -fair i i x i i i i i x i i i As proved in Appendix C because the power law distribution has positive support everywhere in the space we are considering it has a unique max-utilizing allocation and -fair max-utilizing allocation The is largest when so that is the case we will upper-bound We will denote the unconstrained max-utilization allocations by i and the -fair allocations by i for i L i R hi i P As proved in Appendix C the max-utilizing allocation i has the property that i Fj i For the power law distributions this property can be written as i bi bj For bi bj this implies i so Any max-utilizing allocation over power law distributions of this form must use the entire resource R because the support of the distribution continues to any allocation using R resources can be strictly improved by allocating the remaining resources This tells us that R We can prove the upper bound by working backwards from R because the allocation to any one group cannot exceed the total amount of resources available and together both of them cannot sum to more than R so R Similarly for any i i i with i i R so i R hi L R P As proved in Appendix B any -fair allocation vi i i R can be increased to an -fair allocation vi with i and no decrease in utilization This tells us that the -fair max-utilizing allocation must use all of the resources so R Under the definition of x C b bb b b b For we require q i q i which can be written as i bi bj ibi For bi bj this implies i sum up toR and is the largest of them wemust have R While Lemma produces bounds for i i Lemma only bounds the case The following lemma will demonstrate that other bounds arent necessary since we can rewrite all of the -fair utilization in terms of L The -fair max-utilizing allocation can be rewritten entirely in terms of i i i i bh i Fh P fairness requires q i q Ch which can be written i x i i x fh Fh Simple rearrangement shows that i x i i is equal to bh bi x fh Fh This procedure could be repeated to obtain rewritten terms for every i term with i The above lemma allows us to rewrite the entire term as i i x i i i bh i x fh Fh Next our approach for bounding the will be to bound each term within the sum in the numerator independently L where x fh Fh bh i x fh Fh P We can apply Lemmas and to obtain R and We additionally use the fact bi These facts allow us to bound the equation as bh bh Rh bh bh Rh bh Rh bh In the last step to over-bound we under-bounded a term in the denominator replacing bh i with At R this fraction is undefined We denote the numerator as s the denominator as t and use LHôpitals rule to investigate the limit as R We note that s bh and t bh Rh bh As R s bh and t bh so s t which tells us that as R Next we will show that is decreasing in R proving that is an upper bound on everywhere To do this we will use LHôpitals Monotone rule which states the following L Given a c and s t continuous functions differentiable on a c with sa ta or sc tc and x x a c then if s t is increasing decreasing on a c then s t is also increasing decreasing The functions in satisfy this rule s t are both continuous and differentiable and for a sa ta Using this rule s bh bh Rh bh R bh R R bh This term is decreasing in R because the denominator R is increasing faster than the numerator R is increasing This tells us that s t is decreasing in R so is decreasing as well The upper bound of R is an upper bound for all of Next we consider a bound for any i L For i hi where i x i i bh x fh Fh P Using bounds i R hi and R from Lemmas and we substitute and rewrite R hi bi bh bh Rh bh R hi bi bi Rh bh R hi bi bi bh Rh bh At R this is again undefined Using the same process of rewriting the fraction as s t we get s bi i R hi bi t bh bi R bh Using LHôpitals rule again as R s bi hi bi bh bi i bi i bh bi is decreasing in bi so this overall term is increasing in bi bi upper-bounds this fraction by hi hi which provides the limit as R Again we use LHôpitals Monotone rule to show that s t is decreasing in R and that the R upper bound is sufficient R This tells us that s t equals bi hi R hi bi Rh bh bi i bh bi R bh R hi bi The term in the denominator has a base that grows more quickly in R because R hi increases in R faster than R and a larger exponent because bi bh Because of this the denominator grows more quickly in R so s t is decreasing in R LHôpitals Monotone rule tells us that st is decreasing in R as well and so the over bound at R is an over bound for the entire function These lemmas taken together give us a bound for the overall in terms of the harmonic number i i We also investigated this bound empirically by directly calculating the for groups with different power law distributions We found that the is typically much lower than this theoretical bound frequently around This result tells us that in general the most max-utilizing allocations are already very close in utilization to fair solutions Overall this provides an optimistic outlook for resource allocation in the numerous real-world scenarios modeled by power law distributions CONCLUSION In this work we have analyze a problem in fair resource allocation from the recent literature Starting from a set of open questions around the relationship between fair allocations and maximum utilization allocations we obtained upper bounds on the gap between the utilization of optimal and fair solutions formalized as the Price of Fairness In addition to bounds for general distributions we showed that a number of natural families of distributions exhibit no gap at all there exist optimal allocations that also achieve perfect fairness guarantees Finally we established constant upper bounds for power-law distributions There are a number of further directions suggested by this work To begin with it would be interesting to try characterizing the set of distributions for which the Price of Fairness is equal to this is a fundamental distributional property that applies more broadly than it initially appears It would also be valuable to extend the set of distributions for which we have the techniques to prove constant upper bounds on the Price of Fairness Additionally future work could explore different definitions of fairness If we consider models where candidates are not interchangeable and persist from one time state to another it might be considered more fair to allocate resources preferentially to those who have been waiting longest for resources Finally the model so far largely assumes a fixed amount of resources In some cases though the amount of resources could be increased or decreased and it could be enlightening to consider how modifying the availability of resources might impact the tradeoff between utilization and fairness By developing a richer understanding of the behavior of different classes of distributions in this model we can further our understanding of the interplay between fairness and utilization when we allocate resources with this type of uncertainty
