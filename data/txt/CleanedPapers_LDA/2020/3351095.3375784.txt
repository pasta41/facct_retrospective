Algorithmic Targeting of Social Policies Fairness Accuracy and Distributed Governance Targeted social policies are the main strategy for poverty alleviation across the developing world These include targeted cash transfers CTs as well as targeted subsidies in health education housing energy childcare and others Due to the scale diversity and widespread relevance of targeted social policies like CTs the algorithmic rules that decide who is eligible to benefit from them and who is not are among the most important algorithms operating in the world today Here we report on a year-long engagement towards improving social targeting systems in a couple of developing countries We demonstrate that a shift towards the use of AI methods in poverty-based targeting can substantially increase accuracy extending the coverage of the poor by nearly a million people in two countries without increasing expenditure However we also show that absent explicit parity constraints both status quo and AI-based systems induce disparities across population subgroups Moreover based on qualitative interviews with local social institutions we find a lack of consensus on normative standards for prioritization and fairness criteria Hence we close by proposing a decision-support platform for distributed governance which enables a diversity of institutions to customize the use of AI-based insights into their targeting decisions CONCEPTS Applied computing Law social and behavioral sciences Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence KEYWORDS AI for social good algorithmic fairness targeted social programs proxy means tests cash transfers WORLDWIDE RELEVANCE OF TARGETED SOCIAL POLICIES AND THEIR UNDERLYING ALGORITHMS Algorithmic decision-making systems ADS have become increasingly ubiquitous eg in criminal justice medical diagnosis and treatment human resource management social work credit and insurance Although there is widespread excitement for the potential societal benefit that this type of technology can bring there is also commensurate concern about how it can deepen social inequalities and systematize discrimination Consequently substantial work has surged in recent years on conducting fairness audits of deployed systems as well as on defining and optimizing for algorithmic fairness Notably however the vast majority is focused on developed-world contexts online domains such as targeted advertising search engines and facial recognition and offline domains such as criminal justice child maltreatment and predictive policing Algorithmic targeting of social policies The present work focuses on targeted social development policies ie policies that promote social development and target only a subset of the population most commonly populations in poverty Since two decades ago algorithmic rules underlie the targeting decisions of a large fraction of social policies in the developing world eg poverty prediction algorithms that precondition eligibility to cash transfer programs Here we argue that the algorithms that directly influence or determine critical decisions regarding who benefits from targeted social policies and who doesnt at a large scale and across the global south are among the algorithms of paramount importance operating in the world today Diversity Targeted social policies constitute a major vehicle for fighting poverty and redistributing wealth across the developing world In most countries targeted programs run by governments and NGOs proliferate touching every corner of social Figure Global presence of national targeted cash transfer programs development from cash transfer programs to scholarship programs subsidized health care systems targeted housing and energy subsidies targeted childcare food security retirement pension programs targeted microloans and others Moreover international aid agencies such as USAID require their funded institutions to guide the selection of beneficiaries based on poverty assessment tools in an effort to increase effectiveness and prevent the misuse of funds Scale and Spread To gauge the scale and global spread of targeted policies consider the case of cash transfer programs CTs CTs provide a financial stipend to families in poverty and are often conditional ie requiring beneficiaries to comply with co-responsibilities such as keeping their children in school and attending regular medical appointments More than countries worldwide have implemented national CTs see a map in Figure playing a central role in the countries poverty alleviation and wealth redistribution strategies Only in Mexico and Brazil for example the national CTs combined reach more than million people roughly of the population The present work is motivated by the scale diversity and widespread relevance of targeted social policies like CTs It reports on comprehensive engagements with two Latin American countries towards the development and adoption of more fair accurate and transparent targeting systems THE ACCURACY EDGE LARGE-SCALE IMPACT OF AI-BASED TARGETING Algorithmic Targeting of Social Policies Most social policies like CTs are targeted at the poor However in the developing world reliable income data is typically not available and costly to procure because the majority of people work in informal economic markets Hence targeting most commonly relies on algorithms that estimate households poverty based on observable and less costly proxy data such as education levels demographics and their assets and services In most countries these algorithms are trained to estimate poverty based on large periodic statistically representative household surveys which collect both the proxy features and the income ground truth In their daily operations institutions cannot collect ground truth income data directly from potential beneficiaries due to the cost of eliciting trustworthy income data at such massive scale as well as candidates strong incentives for under-reporting In practice predictive algorithms are imperfect leading to targeting errors In Latin America and other regions it is estimated that targeting systems incur more than exclusion errors and inclusion errors undercoverage and leakage However the methods used during the past two decades for estimating poverty have relied on econometric approaches that are not optimized for out-of-sample prediction and cannot leverage the many non-linear relationships that are typically found in high-dimensional data Hence we hypothesize that substantial accuracy gains could come from the use of modern computational and statistical methods borrowed from the field of artificial intelligence Related work Closest in spirit to the work presented in this section is the work of Mcbride et al The authors there show that out-of-sample estimation can reduce exclusion errors but increase inclusion errors compared to in-sample linear methods traditionally used in poverty prediction tools However they found no consistent advantage from using random forest classifiers over linear methods Our results in this section partially contradict results in showing that AI-based predictive approaches substantially outperform the status quo method in both exclusion and inclusion errors The partial discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that works on small samples n does not perform feature engineering does not conduct meta-parameter search to control overfitting and does not compute the entire exclusion-inclusion error curves when comparing targeting approaches Empirical Evaluation Household surveys data The present study uses publicly-available data from two countries Costa Rica and Colombia which represent populations of medium M and smaller M size characteristic of Latin American countries In particular we use data from household surveys that are collected annually by the countries national statistical offices the same data on which status quo targeting systems are trained and evaluated These surveys constitute one of the most important information instruments in the countries based on which the main poverty prices labor and other socioeconomic indices are computed The surveys are carefully designed to be statistically representative of the population ie unbiased and collect both ground truth income data as well as relevant household information such as socio-demographics living conditions education assets and services information communication services utilities sanitary etc The ground truth income in these surveys is widely considered the best income data available in the countries as compared to income from census data and other surveys due to the robustness of the sampling methodology extensiveness of the questionnaire applied to each household professionality of the field workers and the lack of incentives to under-report Table presents basic statistics of the datasets for each country Algorithms We aim at assessing potential advantages of modern statistical and computational methods compared to the status quo Poverty ratio Years Total Sample Size Population Size Costa Rica M Colombia M Table Household survey data statistics Status quo methods The status quo predictors used for income-based targeting used over the past two decades and still prevailing today stem mainly from econometric methods more suitable for causal inference than out-of-sample prediction Quantile linear regressions QLR are the most common as its often found empirically that these outperform other methods such as regular linear regressions and various matching estimators In what follows we refer to QLR as the status quo methodology AI-based methods We implement a number of algorithms based on the AI paradigm of machine learning In particular the methodological elements that could increase the predictive performance compared to the status quo are feature engineering regularization and better approximator models Discussing the performance of different AI-based predictors is beyond the scope of this work Here we describe only the best-performing methodology See Section A in the Supplementary Material SM for further methodological details Feature engineering We preprocessed the survey data to generate three types of features First expert features crafted by human experts such as the ratio of people over rooms in the households and the age of the head of the households Second statistical features including means modes and entropies for all individual-level variables of household members such as age gender and education Lastly deep features generated by a recursive neural network that condenses information of the individual-level features into a one-dimensional encoding a technique akin to the AI subfield of multiple instance learning MIL Predictive algorithm The best-performing algorithm was a gradient boosting classifier trained on the three feature sets concatenated We used k-fold cross-validation to determine the models meta-parameters and control overfitting In what follows we refer to the above combination of feature engineering and predictive algorithm as the AI-based method Accuracy metrics The two key metrics used by institutions in the social sector to assess the quality of their targeting are exclusion and inclusion errors The exclusion error measures the of poor households incorrectly classified as non-poor denoted by while the inclusion error measures the of non-poor households incorrectly classified as poor denoted by FP TP FP correspond to true positives false positives true negatives and false negatives In what follows we compare the accuracy performance of alternative targeting systems based on these measures Exclusion-Inclusion Curve Targeting rules are composed of two elements a poverty score and an acceptance threshold above/below which candidates are accepted Exclusion and inclusion errors are dependent on the acceptance threshold applied Hence for comparison of poverty prediction methodologies we compute the entire exclusion-inclusion curve EIC which maps the full space of targeting rules that a predictive methodology enables from the universal program to all sizes of targeted programs and down to the non-existent program similar to ROC curves Thereby EICs map the fundamental trade-off between exclusion and inclusion errors Figures a and b present instances of EICs Lastly all error measures presented in this work are computed out-of-sample and confidence intervals are computed non-parametrically by means of bootstrapped resampling Results Figures a and b compare the accuracy performance of the AI-based methodology versus the status quo For each method the exclusion-inclusion curve is plotted mapping the entire set of targeting rules and the trade-off between exclusion and inclusion errors The upper left corner corresponds to programs with no beneficiaries exclusion and inclusion error The lower right corresponds to universal programs exclusion and maximum inclusion error In between solutions correspond to all targeted programs ranging in sizes from zero to the population size In particular point a on the status quo curve corresponds to the targeting rule with an acceptance threshold ta that accepts a number of beneficiaries equal to the countrys poverty rate It is also the acceptance threshold that balances exclusion and inclusion errors ie Similarly point b on the AI-based curve corresponds to the threshold tb that accepts a number of beneficiaries equal to the countrys poverty rate and which balances the errors tb tb Let st denote the size of the accepted population of a targeting rule with threshold t Because the difference between points a and b provides a rather meaningful assessment as it compares the performance of the two methods when both are constrained by a constant budget equal to the amount of poor in the population Points c and d on the AI-based curve correspond to solutions with either equal exclusion errors tc ta or equal inclusion errors td inc ta in comparison to point a on the status quo curve Finally if we want to compare performances irrespective of any particular threshold level but averaged across all we compare the area under the inclusion-exclusion curve AUEIC Figure a and Table present the performance comparison for Colombia It is shown that the AI-based method dominates the status quo by a wide margin and along the entire exclusion-inclusion error curve This means that for any given budget a social program will incur less exclusion error and less inclusion error if it targets based on the AI method In particular comparing points a and b a social program or policy accepting an amount of candidates equal to the countrys poor would reduce its exclusion errors by This metric is equal to the area under the precision-recall curve also known as average precision Inclusion Error E si on E or a c d b

inclusion errors by Table if it switches to the AI-based method Most importantly this reduction in errors means that people in poverty previously misclassified would now be correctly included in the countrys set of social protection policies Figure b and Table present analogous results for Costa Rica where a social program or policy accepting an amount of candidates equal to the countrys poor population would reduce both its exclusion and inclusion errors by Table if it switches to the AI-based method The reduction in errors would mean that people in poverty previously misclassified would be now correctly included in the countrys set of social protection policies Figure and Section A in the SM report a detailed decomposition of the sources of increased accuracy showing that both feature engineering and model non-linearity contributed to the substantial improvement of the AI-based over the status quo Beyond accuracy relevant additional considerations for model choice include fairness robustness and explainability Section studies subgroup disparities in detail Section D in the SM tests the inter-temporal stability of the AI-based and Section C in the SM provides a model-agnostic layer of explainability applicable to both AI-based and status quo methodologies DISPARITIES IN PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE ACROSS SUBGROUPS Section shows that AI-based targeting systems can be substantially more accurate enabling public institutions and NGOs to increase coverage of their target population while maintaining budget constant or reduce the budget while maintaining coverage constant However these results are aggregates across the population as a whole which could hide systematic biases with respect to minorities or other population subgroups In this section we study and compare the performance of AI-based vs status quo targeting systems computing error rates disaggregated by subgroups defined by relevant household characteristics such as urban/rural geographic region gender of the head of the family and family type Relevance To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that algorithmic rules of this sort are audited for potential exclusion disparities across population subgroups As argued in Section potential disparities could have a systematic impact on the lives of millions of socially disadvantaged households across the globe Contributions In summary we show that AI-based targeting reduces the errors local to every population subgroup studied in both countries rendering the transition to AI methods uncontroversial we find substantial disparities in exclusion errors across population subgroups in both methods and the error disparities across subgroups are substantially narrowed by the shift from the status quo methods to the AI-based Methodology We extend the accuracy analysis in Section to the subgroup level For every subgroup and each method ie status quo and AI-based exclusion errors were computed by setting acceptance thresholds equal to the poverty rate base rate of each subgroup This choice of thresholds is analogous to the analysis in Section and emulates the most prevalent practice where social institutions set acceptance thresholds that admit a number of beneficiaries equal to the poverty Reduction in Area Under the Curve AUEIC Reduction in Exclusion Error constant budget ta tb ta Reduction in Inclusion Error constant budget inc ta tb inc ta Increase in Poor Population Covered constant budget Colombia Costa Rica Table Comparative Accuracy Results and their Impact on Coverage of the Poor rate For example Figure a shows the exclusion error rates of urban/rural subgroups in Colombia under the status quo method We then compare the performance across methodologies by computing the relative improvement of the AI-based method over the status quo For example if the status quo and AI-based systems yield exclusion errors of and respectively for a given subgroup then we report that the AI-based achieves a reduction Beyond assessing the subgroup-level benefits of transitioning to the AI system we also assess disparities among subgroups that exist within each method We define the subgroup disparity metric as the standard deviation of the exclusion errors across subgroups ie e where A is a segmentation attribute such as family size and A are the subgroups that it defines Results Subgroup-specific improvements The right column in Figure shows the subgroup-specific improvements in exclusion errors achieved by the AI-based over the status quo for two selected examples of country-attribute pairs It is observed that the AI-based method reduced errors in all cases with a minimum improvement of for rural households in Colombia figures c and Tables and provide an overview of the relative reduction in group-specific errors for all combinations of the two countries and five segmentation attributes urban/rural gender of the head with children family size and region Overall we find that the AI-based method reduced the errors for each subgroup across the five segmentation attributes and two countries The minimum improvement was for region in Colombia whereas a maximum improvement of was attained for unipersonal households in Costa Rica also shown in Figure All subgroup improvement results were significant at confidence Tables and in SM B show full results in absolute terms for all country-attribute pairs Disparities across subgroups We are interested in knowing a whether there are significant disparities in predictive performance across subgroups and b whether these disparities are more salient for one method or another The left and center columns of Figure show that substantial imbalances do exist in predictive performance across subgroups For example figures show that poor Colombian households in urban areas are more likely to be misclassified by either algorithm Similarly figures show that poor Costa Rican unipersonal households are significantly more likely to be misclassified than households with two members or more by either method However we also observe that the AI-based method has a strong effect not only in reducing errors overall but also on balancing error disparities across subgroups Figure shows the subgroup disparities for the status quo method and the AI-based method It is shown that disparities were reduced in both countries and for most segmentation attributes Notable examples are those of Costa Rica where disparities with respect to the with children and family size attributes were cut in half and disparity with respect to urban/rural was reduced to nearly zero Section Conclusions The above results provide three key results First AI-based targeting systems reduced predictive errors for every subgroup according to the five segmentation attributes studied in both countries Because all subgroups result benefited the AI-based Pareto-dominates the status quo at the subgroup level This result is rather positive as it renders uncontroversial among subgroups a decision to transition from the status quo to the AI-based targeting system Second substantial disparities were found across population subgroups for both methods These disparities were dependent on the particularities of each country and sensitive attributes hence supporting the case for requiring empirical evaluations and fairness audits to understand subgroup-level performance prior to deploying algorithmic targeting systems Lastly although both methods entailed disparities in prediction errors across population subgroups the AI-based method had a strong effect in balancing errors and narrowing disparities compared to the status quo FAIR TARGETING AND DISTRIBUTED GOVERNANCE VIA INTERACTIVE DECISION SUPPORT Sections and demonstrate that the AI-based targeting system provides superior accuracy both at the global and subgroups levels and that it reduces disparities among population subgroups when compared to status quo methods Unfortunately these results do not entail that the AI targeting system is fair in absolute terms On the contrary Figure shows that substantial performance disparities exist

these systems However given the centralized-decentralized architecture of real-world social targeting systems Subsection and existing heterogeneous preferences over fairness and prioritization criteria Subsection a major challenge arises how to foster fairness of a multiplicity of targeting rules all using a common algorithmic input but each working under heterogeneous preferences about what fair targeting should be Note of course that the status quo has been deployed in multiple countries for more than two decades Subsection describes a proposed decision-support platform for fostering fair targeting and distributed governance currently being piloted with several social institutions in both countries The Centralized/Decentralized Architecture of Real-World Social Targeting In many countries like Costa Rica Colombia Panama Mexico and Dominican Republic a unified poverty index is constructed by the central government establishing a common methodology for assessing the poverty status of households in the country Urban Gender of Head Children Family Size Subgroup urban rural male female with without Reduct Region Subgroup Reduct Table The AI-based method reduced

gender_head with_children family_size region segmentation attribute di ar A status quo AI-based b Costa Rica Figure Subgroup disparities for the status quo versus AI-based methods according to five segmentation attributes The AI-based method substantially reduces disparities across most segmentation attributes in both countries Similarly agencies like USAID establish a per-country poverty assessment tool These central indices are then consumed in a distributed manner by a wide diversity of social programs and NGOs serving as core and unified criterion for prioritizing and selecting beneficiaries in the country The use of the central methodology is most often mandated by law in an effort to focus public funds on the population segments most in need as well as avoiding manipulation of public funds for political or private interests However the centralization of prioritization and selection criteria creates strong tensions across the diversity of institutions mandated to consume the central poverty index These institutions include everything from cash transfer programs to subsidized healthcare systems subsidized energy housing and child care services scholarship programs pensions to non-formal workers support to micro-entrepreneurs and others They also include a range of geographic scopes encompassing the national regional and local levels of government Hence targeting decisions are the compound product of a central agency issuing the guiding criterion for prioritization and a diversity of social programs consuming that index applying acceptance thresholds based on it and most often complementing it with additional criteria like multidimensional poverty and positive/negative preferences across population subgroups Heterogeneous Preferences Over Fairness and Prioritization Criteria The hybrid centralized/decentralized architecture creates tensions over normative preferences regarding what fairness and prioritization criteria should guide targeting rules Tensions Over Fairness Criteria There are at least three parity-based fairness criteria discussed in the algorithmic fairness literature applicable to the context of selecting beneficiaries of social programs Demographic parity which requires the amount of positively classified individuals of any given group to be proportional to the size that group in the population For example a gender composition in a presidents cabinet Threshold parity which defines fair classification as applying the same acceptance threshold to all individuals in the population Error rate parity which defines fair classification as equal classification error rates across relevant population subgroups Here in particular we consider the special case of equal opportunity which requires only parity in exclusion error or equivalently parity in coverage of the positive class because the context of targeting social benefits is a canonical example of positive interventions It is well known that these parity criteria are most often incompatible and trade-off with one another Moreover there is no consensus in the academic literature about the appropriateness of one over the rest Regarding real-world practice we find from official documentation and qualitative interviews that a complex mix of parity criterion is involved in allocating resources and selecting beneficiaries For example while several official documentation stresses the prevalence of threshold parity criteria interviewees mentioned that geographic and other subgroup quotas also often play a role in budget allocation negotiations Positive discrimination Even more fundamental there is no consensus about parity per se regardless of its definition being the a priori desirable fairness property for social targeting systems On the contrary positive discrimination prevails Institutions targeting social programs commonly prioritize population subgroups that are considered socially disadvantaged guided by a paradigm of positive discrimination and affirmative action rather than parity Examples of these include victims of violence and forced migration in Colombia and households with members with disabilities in Costa Rica Hence it is not clear that one should for example attempt to recalibrate a centrally-defined poverty score to balance exclusion errors selecting relevant subgroups and fairness criteria a priori unless there is certainty that such balance conforms to the policy goals and ethical frameworks of all institutions that will build targeting rules based on it Tensions Over Prioritized Population Subgroups In addition to tensions over fairness criteria the diverse social institutions within countries often demand tailored and more complex prioritization criteria beyond monolithic income poverty scores Many struggle to accommodate additional criteria that respond to their policy goals and to the particular characteristics of their social programs and target population For example while cash transfer programs focus mainly on household poverty programs intended to broaden access to student loans also use standardized educational test scores as complimentary prioritization criteria Similarly subsidized healthcare systems need to incorporate the quality of alternative healthcare services accessible to potential beneficiaries as stated in official program operating rules From a set of interviews conducted as part of this project with managers and field workers of local social institutions we found several additional criteria used in regional-level programs For example in programs providing pensions to poor elderly citizens prioritization criteria often include the amount of time months that applicants have waited in the admissions queue their age as well as the severity of any medical condition they may suffer In a similar vein social programs often attempt to incorporate contextualized preferences over discrete population subgroups which vary substantially according to programs policy goals resources and target population For example interviewees from local institutions mentioned the creation of socioeconomic profiles such as single mother households elderly households with any disability underage orphans or orphans under still in university These socioeconomic profiles are then used in periodic program-specific resource allocation meetings where group-specific acceptance thresholds are discussed and set for each profile until exhausting the periods budget Likewise other commonly prioritized subgroups include indigenous populations population with disabilities and victims of violence and forced migration Interactive Decision Support Platform for Fair Targeting and Distributed Governance It is in this context of centralized/decentralized decision making and heterogeneous preferences that we must reflect on what fair targeting is and how we can design systems that support it Towards it we developed an interactive decision support tool with the following design goals addressing the opportunities described in sections and challenges described in sections Accuracy Empower social institutions to leverage highly accurate AI-based predictors on which to build their targeting rules without requiring expertise in machine learning Distributed Governance Enable decentralization of three design choices fundamental to the design of fair targeting rules a the choice of relevant population subgroups b the choice of fairness criteria type of parity criteria or conversely positive discrimination and c the choice of prioritization criteria eg income or multidimensional poverty Awareness Educate stakeholders in understanding their available space of targeting rules and underlying tradeoffs Inclusiveness and transparency Enable wider discussions among stakeholders over the space of options Increase the transparency and auditability of deployed targeting rules and their rationales Consider the working example of a nation-wide cash transfer program in a Latin American country With the start of the fiscal year the institutions prioritization committee has to select which of the applicants will take one of the available spots this year The committee session starts and the decision support tool is projected on screen First the platform asks to specify the Prioritization criteria the core prioritization criteria to use eg the centrally-defined income poverty score Segmentation attributes the categorical attributes by which they might choose to segment the population eg urban/rural Budget the budget for the period ie available spots Hard filters any hard exclusion criteria to apply according to the target population of the program eg age requirement for a pension program After defining the above key elements the user moves to the main interactive tool for designing targeting rules The interface a Initial state total population without segmentation b Segmentation by urban/rural c one-dimensional prioritization criteria d two-dimensional prioritization criteria e Segmentation by family type Segmentation by vulnerability g Coverage parity Positive discrimination Figure Interactive decision-support platform is composed of three elements the population tree which displays for each population segment the acceptance thresholds set and the percentage of coverage that the thresholds entail figures a and b the thresholds adjustment window figures c and d and the costs stacked bar which displays the segmented costs versus the institutions budget all figures The key functions supported by the platform are a Thresholds adjustment Users can observe the distribution of the population or any segment in terms of the prioritization variable and how the threshold divides the distribution in accepted/nonaccepted Figure c Next they can adjust the threshold interactively observing the impact that threshold shifts have on the of coverage which corresponds to exclusion error pie chart and the associated costs stacked bar on the right b Population Segmentation Users can segment the population in subgroups by clicking the split node button on any leaf node and selecting a segmentation attribute eg family type see figures b e and The platform initially assigns an equal threshold to all subgroups in a split Users can then adjust subgroup-specific thresholds as in a and appreciate interactively the percentage coverage and costs of all groups Hence it forces users to reflect on fundamental trade-offs between coverage and cost and among population subgroups yet providing flexibility for defining relevant segments and priorities among them For example in a country the law may require to give preference to groups such as indigenous households households with disabilities displaced by armed conflict and victims of domestic violence In that case the user may explore shifting thresholds to reach coverage of each vulnerable group but will then be forced to acknowledge the reductions in coverage of non-vulnerable groups needed to keep the program in budget Figure c Balance for parity Users can easily implement different parity criteria across subgroups by clicking balance button on any parent node and selecting one of three parity criteria to implement coverage parity which implies exclusion error parity thresholds parity or demographic parity The platform automatically finds the combination of thresholds that achieves the specified parity while maintaining constant the cost incurred by the parent node Figures g and exemplify the cases of threshold parity coverage parity and positive discrimination a Dual prioritization criteria Institutions often require to complement income poverty scores with additional indices Use cases include scholarship programs considering both economic need and academic performance pension programs considering income poverty and the amount of months applicants have waited in the admissions queue loan programs considering income poverty and repayment risk and the relevant use case of multidimensional poverty indices For dual criteria the platform maps the joint distribution of the population or segment and enables the user to explore combinations of the two thresholds Figure d Thereby institutions can reflect on emphasizing either criteria in accordance with their policy goals and with proper awareness of the coverage and cost implications CONCLUSIONS The present work presents a comprehensive study focused on a relevant domain the targeting of social policies We demonstrate that a shift towards the use of AI methods in poverty-based targeting can substantially increase accuracy both globally and with respect to each population subgroup studied This improvement enables an increase in coverage of the poor of nearly a million people in the two countries studied without increasing their social budgets However it is also shown that both the status quo and AI-based systems suffer from significant performance disparities across population subgroups Hence we close by proposing an interactive decision support platform that empowers social institutions to design fair and accurate targeting rules tailored to their needs under a distributed governance framework and enhanced transparency Despite the advantages here shown potential adopters of AI-based approaches to social targeting should be mindful of at least two potential disadvantages First the shift from linear to nonlinear models loses the interpretability of linear coefficients Yet this disadvantage is mitigated by the construction of a model-agnostic layer of explainability such as the feature sensitivity maps presented in Section C of the SM These make AI algorithms more transparent and allow for accountability during the decision-making process Second deployed systems should be tested for inter-temporal robustness and monitored for relevant changes in the statistical distributions underlying the prediction task In the case of the two countries here studied distributions were stable and one-year inter-temporal accuracy was virtually equal to same-year cross-validated accuracy see SM D We are currently conducting pilots with multiple social institutions in Costa Rica Colombia and Panama on the use of the decision-support platform described in Section Future work may report on the multi-stakeholder preferences over prioritization and fairness criteria elicited during pilots as well as on the dynamics towards or away from consensus Finally the improvement of poverty-estimation models and the eligibility rules derived from them are only two of several high-value opportunities in the use of AI approaches for improving the targeting of social policies Exciting applications currently in development include a The use of transfer and multi-task learning for leveraging multi-country data towards improved models particularly in small countries with small data samples b The integration of remote sensing and household survey data into comprehensive targeting systems that inform both the deployment of field workers on the ground prospection and the prioritization of applicants selection under a proactive targeting paradigm that optimizes information cost accuracy and fairness And c the use of AI approaches to reduce survey measurement errors by assisting field workers on the ground in targeting their information verification efforts We hope the work here presented sparks attention towards these high-value opportunities in the use of AI for social good and ultimately contributes to lead governments multinational organizations and NGOs towards more effective and equitable targeting of social policies across the global south
