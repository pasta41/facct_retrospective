Onward for the freedom of others Marching beyond the AI Ethics The debate on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence brought together different stakeholders including but not limited to academics policymakers CEOs activists workers representatives lobbyists journalists and moral machines Prominent political institutions crafted principles for the ethical being of the AI companies while tech giants were documenting ethics in a series of self-written guidelines In parallel a large community started to flourish focusing on how to technically embed ethical parameters into algorithmic systems Founded upon the philosophical work of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre this paper explores the philosophical antinomies of the AI Ethics debate as well as the conceptual disorientation of the fairness discussion By bringing the philosophy of existentialism to the dialogue this paper attempts to challenge the dialectical monopoly of utilitarianism and sheds fresh light on the -already glaring- AI arena Why is the AI Ethics guidelines a futile battle doomed to dangerous abstraction How this battle can harm our sense of collective freedom Which is the uncomfortable reality that remains obscured by the smoke gas of the AI Ethics discussion And eventually whats the alternative There seems to be a different pathway for discussing and implementing ethics A pathway that sets the freedom of others at the epicenter of the battle for a sustainable and open to all future CONCEPTS Computing methodologies Philosophical/theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence Social and professional topics Codes of ethics KEYWORDS Ethics artificial intelligence algorithms existentialism philosophy Introduction The Ethics of AI has conquered industry news and academic literature at least for the last years Promising endeavors by public institutions were cemented in pages of Guiding Principles for Ethical Artificial Intelligence and at the same time companies tried to take the lead in promoting ethical practices by crafting strategies or by setting up ethical boards Within the same realm a distinct community emerged focusing on how to pragmatically and technically embed our ethical commitments and values into the systems we build Scholars and journalists have criticized the bigoted emphasis of industry leaders academia and policymakers on the production of AI Ethics guidelines and policies In the AI Now Institutes Report it was stated that ethical codes meant to steer the AI field should be accompanied by strong oversight and accountability mechanisms while Julia Powles and Helen Nissenbaum in a widely cited blog post warn that too much attention and resources in fixing AI eventually leaves no room for discussing whether AI should be used at the first place Hence the prioritization of external and non-self-regulatory mechanisms along with the necessity of a broader vision on the social utility of AI are the principal arguments on the insufficiency ethics and the dearth of the fairness discussion This paper echoes some of these critics and attempts to provide a new perspective into the analysis of the current state of affairs in the field of AI and Ethics Firstly it aims to challenge the dialogical monopoly of the ethical guidelines and suggests a different approach for the fairness discussion by confronting the conceptual grounds and the philosophical foundations on which these two research areas have been built Secondly this paper contributes to the ethics debate by recommending a different philosophical perspective to ground and promote the discussion on and application of ethics in the real world This new perspective is rooted in the ideas of existentialism as expressed in the work of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre
