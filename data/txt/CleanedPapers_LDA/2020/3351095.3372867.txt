Implications of AI Un-Fairness in Higher Education Admissions The Effects of Perceived AI Un-Fairness on Exit Voice and Organizational Reputation Algorithmic decision-making ADM is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life In higher education machine learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM That is algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but rather reproduce biases existing within the respective training data This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness Specifically we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness i procedural fairness and ii distributive fairness Using cross-sectional survey data n from a large German university we tested whether students assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs human decision-making HDM within the higher education context Furthermore we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables which are hugely important for universities exit voice and organizational reputation The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions we find that distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system whereas only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting Finally distributive fairness but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation For universities aiming to implement ADM systems it is crucial therefore to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account CONCEPTS Human-centered computing Empirical studies in HCI Applied Computing Sociology Applied Computing Education KEYWORDS Distributive Fairness Procedural Fairness Artificial Intelligence Algorithmic Decision Making Higher Education Systems Reputation Voice Exit ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS Algorithmic decision-making ADM is being applied increasingly in virtually all sectors of social life such as medicine public administration and finance In addition institutions of higher education such as universities have begun implementing artificial intelligence AI applications to predict student performance analyze academic teaching communicate with students through the use of bots perform dropout detection and structure their financial organization for an overview of the use of AI applications in German universities see Even the possibility of university admission was recently part of the public discourse Its easy to imagine for example how a college-admissions committee might turn the laborious and uncertain sifting of applicants over to a machine-learning model such a model might purport to optimize an entering cohort not just for academic success but also for harmonious relationships and generous alumni donations Such a system could be quite valuable as universities spend considerable financial and human resources on the admission process In Germany many study programs at public universities are freely accessible and free of charge However it is not always possible to enroll directly in a program at ones university of choice If there are fewer courses of study available than are requested by interested parties admission is restricted At the time of this study about of the programs nationwide were admission-restricted with the rest being admission-free Courses in medicine pharmacy veterinary medicine dentistry and communication science are so popular that they are restricted at all universities nationwide In addition a large number of degree programs at individual universities have restricted admission At the university where we conducted this empirical study these also include programs for example in political science economics and sociology In principle restrictions apply to study programs that grant access to professions with a particularly high income or that open up access to popular occupational fields eg media business The principle of best selection generally guides the selection process at higher education institutions that is the primary concern is about selecting those applicants who possess as many of the necessary skills and abilities as possible In a broader sense the aim is to keep the dropout rate as low as possible because high dropout rates not only damage the reputation of study courses and degree programs but also harm institutes financially as their public funding is dependent among other things on the number of graduates they produce Applicants with the best average grades on their school reports fill most of the study spaces In addition universities can define further selection criteria for local admission procedures such as selection interviews internships weighting of certain grades in the diploma or a completed study ability test These criteria differ from university to university and from subject to subject Since selection interviews evaluations of motivation letters or aptitude tests are very resource-intensive it appears logical to consider the use of automated procedures with AI in the admission process The use of ADM has the potential to make this process more cost-effective and faster which could benefit both the university and the applicants Yet a controversial discourse also exists regarding the fairness of student admission systems in general On the one hand it includes the question of which data or information to account for and whether this information is valid On the other hand it addresses individual fairness perceptions of decision-making practices and decision outcomes Thus we conceptually distinguish two faces of fairness While factual fairness refers to objectively measurable features perceived fairness is a construct that relates to individual perceptions Factual and perceived fairness are presumably correlated but conceptually distinct Despite the scant empirical research within the social sciences fairness must be treated as a pivotal value with respect to ADM In a survey Araujo et al found that fairness was the second most important value for ADM among Dutch citizens Given the importance of fairness it also seems to be of interest to evaluate the outcomes of perceived fairness or unfairness of ADM Considering that AI-driven systems take over tasks that humans previously executed it is crucial to investigate differences between ADM and HDM with regard to perceived fairness Thus this study addressed two research questions First we investigated whether ADM is perceived as fairer or more unfair than HDM in terms of procedural and distributive fairness Second we tested the effects of AI fairness perceptions on attitudes and behaviors relevant to the university organization namely exit voice and organizational reputation In particular we examined the effects of perceived procedural and distributional AI fairness on the intentions to protest ADM and refrain from applying to a university that uses ADM in the application process Furthermore we examined the link between AI fairness and the overall reputation of a university that uses such a system THE CONCEPT OF AI FAIRNESS In the current literature on ADM the term unfairness usually denotes ADM systems that systematically discriminate against individuals or groups while favoring others This would be the case for example if ADM systems were to reject university applicants because they have a Muslim sounding name Since discrimination becomes evident in the result of an automated classification this is referred to as a violation of distributive fairness To be able to classify a certain ADM outcome as unfair we require the violation of a valid norm by the distribution result For instance the constitutions of all democratic states prohibit discrimination against people based on their race gender religious beliefs etc An ADM system that does just that is obviously unconstitutional and factually unfair The task of computer science then is to adapt the algorithm such that it can avoid this norm violation without impairing the performance of the ADM Insofar as this is demonstrably successful proof of fairness is achieved Similarly it would be possible to confirm an objective breach of procedural fairness if the ADM were to access legally protected data that the service provider was not allowed to use In both cases unfairness would be measured against objective criteria that violate a given standard Studies on such phenomena point to the need for political and legal regulation of the use of ADM in a given area of application Our interest was not in taking the perspective of decision-makers lawyers or politicians rather we were interested in the point of view of those affected by the use of ADM within an institution In other words we concentrate on perceived fairness rather than factual fairness We based this research on the assumption that factual and perceived fairness of algorithmic systems are equally important It is not enough for technical systems to have been tested and determined to be fair and working efficiently if people nevertheless encounter them with fear and mistrust and subsequently become demotivated and dissatisfied and lose their attachment to the respective institution It is also not enough for people to be satisfied with technical systems even though they violate objective requirements for fair decision-making legal norms or ethical rules While technical definitions and formal proof of fairness are widely acknowledged within the machine learning community it is time to focus on individual perceptions Individual reactions include emotional eg fear cognitive eg trust and behavioral eg protest responses of different kinds We assume that the perceived fairness of ADM strongly influences human responses to ADM Perceived fairness is not only about objective norm violation but also about perceived violations of the individual sense of justice by ADM systems This user-centered approach views the subjective perceptions of the treatment that an individual receives from other individuals or institutions as the core of the concept Therefore perceived fairness is an individual cognitive reaction directed towards manifest actions of third parties Shin and Park conclude that There might not be an objective standard of transparency fairness and accountability The subject of FAT fairness accountability and transparency lies in the eye of the beholder Of course the perceived fairness of an ADM is not independent of factual fairness but it is also not identical to it If an algorithm classifies without discrimination in the aggregate it can still be perceived as unfair at the individual level Since the individual user normally does not know which distribution result an ADM produces in the concerned population eg who gets a loan from the bank and who does not who is classified as a potential dropout and who is expected to graduate there is no other option but to base the assessment on ones own results In the worst case those affected will always assume that they have received an unfair share of the burden to be distributed and the benefits to be gained when the automated classification result has fallen short of their expectations Subjective perceptions also play a role concerning procedural fairness which is usually determined by computer scientists on the basis of the quality of data used For example someone affected by an automated recruitment process will perceive the result as fair if he/she has reason to believe that the information used in the decision-making process was correct reliable valid and complete However a rational judgment is hardly possible which is why the perceived procedural fairness will be based on more or less well-founded assessments prejudices and assumptions A concept of perceived fairness understood in this way obviously cannot be determined definitively rather the perceived fairness of ADM technologies is always specific The respective assessment dimensions used and individual assessments of these categories can vary considerably from person to person depending on the area of application and use case Social science research is aimed at determining on which factors individual perceptions of fairness depend and what consequences this might have On the side of independent variables personality factors as well as characteristics of the technology itself but also characteristics of the situation and use case are taken into consideration Typical dependent variables are acceptance of ADM decisions trust in their correctness but also behavioral responses such as voice or exit DISTRIBUTIVE AND PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS Concepts The organizational justice literature suggests using a multidimensional construct of fairness In this paper we focus on two of those dimensions procedural and distributive fairness In that sense it is possible to judge fairness by the process that is in terms of machine learning the input and throughput phases and the result of an AI-driven process output Arguably fairness judgments can differ between those dimensions Distributive fairness refers to the fair distribution of resources Verma and Rubin provided an overview of the mathematical formulae ensuring a fair outcome In the case of ADM algorithmic distributive unfairness may be the outcome of biased training data that unwillingly reproduce real-world discrimination In Germany for example children of workers could be denied access to higher education simply because they are currently underrepresented at universities compared to middle-class children Discrimination may then lead to perceptions of distributive unfairness However it is possible to achieve distributive fairness if one perceives that the outcome of an AI process is just and fair Distributive fairness perceptions are dependent on the respective individually accepted distribution norms at hand which can vary considerably between different contexts For instance while we might expect basic human rights to be distributed according to the principle of equality salaries or social benefits are typically distributed on the basis of equity or need Some studies have looked into the determinants of distributive fairness perceptions and have found that process-related variables impact how people evaluate the outcome of ADM Procedural fairness relates to the process or in technical terms the data and mechanism used to achieve the outcome According to the literature on HDM procedural fairness can be evaluated by considering six factors consistency neutrality precision revocability ethics and representativeness If we assume that machines are judged against the same standards ADM will be perceived as fair if people get the impression that the system meets these same criteria In AI research questions of procedural justice are dealt with far less frequently than problems of distributive justice However Grgić-Hlača et al conducted a study on feature selection of ADM tools They developed a survey asking participants to rate the possible features of an algorithm in three categories if it is fair to use a feature if it is fair to use a piece of information if it increases the accuracy of the outcome and if it is fair to use a piece of information if one group of people is more likely to be falsely predicted The results of the study suggested a huge variety in fairness judgments of features Features that have a clear thematic linkage to the aim of the algorithm tend to be rated as fair On the contrary demographic features like age gender or race tend to be regarded as the most unfair features even if those features may enhance the precision of an algorithm Thus judgments of the fairness of an algorithm appear to depend on the imagination and selection of the feature Furthermore according to Grgić-Hlača et al features are not only rated as fair on the basis of discriminatory impact Fairness judgments are built on criteria like the reliability and relevance of the feature or if it causes a specific outcome ADM vs HDM Oftentimes AI applications take over tasks that humans previously executed Thus there is a growing body of literature comparing the perceptions of human and algorithmic decision-makers In a series of experiments Logg Minson and Moore identified that laypersons in particular show an algorithmic appreciation in other words they ascribe many positive characteristics to algorithms and trust ADM more than HDM Moreover among other variables such as risk trust and emotions fairness is also addressed as a relevant construct with respect to comparing ADM and HDM The research suggests that differences in fairness perceptions depend on the respective task that is carried out One study found no difference between evaluations of the fairness of humans and machines in tasks requiring mechanical skills However the authors did find that tasks requiring human skills were in fact rated as fairer when humans executed them By contrast another research team found that in high impact situations in the context of justice and health decisions AI was perceived as fairer than humans experts As we may regard admission to a study program as a high impact situation for a student and the application process as a merely technical task we propose following hypotheses Ha ADM applications are attributed higher distributive fairness than HDM committees are Hb ADM applications are attributed higher procedural fairness than HDM committees are IMPLICATIONS OF PERCEIVED UNFAIRNESS IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXT As stated earlier we propose that fairness perceptions trigger specific reactions In our study we focused on two behavioral intention variables exit and voice as well as one cognitive variable reputation As public institutions universities in Germany receive public funds according to the number of enrolled students Consequently they compete with each other over student applications In this regard a positive reputation among current and future students becomes a pivotal resource for public universities Should the impression arise at the very beginning of a student career namely during the application process that the university treats applicants unfairly presumably this will not only influence the students behavior but might also damage the universitys reputation overall For instance the recent college admissions bribery scandal in the United States makes it plausible to assume that a defective and unfair admission process may have substantial detrimental effects on the universitys reputation To measure students reactions to a university deploying ADM systems we used Hirschmans seminal distinction between exit and voice While neoclassical theory assumes that customers who are dissatisfied with a providers services simply switch to a competitor that is exit Hirschman stressed that under the conditions of limited competition in monopolized markets other modes of response are more likely and probably also more effective Clients articulate their protest with the aim of changing grievances In addition to those behavioral variables we assessed students cognitive responses with respect to the perceived reputation of a university using ADM This leads to the following hypotheses Perceived distributive and procedural AI fairness negatively affect the intention to move to another university exit Perceived distributive and procedural AI fairness negatively affect the intention to voice ones protest Perceived distributive and procedural AI fairness positively affect the universitys reputation METHOD Procedure To test our hypotheses we conducted a laboratory survey among students of a large university in Germany between June and To recruit participants we attached posters to notice boards in several public university buildings as well as personal recruitment on the university campus Personal recruitment took place at all highly trafficked spots on campus such as the cafeteria and the library to obtain a reliable sample of the student population of the university Therefore it is worth noting that our study was susceptible to the limitation of self-selected samples Although we were prudent about endeavoring to reach out to all students it is plausible to assume that some students were a priori excluded from the sample eg students who were not on campus when the study was conducted The study was advertised under the neutral title University of the future to minimize selection bias Students were asked to sign up for a date online or to drop by the laboratory spontaneously Participants first had to sign a privacy statement before completing the questionnaire The average time to complete the questionnaire was approximately minutes M SD To begin with participants answered some questions regarding their attitudes toward and knowledge of digitalization Next they read a short explanation of how human committees currently decide university admissions to programs with limited spaces The questionnaire pointed out that AI technology could take over the task by analyzing all available applicants data and based on the results recommend approvals or declines of the applicants Participants then had to rate the fairness of the HDM and ADM Following this they were asked to answer some questions about the reputation of a university that might use such an automated system as well as their likelihood of applying to another university that does not use ADM or protesting the use of such systems at their university of choice Finally participants provided demographic information as well as some student information like the study program in which they are enrolled or number of semesters that they have already completed Finally participants were thanked and incentivized with Sample In total participants completed the survey However one case was excluded from the dataset because the participant answered the questionnaire in an unrealistic amount of time t minutes This minimum time-mark was assessed prior to data collection in a pre-test with independent raters Thus our final sample consisted of participants Considering gender distribution of the participants were women and were men whereas three participants did not indicate their gender The vast majority of participants were born in Germany On average they were years old M SD and had studied for four or five semesters thus far M SD Most participants were enrolled in an undergraduate program followed by a graduate program and a PhD program Furthermore participants were enrolled in the faculty of philosophy in the faculty of mathematics and natural sciences in the faculty of economics in the faculty of medical and health sciences and in the faculty of law The sample depicts the student body of the university quite well in terms of gender distribution women university vs sample men university vs sample However we oversampled students of humanities and social sciences and undersampled students of natural sciences This might be because the study was conducted in a building belonging to the faculty of philosophy it is reasonable to assume that many participants who spontaneously took part in the survey were students of the corresponding faculty Furthermore we compared our descriptive data with the official student body statistics in Germany provided by the Federal Statistical Office In terms of gender distribution women are overrepresented in our sample by Additionally we oversampled students from the philosophy/law/economics departments by approximately from the mathematics/natural sciences departments by and from the medicine department by The oversampling of all disciplines occurred because the university where we conducted the study has no engineering department As of German students are enrolled in an engineering degree program our sample inevitably overrepresents all disciplines compared to the official student statistics Measurement Fairness Perceptions We measured fairness perceptions for both the HDM committee and the ADM application in terms of distributive fairness and procedural fairness The former dimension assessed fairness regarding the potential outcome of the admission process The latter dimension measured the perceived fairness of the process itself We gauged both dimensions via a single item on a five-point Likert scale do not agree at all to totally agree For distributive fairness perception participants rated the statement The selection of applicants is fair MHDM for procedural fairness they rated the statement The procedure is unbiased MHDM Exit To measure the intention to withdraw from a university that uses an AI-based admission system we decided to insinuate a negatively associated scenario Thus we told participants to imagine that an ADM system declined their application We adopted this approach from Binns et al Respondents then rated the following four items on a five-point Likert scale do not agree at all to totally agree Im avoiding the university that turned me down I prefer other universities that do not use an ADM admission system I want nothing more to do with the university that rejected me and I would not apply to a university that uses an ADM admission system Subsequently we computed a mean index for exit behavior Cronbachs M SD Voice We gauged raising ones voice against a university that uses an ADM admission system under the same conditions as exit behavior Likewise we measured this via four items on a five-point Likert scale do not agree at all to totally agree The item wordings were as follows I would actively oppose the admission system I would participate in a demonstration against the admission system I would sign a petition against the admission system and I would support a protest against the admission system We calculated a mean index for protest behavior Cronbachs M SD Reputation of the university We employed the RepTrakTM Pulse to assess the reputation of a university using an AI-based admission system It consists of the four items It is a university I have a good feeling about It is a university that I trust It is a university that I admire and The university has a good overall reputation Participants rated these statements on a five-point Likert scale do not agree at all to totally agree We used these four items to compute a reliable mean index Cronbachs M SD RESULTS To answer Ha we performed a dependent t-test comparing perceptions of distributive fairness between ADM and HDM Our results show that participants perceived the ADM system M SE as significantly fairer than the HDM system M SE t p r That is regarding the output of the admission process they considered ADM to be less biased in one direction or the other compared to human committee members making the decision Thus our data support Ha As for Hb we carried out a dependent t-test to determine differences between ADM and HDM with respect to procedural justice On average participants viewed the AI-driven process as fairer M SE than the HDM process M SE t p r This result supports Hb Addressing hypotheses we ran three multiple ordinary least squares OLS regression models We entered the predictors in a two-step process First we tested the effects of the demo graphic and study-specific variables and the distributive and procedural fairness perceptions of HDM In the second step we entered the perceptions of distributive and procedural fairness concerning ADM Thus we account for the proportion of explained variance in the models Tables depict the results The first regression model explains of the variance in the dependent variable exit meaning that the explanatory power of the model is rather low Table depicts the predictors influence on the dependent variable We see in block that faculty membership exhibits a significant negative effect The perception of procedural fairness of HDM also exerts a significant negative effect Table OLS regression with exit Exit b SE Step Intercept Gender male Age Faculty Graduation status Semester count HDM DF HDM PF Step Intercept Gender male Age Faculty Graduation status Semester HDM DF HDM PF ADM DF ADM PF Note adj R p p p Turning to the final model we find that both effects are equally strong faculty PF Thus studying a mathematics or natural science subject lowers the intention to migrate to a different university Furthermore perceiving HDM as biased/unfair strengthens the intention to exit Contrary to our assumptions perceiving the admission process by HDM as unfair is not necessarily seen as a threat but more as an opportunity One plausible explanation may be that some students who rate the process as unfair might turn to such universities because they expect their chances of admission to be greater Turning to fairness perceptions with respect to ADM the results suggest that ADM procedural fairness also has a negative effect on withdrawal Thus when one perceives the ADM admission process as unfair one might turn to other universities that do not use an AI-driven system For that we recoded the faculty Mathematics Natural Sciences and graduate degree variables Undergraduate into dummy variables Note that the human fairness perceptions are abbreviated as HDM DF for HDM Distributive Fairness and HDM PF for HDM Procedural Fairness similarly ADM Interestingly distributive ADM fairness perceptions show no significant effect on intention to exit Thus it is not the experience of an unfair result that deters applicants Instead the mere fact that an ADM system makes the decision is sufficient to persuade potential applicants to move to another university Therefore our data partially support owing to the significant effect of the procedural ADM fairness dimension but not the distributive ADM fairness dimension Overall the second model explains of the variance of the dependent variable whereas the lions share is explained by the ADM-specific fairness variables Table depicts the regression coefficients for the predictors of the dependent variable voice Age and faculty membership both have a significant effect on voice Thus older students are somewhat more sympathetic to protesting in the case of an ADM system declining their university application We further find that studying in the mathematics or natural sciences department decreases the intention to protest the ADM system Table OLS regression with voice Voice B SE Step Intercept Gender male Age Faculty Graduation status Semester count HDM DF HDM PF Step Intercept Gender male Age Faculty Graduation status Semester HDM DF HDM PF ADM DF ADM PF Note adj R p p Including the ADM-specific variables in the models shows that faculty membership still has a significant effect on voice whereas the effect of age disappears However more importantly the perceptions of both ADM fairness dimensions have a significant negative impact on voice with the perception of distributive fairness having a stronger effect than the perception of fairness perceptions are abbreviated as ADM DF for ADM Distributive Fairness and ADM PF for ADM Procedural Fairness procedural fairness This means that perceiving the predicted outcome of ADM as unfair fuels the motivation to protest such a decision-making system Perceiving the process itself as unfair and biased also adds to the intention to raise ones voice against ADM Based on these results we accept Both procedural and distributive ADM fairness perceptions have a significant negative effect on voice The third regression model explains of the variance in the dependent variable organizational reputation The largest share of variance is explained by the two ADM fairness perceptions Again faculty membership has a significant effect it shows a positive impact on organizational reputation However the effect is not robust when adding the ADM-specific variables as it is only significant at the p level Nevertheless students of mathematics or natural sciences tend to assign a better reputation to universities that adopt an AI-driven admission system In addition distributive ADM fairness perceptions strongly predict a higher reputation of a university deploying AI-driven admission systems Thus if one considers admission through ADM as fair the overall reputation of the university increases Interestingly the perception of procedural ADM fairness has no significant effect on reputation For the universitys reputation whether the admission process is biased or unbiased seems irrelevant as long as the output of the decision is considered just The findings therefore offer partial support for Table OLS regression with organizational

HDM PF ADM DF ADM PF Note adj R p p p DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This study shows that the use of ADM systems at universities has ambivalent consequences for the institution concerned The expected consequences depend precisely on whether those who are affected perceive such systems as fair or biased Our results suggest that perceptions of distributive fairness and procedural fairness negatively affect the intention to protest ADM usage for admission to public universities They further show that procedural fairness perceptions have a negative effect on exit intentions and distributive fairness perceptions have a positive impact on organizational reputation Thus our study contributes to the growing literature on fairness perceptions of ADM in several ways First concerning the comparison between ADM and HDM we find that in terms of procedural and distributive fairness people perceive AI-driven systems as fairer This finding is in line with literature arguing that AI is perceived as fairer that humans in high-impact decisions Arguably admission to public universities is an example of a high-impact decision for students Looking more deeply participants rated the procedural dimensions especially as fairer in the ADM scenario It seems like HDM committees are perceived as more biased in their admission procedure Yet students perceive ADM to be more objective and fairer Furthermore the distributive fairness dimension shows considerably large fairness differences The output of the AI-driven admission system is considered to be much fairer than that of a human committee Thus regarding fairness perceptions ADM is perceived as a fairer tool for students than HDM Yet what are the subsequent effects of those perceptions address these questions As predicted all models show that at least one dimension of ADM fairness perception has a significant effect on behavioral intention or the universitys reputation Moreover we see that the question of which fairness dimension is relevant seems to depend on the outcome variable For example in the case of reputation only the distributive AI fairness perception seems to matter whereas in the case of exit only the procedural AI fairness dimensions has an effect As outlined above it is important to distinguish between different dimensions of fairness perceptions Fairness is thus a multidimensional construct as the organizational justice literature suggests in that different dimensions account for different effects on different outcome variables Future studies should pay closer attention to the multidimensionality of fairness perceptions and develop a more comprehensive framework for investigating perceived fairness We find that organizational reputation is only dependent on the assumed distributive AI fairness Thus if a university is concerned about its reputation among students it should focus on the output of its AI-driven admission process If applicants view university admissions by ADM as fair it significantly increases the overall reputation of the university In this case it seems not to matter if and how people judge the process itself Nevertheless here lies a crucial problem As students only receive information about their own classification and not the aggregate results they may likely judge their own result as unfair if they are rejected More research is needed to disentangle the individual and combined causal effects of distributive and procedural fairness on organizational reputation Concerning exit however we see that perceived procedural AI unfairness fuels students intention to act by turning their back on the university and studying elsewhere A possible explanation for this might be that students feel powerless because of the AI process which leads to a decline in university spaces Moreover human procedural fairness perceptions fuel the intention to apply to a university that does not use an AI-based student admission system The results raise a somewhat counterintuitive question about why some students might actually aim for a biased process where they might influence the process and improve their chances of acceptance However these thoughts are somewhat speculative and future research should address them Finally we see that both distributive AI fairness perceptions and procedural AI fairness perceptions contribute to students intention to raise their voice against an AI-driven student admission system by protesting As unrest leaves a bad impression on the public universities should take the satisfaction of their students into account Ultimately protest behavior on the part of students can result in tensions between the university and its students This may have negative effects on student performance as well as on the reputation and operational efficiency of the university However voice is the more informative sign for a learning institution while silent exit is the more dangerous threat Thus universities should provide sufficient opportunities for criticism and feedback when implementing ADM systems to prevent applicants from leaving immediately Notably we also find that one particular student-specific variable matters in all three models namely faculty membership Students of mathematics and natural sciences overall show less of an intention to protest the AI-driven admission system or to follow an exit strategy They also tend to attribute a higher reputation to a university that uses advanced technologies This leads us to conclude that students who arguably have more contact points with and greater knowledge of ADM technologies seem more open to the introduction of an AI-driven admission system For universities that plan to introduce AI-driven systems it is therefore important to address all stakeholders and consider that students from some faculties might react differently than others It is important to note that this study faced several limitations First we conducted this study in one German university Therefore the results are not representative of students of other universities neither in Germany nor in other countries Students of other universities especially those universities that already use ADM might have other attitudes and perceptions of AI technologies Thus future studies should take into account more universities and check if the effects found in this study are robust in different contexts Second we measured fairness perceptions as single items Although many recent studies have used this measurement we believe that a multi-item measurement of AI fairness is needed to account for more factors of the specific fairness dimensions In general our study sheds light on several important points regarding fairness in the higher education context First it is important to differentiate between specific fairness dimensions Fairness dimensions are judged specifically and have different effects on dependent variables Second if students think that they are receiving unfair treatment they will intend to act against a university introducing ADM either in protest against the application or by turning their back on the university in general Since universities receive funds according to the number of enrolled students it is essential that they maintain or even increase their study body thus these perceptions are highly relevant Furthermore distributive fairness perceptions increase a universitys reputation and thus give in addition to the efficiency advantage a potential incentive to implement AI-driven systems Altogether students fairness perceptions are highly relevant when planning to introduce AI-driven systems in organizational processes
