Interventions for Ranking in the Presence of Implicit Bias Implicit bias is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities or lack thereof to a member from a particular social group eg defined by gender or race Studies on implicit bias have shown that these unconscious stereotypes can have adverse outcomes in various social contexts such as job screening teaching or policing Recently considered a mathematical model for implicit bias and showed the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule as a constraint to improve the utility of the outcome for certain cases of the subset selection problem Here we study the problem of designing interventions for the generalization of subset selection ranking that requires to output an ordered set and is a central primitive in various social and computational contexts We present a family of simple and interpretable constraints and show that they can optimally mitigate implicit bias for a generalization of the model studied by Kleinberg and Raghavan Subsequently we prove that under natural distributional assumptions on the utilities of items simple Rooney Rule-like constraints can also surprisingly recover almost all the utility lost due to implicit biases Finally we augment our theoretical results with empirical findings on real-world distributions from the IIT-JEE dataset and the Semantic Scholar Research corpus CONCEPTS Information systems Content ranking Mathematics of computing Probability and statistics KEYWORDS Implicit bias ranking algorithmic fairness interventions Implicit bias is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities or lack thereof to a member from a particular social group defined by characteristics such as gender origin or race It is well understood that implicit bias is a factor in adverse effects against subpopulations in many societal contexts as also highlighted by recent events in the popular press For instance in employment decisions men are perceived as more competent and given a higher starting salary even when qualifications are the same and in managerial jobs it was observed that women had to show roughly twice as much evidence of competence as men to be seen as equally competent In education implicit biases have been shown to exist in ways that exacerbate the achievement gap for racial and ethnic minorities and female students and add to the large racial disparities in school discipline which particularly affect black students school performance and future prospects Beyond negatively impacting social opportunities implicit biases have been shown to put lives at stake as they are a factor in police decisions to shoot negatively impacting people who are black and of other racial or ethnic minorities Furthermore decision making that relies on biased measures of quantities such as utility can not only adversely impact those perceived more negatively but can also lead to sub-optimal outcomes for those harboring these unconscious biases To combat this a significant effort has been placed in developing anti-bias training with the goal of eliminating or reducing implicit biases However such programs have been shown to have limited efficacy Furthermore as algorithms increasingly take over prediction and ranking tasks eg for ranking and shortlisting candidates for interview algorithms can learn from and encode existing biases present in past hiring data eg against gender or race resulting in algorithmic biases of their own Hence it is important to develop interventions that can mitigate implicit biases and hence result in better outcomes As a running example we will consider hiring although the interventions we describe would apply to any domain in which people are selected or ranked Hiring usually works in multiple stages where the candidates are first identified and ranked in order of their perceived relevance a shortlist of these candidates are then interviewed with more rigor and finally a one or few of them are hired The Rooney Rule is an intervention to combat biases during the shortlisting phase it requires the shortlister an entity that shortlists to select at least one candidate from an underprivileged group for interview It was originally introduced for coach positions in the National Football League and subsequently adopted by other industries The idea is that including the underprivileged candidates would give opportunity to these candidates with a higher hidden or latent potential Whereas without the Rooney Rule these candidates may not have been selected for interview While the Rooney Rule appears to have been effective is just one of many possible interventions one could design How can we theoretically compare two proposed interventions study the Rooney Rule under a theoretical model of implicit bias with two disjoint groups Ga Gb m candidates where Gb is the underprivileged group Each candidate i m has a true latent utility wi R which is the utility they would generate if hired and an observed utility wi wi which is the shortlisters possibly biased estimate of wi The shortlister selects n m candidates with the highest observed utility For example in the context of peer-review the latent utility of a candidate could be their total publications and the observed utility could be the total weight the reviewer assigns to the publications impact points in They model implicit bias as a multiplicative factor where the observed utility is wi B wi if i Gb and wi B wi if i Ga characterize conditions on and the distribution where Rooney rule increases the total utility of the selection However before the shortlisting phase applicants or potential candidates must be identified and ranked For example LinkedIn Recruiter predicts a candidates likelihood of being hired from their activity Koru Hire analyzes a candidates derived personality traits to generate a fit score and HireVue grades candidates to produce an insight score In a ranking the candidates are ordered in lieu of an intervention by their observed utilities and the utility of a ranking is defined by a weighted sum of the latent utilities of the ranked candidates where the weight decreases the farther down the ranking a candidate is placed Such weighting when evaluating rankings is common practice and due to the fact that candidates placed lower in the list receive a lower attention as compared to those placed higher this translates into being less likely to be shortlisted and contributing less to the total utility of the hiring process Therefore it becomes important to consider interventions to mitigate bias in the ranking phase and understand their effectiveness in improving the rankings latent utility Can we construct simple and interpretable interventions that increase the latent utility of rankings in the presence of implicit bias Our contributions We consider the setting where items to be ranked may belong to multiple intersectional groups and present a straightforward generalization of the implicit bias model in for this setting We consider a set of interventions phrased in terms of constraints for the ranking problem which require that a fixed number of candidates from the under privileged groups be represented in the top positions in the ranking for all We show that for any input to the ranking problem ie any set of utilities or bias there is an intervention as above that leads to optimal latent utility Theorem We then prove a structural result about the optimal ranking when all the utilities are drawn from the same distribution making no assumption on the distribution itself Theorem This theorem gives a simple Rooney Rule-like intervention for ranking in the case when there are two groups For some require that in the top positions there are at least items from the underprivileged group We then show that when the utilities are drawn from the uniform distribution the latent utility of a ranking that maximizes the biased utility but is subject to our constraints for an appropriate is close to that of the optimal latent utility Theorem We evaluate the performance of ranking under our constraints empirically on two real-world datasets the IIT-JEE dataset see Section and the Semantics Scholar dataset see Section E in the Supplementary Material In both cases we observe that our simple constraints significantly improve the latent utility of the ranking and in fact attain near-optimal latent utility Finally while we phrase these results in the context of implicit bias such interventions would be effective whenever the observed utilities are systematically biased against a particular group Related work There is a large body of work on studying the effects of bias in rankings and designing algorithms for fair rankings see eg We refer the reader to the excellent talk by Castillo that gives an overview of work on fairness and transparency in rankings A significant portion of these works are devoted to generating unbiased rankings For example several approaches strive to learn the latent utilities of items and output a ranking according to the learned values In contrast we do not strive to learn the latent utilities rather to find a ranking that is close to that given by the unknown ranking according to the unknown latent utilities A different approach instead considers constraints on the placement of individuals within the ranking depending on their group status eg enforcing that at least x of the top candidates be non-male These works take the constraints as input and develop algorithms to find the optimal feasible ranking While we also use constraints in our approach our goal differs we strive to show that such constraints can recover the optimal latent utility ranking and where possible derive the appropriate constraints that achieve this Constraints which guarantee representation across various groups have been studied in a number of works on fairness across various applications most relevantly in works on forms of subset selection and ranking The primary goals of these works is to design fast algorithms that satisfy the constraints towards satisfying certain definitions of fairness these fairness goals are given exogenously and the utilities are assumed to be unbiased In contrast we begin with the premise that the utilities are systematically incorrect due to implicit bias and use the constraints to mitigate the effect of these biases when constructing a ranking Our goal is to determine how to construct effective interventions rather than on the algorithm for solving the constraints in fact we use some of the works above as a black box for the subroutine of finding a ranking once the constraints have been determined Studying implicit and explicit biases is a rich field in psychology where studies propose several mechanisms for origins of biases and analyze present-day factors which can influence them We point the reader to Greenwald and Banajis seminal work on implicit biases and the excellent treatise by Whitley and Kite for an overview of the field We consider one model of implicit bias inspired by however other relevant models may exist and exploring other kinds of bias and models for capturing them could lead to interesting expansions of this work RANKING PROBLEM BIAS MODEL AND INTERVENTIONS Ranking problem In the classical ranking problem one is given m items where item i has utility wi from which a ranked list of n m items has to be outputted A ranking is a one to one mapping from the set of items m to the set of positions n It is sometimes convenient to let x denote a binary assignment matrix representing a ranking where xi if the i-th item is placed at position and is otherwise Define a position-based discount v where an item placed at position n contributes a latent utility The latent utility obtained by placing an item i at position is then It is assumed that for all n implying that the same item derives a higher utility at a lower position This is satisfied by popularly studied position-based discounts such as discounted cumulative gain DCG where B and its variants and Zipfian where B Then given v we define the latent utility of a ranking x as B i m n xi Latent utility The goal of the ranking problem is to find a ranking equivalently an assignment that maximizes the latent utility argmax The reason the utility above is called latent is as is shortly discussed in the presence of implicit bias the perceived utility may be different from the latent utility Note that subset selection is a special case of the ranking problem when for all n Groups and a model for implicit bias Items may belong to one or more of intersectional ie not necessarily disjoint groups GG Each m and may not be empty for s t The perceived or observed utility of group items in may be different from their latent utility And items that belong to multiple groups may be subject to multiple implicit biases as has been observed To mathematically model this we consider a model of implicit bias introduced by by which is motivated from empirical findings of For two disjoint groups Ga Gb m given an implicit bias parameter they defined the observed utility as wi B wi if i Ga if i Gb Observed utility To extend this model to the case of multiple intersectional groups for each s p we assume an implicit bias parameter Since it is natural to expect that items at the intersection of multiple groups encounter a higher bias we define their implicit bias parameter as the product of the implicit biases of each group the item belongs to Formally the observed utility wi of item i m is wi B s p i wi It follows that the case of two disjoint groups Ga Gb is a special case let and Intervention constraints In the presence of implicit bias the ranking problem then results in finding the assignment matrix x that maximizes the observed utility v Thus not only does it result in adverse outcomes for groups for which it also follows that optimizing this utility as such may be sub-optimal for the overall goal of finding a utility maximizing rank To see this note that if x is the assignment that maximizes v the value of the latent utility derived from it may be much less Motivated by the Rooney Rule and its efficacy as an intervention in the subset selection problem we investigate if there are constraints that can be added to the optimization problem of finding a ranking that maximizes the observed utilities that results in a ranking in which the latent utility is much higher possibly even optimal max As a class of potential interventions we consider lower bound constraints on the number of items from a particular group s p selected in the top-k positions of the ranking for all positions n More specifically given L Z we consider the following constraints on rankings assignments n s p i xi We will sometimes refer to these constraints as L-constraints Let KL B x x satisfies L-constraints be the set of all rankings satisfying the L-constraint Our goal will be to consider various L-constraints and understand under what conditions on the input utilities and bias parameters does the ranking x B argmax x v have the property close to max Constraints such as have been studied by a number of works on fairness including by several works on ranking While these constraints can encapsulate a variety of fairness and diversity metrics their effectiveness as an intervention for implicit biases was not clear and the utility of the rankings generated remained ill-understood prior to this work THEORETICAL RESULTS Notation Let Z be a random variable We use n to represent the k-th order statistic the k-th largest value from n iid draws of Z For all a b define to be the uniform distribution on ab More generally for an interval I R let be the uniform distribution on I Let x B argmax be the ranking that maximizes the latent utility L-constraints are sufficient to recover optimal latent utility Our first result is structural and shows that the class of L-constraints defined above are expressive enough to recover the optimal latent utility while optimizing observed utility constrained to certain specific L Z Theorem Given a set of latent utilities wi m i there exists constraints such that for all implicit bias parameters p s p the optimal constrained ranking x B argmax x v satisfies max Without additional assumptions necessarily depends see Fact D in the Supplementary material A set of utility-independent constraints is often preferable due to its simplicity and interpretability our next two results take steps in this direction by making assumptions about distributions from which the utilities are drawn Proof sketch of Theorem Consider the following constraints For Recall that x B argmax is a function of We claim that satisfy the claim in the theorem The proof proceeds in two steps First we show that x is the same as x up to the groups of items at each position Let Ti B s i be the set of groups i belongs to This proof relies on the fact that the observed utility of an item is always smaller than its latent utility and that for any two items i i m if Ti Ti and wi wi then wi wi Using these we show that for each position n under the chosen L-constraints it is optimal to greedily place item i m that has the highest observed utility and satisfies the constraints In the next step we show that x has the same latent utility as x from a contradiction We show that if the claim is satisfied for the first n positions then we can swap two candidates i and i such that Ti Ti to satisfy the claim for the first positions without loosing latent utility Here we use the fact for any two items i i m if Ti Ti and wi wi then wi wi ie the relative order of items in the same set of groups does not change whether we rank them by their observed utility as in x or their latent utility as in x The proof of Theorem is presented in Section Distribution independent constraints We now study the problem of coming up with constraints that do not depend on the utilities Towards this we consider the setting of two disjoint groups Ga Gb m let ma B Ga B Gb be the sizes of Ga and Gb We assume that the latent utility Wi for all items i Ga Gb is iid and drawn from some distribution D This model is equivalent to the one considered by except that they fix D to be in the family of power-law distributions whereas our result in this section holds for any distribution D The optimal ranking will sort the utilities wi i m in a decreasing order breaking ties arbitrarily if necessary For all mb let m be the random variable representing the position of the ℓ-th item from Gb in the optimal ranking Let be the random variable that counts the number of items belonging to Gb in the first positions of the optimal ranking The following result reveals the structure of the optimal ranking when there is no implicit bias and is used in the next subsection to design utility-independent constraints Theorem Let D be a continuous distribution mb and min ma mb be a position then Pr e But this does neither affects the latent utility nor the observed utility Note that this result is independent of the distribution D and only requires D to be a continuous probability distribution The above equations show that with high probability the optimal ranking has items from Gb in the top-k positions and in expectation it places these items at equal distances in the first positions for all n This observation motivates the following simple constraints Simple constraints Given a number we define the constraints as follows For all n and Rooney Rule like constraints Note that the only non-trivial constraint is These constraints are easy to interpret and can be seen as generalization of the Rooney Rule to the ranking setting Proof sketch of Theorem Here we discuss the distributional independence of Theorem and present its proof in Section For all i d D be the random utility of the i-th item drawn from D and FD be the cumulative distribution function of D Then the independence follows from the straightforward facts that for all D FD wi d U here is one place it is used that D is continuous and that FD being a cdf is a monotone function From these it follows that argmax v wi m i argmax v FD wi m i Thus we can replace the all Wi s by FD wi without changing the optimal ranking Optimal latent utility from simple constraints for uniform distributions In this section we study the effect of the simple constraints mentioned in the previous subsection when D is the uniform distribution on for the setting of two disjoint groups Ga Gb m with and We discuss how these arguments could be extended to other bounded distributions in the remarks following Theorem and empirically study the increase in utility for a non-bounded distribution in Section Define the expected utility as B E where for each draw x B argmax x v and wi wi if i Ga and wi if i Gb Sometimes we drop the subscripts D and v if they are clear from the context Theorem Given a if D B U v satisfies Assumptions and with min ma mb then for B mb then adding Lα-constraints achieve nearly optimal latent utility in expectation On nn v n Roughly these assumptions mean that the position discounts be much larger than the difference between between the discounts of two consecutive positions These are mild assumptions and are satisfied by several commonly studied position discounts including DCG for and inverse polynomial discount where B kc and c for c A few remarks are in order When for all n then we can derive the following explicit expressions of the utility assuming ma mb n Utility with constraints n n ma mb O Utility without constraints ma ma mb c n n n ma O c n Where we define c B ma Choosing in Equation we can see that the optimal latent utility from a ranking of n items is n o and that the constraints achieve this utility within a multiplicative factor for any Therefore for all there exists an n N such that for all n n the constraints achieve nearly optimal latent utility Remark We note that our choice of B mb is independent of Thus we can achieve near optimal latent utility without the knowledge of Extending D does not change the form of the theorem We can simply scale Equations and by C In the special case of subset selection for all this theorem answers the open problem in regarding the ℓ-th order Rooney rule for the uniform distribution Proof sketch of Theorem To calculate we partition the items from Ga into those with a high utility in and all others with utility in Items with a high utility are always selected before any item from gb The number of such items Na is a sum n random variables indicating if the utility is in Therefore Na has a binomial distribution Binomial n Conditioned on Na we can show that the distribution of observed utilities of all remaining items including those from gb is the same This uses the fact that a uniform random variable conditioned to lie in an sub-interval is uniform Using this symmetry we can show that the number of items selected from Gb Nb follows a hypergeometric distribution conditioned on Na This gives us a value for conditioned on Na To do away with the conditioning we derive approximations to the negative moments of the binomial distribution To upperbound the difference we use a coupling argument and the concentration properties of the hypergeometric distribution to show that the difference in positions of any item i between the constrained and the unconstrained ranking is with high probability Using Assumptions and with the boundedness of the utility gives us a lower bound of n n Further using the fact that n the theorem follows by choosing To find an explicit expression of in the special case when we use a coupling argument to show that if the unconstrained ranking picks fewer than items from gb then the constrained selects exactly items from both Ga and Gb Using the distribution of Nb for the unconstrained case we can show that this occurs with high probability as long as note the strict inequality Then using the boundedness of the utility we show is twice the sum of expected utility of the highest order statistics in n draws which gives us the required expression The proof of Theorem in presented in Section B of the supplementary material Remark We expect similar strategy would give us bounds on other bounded distributions as well We provide some evidence in favor of this for a naturally occurring bounded distribution in Section However when D is an unbounded distribution we cannot ignore events with a low probability and other techniques might be required to estimate the utilities On a positive note we still observe an increase in utility for the unbounded lognormal distribution in our empirical study Section EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS We examine the effect of our constraints on naturally occurring distributions of utilities derived from scores in the IIT-JEE dataset and Gb representing male and female candidates respectively and note that that the distributions of utilities of two groups are very similar in Section In Section we consider the situation in which these scores accurately capture a candidates latent utility Gb say during a job interview affects the interpretation of the the score of these candidates We simulate this implicit bias by shading the distribution of utilities for candidates in Gb by a constant multiplicative factor We then measure the effectiveness of our constraints by comparing the latent utilities of Cons Our proposed ranking which uses constraints to correct for implicit bias Uncons An unconstrained ranking Opt The optimal unattainable ranking that maximizes the unobserved due to implicit bias utilities In Section we consider the situation in which the scores themselves encode systematic biases and consider the effectiveness of our constrained ranking as a potential intervention In particular we contrast our approach with a recent intervention used in IIT admissions Supernumerary which was created to increase the representation of women at IITs Dataset JEE scores Indian Institutes of Technology IITs are a group of institutes of higher-education which are arguably the most prestigious engineering schools in India into the IITs are decided solely on the basis of the scores attained in Research Corpus which we present in Section E of the Supplementary Material code all of their entries as either male or female the Joint Entrance Exam JEE Advanced known as IIT-JEE in IIT-JEE is conducted once every year and only students that have graduated from high school in the previous two years are eligible Out of the candidates who took IIT-JEE in only candidates were admitted to an IIT In the same year women of the total appeared in the exam yet only were admitted into an IIT less than of the admitted Figure Distributions of Scores in IIT-JEE Distribution of total scores of all male and all female candidates Men and women have similar distributions of total scores with a total variation distance of a Db The dataset consists of scores of candidates from IIT-JEE which was released in response to a Right to Information application filed in June This dataset contains the scores of students in each of the Math Physics and Chemistry sections of IIT-JEE along with the students gender given as a binary label women and men their birth category see and zip code The candidates are scored on a scale from to points in all three sections with an average total score of a maximum score of and a minimum score of While the statistics of IIT JEE admissions are not available if roughly the same number of students were admitted in as in then students with a score above would have been admitted Distribution of scores across groups We found that the Johnsons SU -distribution gave a good fit for the distribution of scores These fitted distributions of scores of women and men Db and Da are depicted in Figure The two distributions are very similar their total-variation distance is Db ie the two distributions differ on less than of their probability mass However the mean of men standard deviation is considerably higher than the mean of women standard deviation Effectiveness of constraints We now evaluate the effectiveness of the constraints as an intervention for implicit bias see Section For this evaluation we assume that the JEE scores represent the true latent utility of a candidate and we assume these scores are distributed for male and female students according to the fitted distributions Da and Db respectively We then consider the case where students ma from group Ga from group Gb apply to a job where the hiring manager has implicit bias against group Gb Here Uncons would rank the candidates according to the biased utilities Opt would rank the candidates according to their latent utilities which is a priori impossible due to the implicit bias and the proposed solution Cons would provide the optimal constrained ranking satisfying constraint parameter using the fast-greedy algorithm described in More formally the rankings are Uncons B argmax v Cons B argmax x v Opt B argmax We report the average latent utilities and obtained by Cons Uncons and Opt respectively see Equation for the definition of Parameters We let m ma mb B B B and vary the implicit bias parameter and mb In the JEE dataset mb is a representative number The position discount corresponds to DCG which is popularly used in practice We vary from to ie from no constraint to the case where half of the candidates in the ranking must be from group Gb We report the average latent utilities we take the average over trials in Table Results We observe that the constraint intervention can significantly increase the latent utility of the ranking even when Da and Db are non-uniform and are not exactly the same The extent of the improvement depends both on the degree of implicit bias and the fraction of the underrepresented group that appears in the dataset As expected from Theorem there exists an for which the latent utility from the optimal ranking can be attained More generally we observe that the constraints increase the latent utility when is such that it ensures no more than proportional representation ie when the constraint ensures that the ranking reflects the group percentages in the underlying population even when the bias parameter is small We conduct similar simulations without a discounting factor ie with just selection with no ranking and observe similar results in Section E in the Supplementary Material We also observe similar results on the Semantic Scholar Research Corpus where the distributions are heavy tailed and hence constitute a very different class of utilities see Section E in the Supplementary Material Overall these findings suggest that the intervention is robust and across different latent utility distributions population sizes and extent of bias and that the exact parameters need not be known to develop successful interventions IIT supernumerary seats for women If we assume that the scores of the candidates are a true measure of their academic potential then any scheme which increases the number of underrepresented candidates admitted is bound to decrease the average potential of candidates at the institute However among candidates of equal potential those from an underprivileged group are known to perform poorer on standardized tests In India fewer girls than boys attend primary school many of whom are forced to drop-out of schools to help with work at home or get married Therefore we expect a female student who has the same score as a male student say in Table Empirical Results on IIT-JEE Dataset With plot the latent utilities obtained by Cons Uncons and Opt respectively see Equation for the definition we average over values over mb of the underprivileged group to the size ma of the privileged group The bar represents the optimal constraint where we require the ranking to place at least candidates in the top positions of the ranking for every position We note that our constraints attain close to the optimal latent utility for the right choice of More notably they significantly outperform the unconstrained setting for a wide range of lending robustness to the approach Even when there is no observed bias adding constraints does not appear to significantly impact the utility of the ranking unless the constraints are very strong IIT-JEE to perform better than the boy if admitted This is a societal bias which while different in nature than implicit bias is another reason through which utilities can be systematically wrong against a particular group Hence the constraint approach presented is equally applicable as we illustrate in this section In effect it means that the scores are in fact biased and the true latent utility of a candidate from gb is in fact larger than what is reflected from their score To account for this and improve the representation of women in IITs in additional supernumerary seats for women were introduced This increases the capacity of all majors in all IITs by creating additional seats which are reserved for women such that women compose at least of each major without decreasing the number of non-female candidates admitted More formally if the original capacity of a major at an IIT and the average number of females admitted in this major in the past few years was nf then the scheme created x additional seats such that nf x B Where nf x seats are reserved for females and the other Cnf seats are open to candidates of all genders Eligible women are granted admission on reserved seat first and only when all reserved seats are filled a women admitted on a gender neutral seat Setup We assume the number of slots available in a given year for the IITs is n B a candidate from group Gb is given by a shift such that if they attain a score sf then a true score would be s B sf distribution D b with the same mean as Da Let the supernumerary scheme admit n candidates We know that Sup always admits more candidates than our constraints approach and the unconstrained approach Uncons both of which choose n candidates As such it would be unfair to compare the average utility of the candidate selected by Sup with that of or Uncons We define two more rankings and Uncons which given an select candidates and are otherwise equivalent to and Uncons which had the number of IITs as We allocate n seats using the simple constraints scheme Cons and Uncons and n seats using and Uncons and compare the average latent utilities of the candidates admitted by the scheme Here we define the average latent utility from scheme A which admits nA candidates as We vary from to ie from the fraction of women admitted if all candidates are admitted on basis of their scores to the value which corresponds to proportional the representation based on the number of candidates appearing in IIT-JEE We report the average latent utilities in Figure Figure Empirical Results Studying the Effect of Supernumerary Seats for Women We plot the average latent utilities of the ranking schemes we consider The y-axis represents the utility per candidate and the x-axis represents the lower-bound constraint Our constrained interventions outperform the unconstrained variants up to approximately female seats and always outperforms the existing supernumerary approach used in practice Results We observe that the always has an lower average utility that scheme We note that the and the always select the same number of candidates The difference is that could place all the underprivileged candidates at the end of the ranking while places at least underprivileged candidates every positions We find that for any decreases the average latent utility of the admitted candidates Finally we observe that for a range of from to Cons increases the average latent utility of the admitted candidates over Uncons and increases the latent utility over Uncons ie for all U U Uncons U U Uncons The optimal constraint for is argmax U Intuitively can increase the average utility by swapping a male candidate i Ga and female candidate Gb such that wi Note that in additional candidates selected from gb compete against the lowest scoring candidates from gb in the ranking instead of the average utility U as in Remark Since was not designed to optimize the average utility it is not surprising that outperforms in our experiment However the goal of this experiment is to study the effect our constraints approach against systematic biases different from implicit bias by qualitatively comparing them an existing scheme DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS One could also consider other approaches to mitigate implicit bias For instance in a setting where an interviewer ranks the candidates we could ask interviewers to self-correct rescale their implicit bias However anti-bias training which aims to correct peoples implicit bias has been shown to have limited efficacy Thus even with training we do not have a guarantee that the interviewer can self-correct effectively Adding interventions like the ones we consider do not require individuals to self-correct their perceptions Instead we could ask interviewers to report their observed utilities and later rescale them However we may not have an accurate estimate of As the interventions we consider are independent of in Theorem they can be applied in such a setting and would still recover the optimal utility see Remark Furthermore if interviewers are explicitly biased they can give arbitrarily low scores to one group of candidates this would make any rescaling attempt insufficient By instead requiring a fixed number of candidates from each group the interventions we consider are also robust against explicit bias and perhaps this is why simple versions have been used in practice eg Rooney rule We crucially note that any such intervention will only have a positive end effect if the goal is sincere a hiring manager who is biased against a group of people can simply not hire a person from that group regardless of what ranking they are given or what representation is enforced throughout the interview process Interventions such as the one we describe here are a robust approach to correct for certain kinds of biases but are only a single step in the process and alone cannot suffice It would be important to evaluate this approach as part of the larger ecosystem in which it is used in order to adequately measure its efficacy in practice CONCLUSION We consider a type of constraint-based interventions for re-ordering biased rankings derived from utilities with systematic biases against a particular socially salient group The goal of these interventions is to recover to the best of our ability the unbiased ranking that would have resulted from the true latent unbiased utilities We consider a theoretical model of implicit bias and study the effect of such interventions on rankings in this setting We show that this family of constraint-based interventions are sufficient to mitigate implicit bias under this model in other words a ranking with the optimal latent utility can be recovered using this kind of intervention However the optimal parameters of the intervention depend on the specific utilities Towards understanding this further we make a natural assumption that the utilities are drawn from a fixed distribution and show that simple constraints recover the optimal utility under this bias model We focus on specific distributions but believe that similar theoretical bounds would exist for other bounded distributions as discussed in Section Rigorously analyzing necessary properties of distributions for which such bounds hold would be an interesting direction for future work This class of interventions is robust against explicit bias see Section Their robustness is further supported by our empirical findings in which we find that there exist optimal constraints for which the optimal latent utility is almost attained in expectation Importantly we find that the interventions are near-optimal even when the distributions are unbounded eg lognormal distributions see Section E in the Supplementary Material Further the interventions remain near-optimal even when the latent utility distribution of the underprivileged group is similar but not identical to that of the privileged group see Section More generally we observe that the intervention improves the latent utility of the ranking for a wide range of with the highest improvement roughly centered around proportional representation This gives an interesting rule of thumb but more importantly shows the robustness of the method without knowing the exact optimal one can still improve the rankings latent utility significantly From these observations we expect this class of constraint-based intervention to be successful for a wide class of settings exploring its limitations and developing clear guidelines on when and how to use the interventions in a particular use case would be an important avenue for further work In this work we pose the problem in terms of implicit biases However the source of the bias is not important our results hold as long as there is systematic bias against one group as captured by our model in Section We briefly discuss a different type of social bias in Section However we crucially note that any such intervention will only have a positive end effect if the goal is sincere see Section Lastly we note that while we phrase the majority of our results in light of rankings they also have implications for the subset selection problem where a group must be chosen but need not be ordered by taking the discounting factor for all positions n This in effect eliminates the importance of the order and the total utility depends only on the set of people or items selected In particular our results answers a question asked in on the efficacy of the ℓ-th order Rooney Rule when the distribution of utilities is uniform We further report empirical results for subset selection which follow the setup and conclusions discussed in Section E in the Supplementary Material Hence simple constraint-based interventions appear to be highly effective and robust for a wide variety of biases distributions and settings it is our hope that they be adopted and studied further as a simple yet powerful tool to help combat biases in a variety of applications PROOFS Proof of Theorem Theorem Restatement of Theorem Given a set of latent utilities wi m i there exists constraints such that for all implicit bias parameters p s p the optimal constrained ranking x B argmax x v satisfies max Proof Let m n be the observed utility maximizing ranking and m n be the optimal latent utility maximizing ranking where we define i B n and B n if item i was not ranked in the first n positions of or We claim that the following constraints are suitable for Theorem For all s p and n B t We will prove that under these constraints and are the same up to the groups of the items ranked at each position The following lemma shows that they also have the same latent utility Lemma If for all n where are such that and ie and are the same up to the groups of the items ranked at each position then and have the same latent utility Proof We show that the relative order of all items with different latent utilities is the same between the two rankings proving that they have the same latent utility Consider two items i and i in the same set of groups ie such that Ti Ti We note that swapping their positions does not violate any new constraints Further since i and i have the same implicit bias we have Ti Ti wi wi wi Towards a contradiction assume that and have different relative order of i and i Without loss of generality let and i i Since is optimal we wi If wi wi then these items do not change the latent utility between and wi from Equation we have that wi wi Therefore we can swap the positions of i and i in to gain the following observed utility i i i i wi wi i i This contradicts the fact that has the optimal observed utility It remains to prove that with these constraints is the same as up to the groups of the items This proof is by induction Inductive hypothesis Let the two rankings agree on the first positions up to the groups of the item ranked at each position Base case The base case for is trivially satisfied Towards a contradiction assume that the items on the k-th positions of and are i and i m such that Ti Ti Since ranks i after i it follows that wi wi Case A Ti Ti We claim that this case is not possible Consider any group for s TiTi Since the rankings agree on the first positions we have for all Therefore in this case violates the constraint at position Case B Ti Ti In this case we have Consider the ranking formed by swapping the position of i and i in The change in observed utility between and is i i i i wi wi i i Therefore has higher observed utility than Therefore if satisfies the constraints then this contradicts the optimality of and we are done can only violate the constraints in positions i for groups TiTi Since the number of items selected from the set of groups TiTi only increases It follows that if satisfies the lower bound constraints on positions i then so does Since we assume to be feasible we are done Proof of Theorem Theorem Restatement of Theorem be a continuous distribution mb and min ma mb be a position then Pr e Equivalent Simple Model Since the items have the same distribution D of latent utility the event i Ga or equivalently i Gb is independent of the event wi z for some z Therefore the latent utility maximizing ranking is independent of the groups assigned to each item It follows that the following is an equivalent model of generating the unbiased ranking First we draw ma mb latent utilities and order them in a non-increasing order randomly breaking ties Then we choose mb items uniformly without replacement and assign them and assign the others toGa Let a item i Gb be a blue ball and i Ga be a red ball then distributions of positions of the balls is equivalent to Given ma mb numbered balls we pick mb of them uniformly without replacement and color them blue and color the rest of the balls red Proof Using the above model we first find that has a negative-hypergeometric distribution and use it to calculate then we find that is a hypergeometric distribution use this fact to calculate and show is concentrated around its mean Expectation of The total ways of choosing mb blue balls mb Given the number of ways of choosing the blue balls before it is and the number of ways of choosing the b blue balls after it is Therefore by expressing the
