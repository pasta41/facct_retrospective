Integrating FATE/Critical Data Studies into Data Science Curricula Where are we going and how do we get there There have been multiple calls for integrating topics related to fairness accountability transparency ethics FATE and social justice into Data Science curricula but little exploration of how this might work in practice This paper presents the findings of a collaborative auto-ethnography CAE engaged in by a MSc Data Science teaching team based at University of Sheffield UK Information School where FATE/Critical Data Studies CDS topics have been a core part of the curriculum since  In this paper we adopt the CAE approach to reflect on our experiences of working at the intersection of disciplines and our progress and future plans for integrating FATE/CDS into the curriculum We identify a series of challenges for deeper FATE/CDS integration related to our own competencies and the wider socio-material context of Higher Education in the UK We conclude with recommendations for ourselves and the wider FATE/CDS orientated Data Science community CONCEPTS Social and professional topics Computing education KEYWORDS data science FATE critical data studies higher education INTRODUCTION The number of Data Science degrees has expanded significantly in the last five years eg largely in response to growing demand from employers for data literate graduates Despite disciplinary differences in general terms Data Science is understood to be the computational and quantitative analysis of large datasets to create information and knowledge p using scientifically rigorous methodologies frameworks and tools Alongside this expansion in Data Science degrees there have been increasing calls for Data Science curricula to embed training in topics related to Fairness Accountability Transparency and Ethics FATE eg as well as to develop students critical awareness of the power dynamics and potential social consequences of applied Data Science as examined in Critical Data Studies CDS Such calls echo growing concerns among academics developers policy makers and the public about the individual and societal consequences of existing and emergent forms of applied Data Science Since  the authors of this paper the MSc Data Science programme team based at the University of Sheffield UK have been actively engaged in a multi-disciplinary collaboration that works to embed FATE/CDS topics into the delivery of a Data Science Masters programme In this paper we report the findings of a collaborative auto-ethnography that our teaching team engaged in with the aim of taking stock of our efforts so far reflecting on our approach to working at the intersection of disciplines and how this influences how FATE/CDS are integrated into our curriculum and what challenges and opportunities there are for deepening this integration in future years This paper is structured as follows In Section we first provide a literature review to set our work into context In Section we outline the research methodology of our work and present our main findings in Section Section concludes this work BACKGROUND The Growth of Data Science Degrees The process of datafication that can be observed in many sectors over the last decade has led to an as yet unsatisfied demand for skilled data specialists across industry and the public sector Within the domain of higher education rapid curriculum change aimed at addressing these workforce needs can be observed within a number of specialisms including Information Schools and Computer Science DeVeaux et als paper p reports programmes in Data Science and related fields taught at over universities worldwide and the ACM Data Science Task Force p predicts the number of programmes and the number of students wanting to study them will increase Song and Zhus analysis of undergraduate and postgraduate Data Science programmes in the US observed more Masters than Bachelors degrees and that Information Science departments offered the largest number of programmes followed by departments of Computer Science and Statistics During the iSchools that made up the iSchool consortium offered a total of data-related degrees and of these were data specific degrees offered at Masters level half of which were Data Science degrees p As Ortiz-Repiso et al observe that Information Schools have moved in this space is unsurprising given core processes of information science collecting organising managing accessing and supporting the use and manipulation of information are acutely relevant to data-driven disciplinary areas such as data science p Within the emerging literature on Data Science curricula there is a clear distinction between Information Science and Computer Science driven approaches to the subject Computer Science teaches computing with more emphasis on fundamental elements such as data structures algorithms computational theory and computing models On the other hand information computing in iSchools should emphasize users tools and applications p p This difference maps well onto the distinction Tierney makes between Type technical experts and Type data scientists who have some knowledge of a variety of Data Science techniques but are more orientated towards user needs acting as a translator between the business problem and the technical environment necessary to deliver what is needed The multi-disciplinary nature of iSchools and their emphasis on the interrelations between information people and technology Song and Zhu argue makes them well placed to educate successful data scientists equipped with diverse skills with broad perspectives probably the most ideal institutions for teaching user-based and application-focused data science education p a perspective echoed by Ortiz-Repiso et al FATE/CDS in Data Science Curricula Despite these potential strengths of the iSchools in delivering a FATE/CDS oriented Data Science curriculum there is little engagement with these issues within the existing research literature In the disciplines educational literature on Data Science FATE/CDS topics tend to receive little more than a mention in a list of relevant topics Most iSchool curricula emphasize concepts such as social aspects of information such as ethics of big data and data science security and privacy issues p Data science has greater variety than big data analytics with courses such as the semantic web metadata data curation cognitive science and data management and ethics p Further some in the field have observed that while Library and Information Science has much to offer too often as iSchools have shifted towards offering Data Science and related programmes their social orientation has been steadily eroded in favor of the same harvesting hoarding mining and manipulation that were once the exclusive domain of computer science programs A similar level of engagement with FATE/CDS topics is observed in the wider non-LIS research on Data Science curricula eg Wilder and Ozgur and Anderson et al Whereas in some accounts FATE/CDS topics are noticeably absent eg Baumers description of an experimental Data Science curriculum at a US institution This body of research reflects the results of a recent ACM international academic survey about Data Science curricula which discovered only of Data Science programmes required content on ethics with no other socially orientated topics identified and only had a Data Science in context requirement a component in which ethical considerations may have been necessary As the number of Data Science programmes offered by universities has increased there have been various efforts to establish model curricula and a set of common competencies at undergraduate and postgraduate levels eg In this paper we will not elaborate on the technical aspects of these competency frameworks only to observe a difference in the depth of computational and mathematical knowledge expected within proposals emerging from different disciplines Our interest in this paper is the emphasis on competencies relating to FATE/CDS within these frameworks and proposed curricula With a specific focus on iSchool Data Science curriculum development Song and Zhu argue that iSchools should take advantage of their existing emphasis on social aspects of information However despite their acknowledgement of the iSchools strengths in this area there is no mention of FATE/CDS topics in their paper Big Data and Data Science what should we teach The European EDISON Data Science Model Curriculum published in release on the other hand does include consideration of ethical issues across a range of different competencies and also more specifically the importance of responsible data use data privacy ethical principles legal issues p However there is no mention of bias transparency fairness justice or the potential social implications of some forms of Data Science practice Similarly the US-based Business Higher Education Forum argued that Data Governance and Ethics framed as Identifying data governance obligations and challenges and emerging legal and ethical data privacy and security best practices and uncertainties within a given context p should be a core competency for Data Science graduates Around the same time faculty participants in the US-based Park City initiative observed that given the new ethical challenges posed by Data Science capabilities curricula should feature exposure to and ethical training in areas such as citation and data ownership security and sensitivity of data consequences and privacy concerns of data analysis and the professionalism of transparency and reproducibility p Nonetheless while such challenges are recognised these topics are absent from the proposed course structure More recently the US-based National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine NASEMs p work on envisioning an undergraduate Data Science curricula recommends that A key goal is to give all students the ability to make good judgments use tools responsibly and effectively and ultimately make good decisions using data Ethics is a topic that given the nature of data science students should learn and practice throughout their education Academic institutions should ensure that ethics is woven into the data science curriculum from the beginning and throughout Building upon these various efforts to map out competencies for Data Science students the ACM Data Science Task Forces draft guidance goes further addressing a number of FATE-relevant topics that graduates ought to be able to demonstrate competency in These include privacy and confidentiality legality intellectual property transparency and accountability in algorithms and techniques for establishing whether a dataset or algorithm is biased The report also observes Students of Data Science need to be imbued with the joy of data seeing data as the currency or fuel of our time They also need to be imbued with a strong sense of professional and ethical responsibility Data Science courses ought to reflect such sentiments likewise the education of data scientists p It is evident that there is a growing recognition of the necessity to embed FATE/CDS related topics into Data Science curricula However as Leonelli observes research on integrating ethical safeguards into Data Science practice is relatively limited in scope noting a particular focus on issues of consent This observation is somewhat echoed in the frameworks outlined above with recommendations tending to focus on compliance with ethical and legal frameworks and notions of transparency and accountability Leonelli stresses that while these concerns are important the focus sidesteps two crucial ethical issues the implications of largescale data integration on social groups and communities whose characteristics and identity are sometimes easily retrievable and how Data Scientists could and/or should be made accountable for the decisions they take in their work p Leonellis concerns begin to touch upon wider trends within Critical Data Studies and cognate fields which have tended to emphasise the power dynamics of emergent data practices through concepts such as Data Justice Data Power Algorithms of Oppression and Data Feminism These understandings have been advanced by scholars in the social sciences and humanities who have argued that the societal implications of applied Data Science are better addressed through frameworks centred upon understandings of power justice oppression rather than the more technically resolvable issues of ethics bias transparency etc It is such an approach that scholars such as Bates et al and Neff et al have called for in their arguments for embedding Critical Data Studies within Data Science curricula While the above literature evidence a range of calls for embedding FATE/CDS into Data Science curricula as yet there is a lack of literature on what this might mean in practice and what the challenges are of building multi-disciplinary teams capable of delivering high-quality teaching that integrates both the technical and social justice dimensions of Data Science The following sections will go on to describe how our team based at the Sheffield Information School have approached this issue since launching our Data Science programme in academic year  Sheffield Information Schools Data Science Programme The Data Science programme delivered by the Information School at University of Sheffield is a one-year full time Master of Science degree which can also be studied part time over two years The Information School and therefore the Data Science programme are based in the Faculty of Social Sciences The programme explicitly aims to train Type Data Scientists that is data scientists who have some knowledge of a variety of data science techniques but are more orientated towards the user needs acting as a translator between the business problem and the technical environment necessary to deliver what is needed The programme was launched in  and has experienced significant growth in student numbers since its inception As shown in Table this growth in student numbers is based on increased recruitment of international students particularly Chinese students Year Number Fee status  UK EU INT  UK EU INT  UK EU INT  UK EU INT  UK EU INT Table Numbers and fee status of registered students The course is credits made up of credit modules and a -credit dissertation Some of these modules are compulsory core and others are optional electives The initial and current module structure is presented in Table The Data and Society module is the most FATE/CDS relevant module It is a core module that runs in the st semester It is taught from a Critical Data Studies perspective and adopts a constructivist pedagogy to explore issues relating to Conceptualisations of power structure and agency and how they relate to Data Science and the production of knowledge Philosophical debates related to production of knowledge from data Politics of data visualisation and algorithmic processing eg bias transparency surveillance etc Data citizenship and agency Legal aspects of processing personal data GDPR Ethical reasoning for data science practice applying insights from the above topics The growth in student numbers has also meant an increase and diversification of academic staff teaching on the programme since  As seen in Table the composition of the teaching team is diverse in disciplinary background Working at the intersection of disciplines The literature points to significant advantages for students in being exposed to ideas and knowledge from differing disciplinary and cultural perspectives Learning is understood to be triggered in the third-spaces at the boundaries of disciplines cultures and  first year  Introduction to Data Science credits Introduction to Data Science credits Data Analysis

Human-Computer Interaction option from  Table Core and elective modules in   social groups The Information Schools Data Science programme with its multi-disciplinary team and curriculum and international cohort of students and staff is therefore well situated in relation to opportunities for activating such forms of learning among our students Further a significant amount of the literature on researching and teaching at the intersection of disciplines emphasises institutional barriers related to the administrative challenges departmental organisation physical space etc Again our programme is well positioned in relation to such challenges given the multi-disciplinary team are co-located within a single department Nonetheless as MacLeod observes such institutional challenges are only part of what makes working at the intersection of disciplines difficult and more understanding is needed about the likely cognitive difficulties that pervade constrain and even block collaborative interdisciplinary work p As Pederson similarly observes while something of a consensus has emerged in the literature around the necessity for integrating knowledge from different disciplines the differing ontological and epistemological regimes of disciplines means that integration can become the Achilles heel of a project Such barriers to researching and teaching at the intersection of disciplines are observed in the literature with multiple concerns raised that when Social Science and Humanities SSH are brought into interdisciplinary teams it is often as an add on or as an independent project within the overall project architecture risking that SSH becomes merely an appendix to the techno-scientific disciplines Building upon such insights we became interested in opening up a conversation amongst academics teaching on the Data Science programme about how our Data Science team had evolved its approach to working at the intersection of disciplines what this means for how topics related to FATE/CDS are integrated into the curriculum and what this might mean for our graduates understanding and appreciation of such challenges METHODOLOGY We adopted a methodological approach that assumes a different ontological and epistemological position than the dominant perspective in Data Science collaborative auto-ethnography CAE combined with provocation as method This approach was selected not only because of its strengths in getting under the surface of our own practice but also its potential for fostering the kinds of open communication and reflection needed within multi-disciplinary teams Building on the research methodology of auto-ethnography the CAE approach has been defined as a qualitative research method in which researchers work in community to collect their autobiographical materials and to analyse and interpret their data collectively to gain a meaningful understanding of sociocultural phenomena reflected in their autobiographical data p  The approach has previously been used in similar context to our own to explore working at the intersections of science technology engineering and mathematics STEM and Arts The aims of CAE are to develop the groups understanding of self in socio-cultural context community building among participants and empowerment/transformation Common challenges include the logistics of contributing power dynamics in the group and participants willingness to open up With these challenges in mind principles of participation were discussed and agreed between all participants prior to the first data collection meeting and ethical approval for the research project was gained from University of Sheffield Information School All except one academic staff member on the Data Science team were actively engaged on the project The one staff member that was not engaged was supportive but did not have the time available due to undertaking a senior administrative role within the School Data collection was undertaken in three stages Three articles on teaching researching and communicating at the intersection of disciplines were selected and key quotations were selected as provocations for the team A provocations document and list of questions for individual reflection were circulated to all team members Team members were given a week to reflect on the provocations and write an individual response to the questions prior to sharing with the group Two -hour group discussion meetings The first focused on the evolution of the degree and how it sits at the intersection of disciplines the implications of this for our integration of FATE/CDS and the opportunities risks and challenges of deepening disciplinary integration The second meeting focused on our ideal approach to FATE/CDS integration pros and cons of such an approach different stakeholders perspectives and practicalities These meetings were recorded and transcribed Due to time constraints the development of the provocations and questions for individual reflection and group discussion was led by one person who had familiarity FATE/CDS Social Science/Humanities methods and some of the literature and debates around interdisciplinarity with input from other team members on an opt-in basis We adopted an analytical rather than evocative approach to our CAE data analysis and write up and a writing style and structure more familiar to ACM conference participants than some traditional CAE approaches Given tight time constraints and lack of availability of some participants during the data analysis and write-up period this stage was also led by a single group member with experience in qualitative methods with input on drafts from other participants Data collected through individual reflections and group discussions were thematically analysed Identified themes were Challenges of disciplinary integration Evolution of the programme FATE and Critical Data Studies People staff and students Data Science Curricula Overcoming challenges Each theme had a range of underlying codes related to the overall thematic concept Codes and themes were developed through a combination of data-driven and literature-driven methods FINDINGS The following section presents some of our key findings from the collaborative-autoethnography process Moving Towards Values-Driven Development At the time of the programmes initiation in  programme leaders were driven by a need to develop a postgraduate level degree that would successfully diversify the Information Schools taught programmes offer and attract new students to the School it sort of started out probably just we just had to create something we were quite successful as a department we attracted students who didnt want to do that Computer Science type of course thats the sort of target that we were looking at what we called then the type two data scientist The programme developers were bound by tight constraints in terms of staffing and the creation of new modules we werent given free reign we couldnt create loads of new modules so theres practical constraints as well I think we were allowed to create three or four new modules We acknowledged how these conditions shaped the initial design of the programme recognising that the drivers constraints and the techno-scientific backgrounds of those involved meant understandably that curriculum concerns initially emphasised practical skill development rather than more social concerns Thinking about the social aspects wouldnt have been my first worry my first worry would have been the actual practical output so what skills can we provide students with Perhaps unsurprisingly given the heavy marketisation of UK Higher Education in recent years beyond the need to define and teach core Data Science skills the main drivers of the programmes early development were largely financial and market-led Primarily the programme design aimed to attract students and their fees in a subject area that was reported by industry to have a skills shortage and was constrained by the amount of institutional investment provided for staffing and module development We reflected how since  the programme had undergone a fairly fast transformation with Critical Data Studies perspectives being embedded in the core of the programme as new people joined the team As a previous programme leader pointed out I dont think at the outset we probably thought about it as were thinking about it now and particularly having Jos input thats how things have I think evolved kind of over time This shifting perspective represents not only changes in the people involved and the content taught but also the opening of a space for fostering values-driven curriculum design Despite differing levels of experience and confidence all programme team members were keen to engage with a values-driven approach to teaching Data Science that emphasised concerns around FATE and CDS We also observed that our engagement with a values-driven approach extended beyond the integration of FATE/CDS into the broader culture of the team including our reflections on pedagogical issues internationalisation and a shared commitment to work together across disciplinary boundaries despite the various communicative and philosophical barriers we surfaced While the Data and Society module has been core to the programme since  a previous programme leader reflected on how topics relating to FATE and CDS had been integrated into the programme design I think one of the comments in the provocations document that resonated with me was maybe the social sciences being a bit of a bolt on and it was never really intended to be that but I do wonder whether thats possibly how it did start out And as we kind of evolved over time I think you know a classic example of this is that  you gave I think one lecture on the introduction to data science which was data and society and over time that evolved then to be a whole module to then evolve to you now being a deputy programme coordinator where you can shape the programme Team members had different perspectives on the extent to which FATE/CDS topics were currently integrated into the curriculum While some perceived a deepening integration one new team member observed I mean I got the impression from the outside that a lot of our modules are technical and then we basically expect  to deal with the social part in the Data and Society module all laugh Despite this observation there was evidence that elements of FATE were slowly emerging in one or two practical modules One module leader reported being more mindful every year I started just last year to introduce little elements of you know be mindful of how you use the data and give little example of misuse and what is not appropriate In my teaching I introduce various examples that illustrate the need for transparency Others however were less confident In relation to my Database Design module I struggle to understand how these concepts FATE are related Hence theres a huge gap in knowledge Despite significant changes in recent years some weaknesses were perceived in our current approach to integrating FATE/CDS into the programme design and assessment Perhaps we are missing an element which is putting those Data and Society concepts ideas debates arguments into practice in relation to different technical skills that are being learnt To what degree are those aspects the sort of social science aspects covered in the coursework Because the students theyre very coursework driven Is it only Jos coursework that really explores that The rest of us are getting them to crunch numbers produce visualisations and so on Do we get them for example to create a visualisation thinking about the social aspects the effect that they might have Probably not and thats fine so therefore maybe its our failing not the students that we havent got their attention by getting it embedded in the coursework Our reflections around these challenges were inspired by the idea of a third space discussed by Klaassen in the provocations Advocates argue that learning is triggered in the third-spaces at the boundaries of disciplines cultures and social groups This concept resonated strongly and in different ways for team members As our discussions evolved our emergent understanding was that while our current programme design did under certain conditions have the capacity to generate a third space there was more we could do to design a curriculum and modes of assessment that actively fostered the development of a third space thus enhancing students and academics capacity to be fluent in FATE/CDS driven Data Science Various practical suggestions for a programme level approach to FATE/CDS that would activate such a third-space were explored For example rather than conceptualising the curriculum as a series of complementary modules the team saw potential for better FATE/CDS integration and attainment of the programme learning outcomes by merging core modules into one coherent and integrated block taught and assessed by the Data Science teammembers The team will explore these ideas further in the coming months alongside the various administrative and assessment related challenges that we identified such approaches would undoubtedly raise including how to ensure an adapted programme design still meets the requirements of our existing or a replacement external accreditation body What do we want While at the surface level there was a clear commitment to the deeper integration of FATE/CDS into the Data Science degree as our discussions evolved we began to become more aware of the complexities and challenges about what this may mean in practice Two key issues emerged What do we mean by FATE/CDS Do we have a shared and coherent understanding What is the meaning of FATE/CDS in an international classroom and in the context of decolonising the curriculum and maintaining academic freedom These definitional issues were recognised as a challenge when collaborating at the intersection of disciplines What we mean by these concepts as well all the constructs are debated people disagree about what they mean You could spend your entire academic career just trying to define what justice is for example and I think that adds an extra layer of complexity probably not just in terms of the relationship between us and the students but also probably within the team as well We all have a different understanding about what all of these different concepts mean Im not even sure I know what some of these concepts mean for myself In our discussions about the struggles of working in a multidisciplinary context it was expressed by many team members that they struggled with the philosophical nature of SSH approaches that underpin many of these conceptual debates and which contrasted with the often unexplored philosophical norms of disciplines they were more familiar with Coming from Data/Computer Science into the Social Sciences/Humanities field I always found it strange the importance maybe fixation with the research setting and all of the different fields and frameworks present Working in Data/Computer Science the positivist research philosophy seems invisible in its ordinariness There was also a feeling that philosophical flexibility ought to go both ways So I see a bit of asymmetry So the direction is only it seems only one way so the other way would be okay Im a social scientist and I want maybe to do something that can be more reproductive or viable so the integration from lets say technical So if we have an idea of justice or fairness how can we put it in a technical way This philosophical framing and uncertainty about different theoretical approaches and concepts tended to dominate cross-disciplinary perspectives and some expressed a strong emotional reaction to encountering SSH approaches for the first time It was a shock in the beginning and it still partly is The first encounter was traumatic Similarly from the Social Science perspective one team member spoke of becoming disillusioned with Stats at undergraduate level Many of us reported having dismissive attitudes towards other approaches at some point but over time shifting perspective often as a result of working in collaboration with others Despite most of us emphasising philosophical differences as a key challenge some team members observed that on reflection many of the issues at stake were political rather than strictly philosophical in nature I started to notice more the political ideologies embedded in self-professed completely impartial hard science work I am more careful in trying to understand the underlying ideological assumptions that are often embedded in computational work and I try to expose the ideology driving my research questions before diving in into them Its not just a philosophical issue its a political ideology issue and I think we need to sort of stay mindful of that that its not just being awkward about philosophy but that theres a reason for that thats political in nature that people would want to cling onto a certain way of thinking about a concept This emphasis on the political nature of FATE/CDS is currently reflected in the Data and Society module with its emphasis on power and agency as well as philosophical and ethical concerns However there was limited time in this project for capturing a deeper understanding of our diverse perspectives on the power dynamics and politics surrounding how we define concepts such as FATE/CDS and some things were for now left unexplored This is evident in a brief aside in a discussion about the potential for external accreditation of any new FATE/CDS oriented developments we implemented Speaker Does Microsoft do anything because I know they got their new centre for FATE Fairness Accountability Transparency and Ethics I dont know if they do anything you know or Google for example someone like that I know they have whole teams now and centres set up where they do some kind of Speaker Well would it be better that we become the authority that puts stars on to the people The meaning we give to FATE/CDS as a programme team and the politics of who is given the authority to define meaning and shape practice are crucial For our team this remains a key issue to explore as we deepen the integration of FATE/CDS into the Data Science curriculum A similar concern arose in relation to our role as educators within international classrooms As seen in Table the majority of students in  registered on our Data Science programme are international ie not UK or EU While there is some diversity in nationality among international students the vast majority are Chinese How to address issues around FATE/CDS in this context including in relation to broader efforts to decolonise the curriculum arose on a number of occasions in our discussions it is very Western so these concepts of ethics fairness accountability transparency a lot of them are very liberal concepts particularly fairness accountability and transparency Id say I mean data justice so we would already be biased in there because we would look at it from a UK European perspective Now someone from another country a different culture might have a different perspective Now you might say Well okay but its a British degree but then a counter argument to that would be Well this is colonialism youre putting on your world view teaching your world view Yeah but can you possibly be objective I mean this is our culture so we teach what we know best and they decided to come here to learn what we can teach so we cannot accommodate for everyone I mean I think we should stick but we should have a broader understanding of where they are coming from in order to understand how far they need to come I think this could be what the third space is talking about its just saying just discussing about you know in my culture this is not a concept but this is not even applicable from where I come from so having that space and kind of protected space where there is more of a collaborative feeling where you know everyone can share what they feel like is going to be quite interesting Through consideration of being mindful of the different cultural assumptions we and our students might be bringing to the classroom we also recognised that by deepening FATE/CDS integration we would likely introduce more potentially contentious topics into the classroom Our discussions highlighted the need to be more confident of our own boundaries about what was acceptable Speaker Would there ever come a point where you would actually put your foot down and say No thats unacceptable what someone was saying because it just jarred so much with your beliefs Just say if someone says something particularly sexist or racist and they genuinely meant it how does that work out Speaker I think there comes a point where people are stepping over a line you know where what theyre actually doing is sort of like inciting hate or something which is illegal Yeah I think there are boundaries I think they need to be very sensitively handled within the classroom context But yeah I think generally the idea is to open up to discussion not to enforce an agenda I can have my views but Im never going to say to a student You need to think like me  thatd be authoritarian But yeah so I think we do need to reflect on that and make it clear because it would destroy the teaching environment as well if students perceived that they had to think in a particular way or they had to think in a particular way in order to pass the assessment While some members of the team had some experience of addressing somewhat contentious topics in their teaching including with students who may face repercussions in their home country for voicing particular opinions others expressed worry about their confidence in being able to handle such issues Youre dealing continually with tricky situations and Ive suddenly got cold feet thinking oh dear have I got the skills to facilitate a discussion that allows me to know what the boundaries are and things I probably will be ok Its all about confidence isnt it and Ive been teaching for a very long time and I still find it a bit scary This is clearly an important concern if the team were to deepen the integration of FATE/CDS across the curriculum Team members initially considered whether one way to mitigate such issues might be to limit the topics we allow students to work on or avoid particular topics in classroom materials However on reflection we acknowledged this would be a form of self-censorship and raised concerns in relation to academic freedom While we were not able to fully resolve the concern there was a sense that we would likely need to have an approach that would enable free and open discussion on contentious issues so long as its not illegal and its not outside the university allowed policy ie in relation to Dignity at Work Equality Diversity and Harassment What do the students want Through our discussions we slowly moved towards a vision of how we might integrate more FATE/CDS topics into our Data Science curriculum however uncertainties were raised about what students want from a Data Science degree Given the time constraints and sensitivity of discussions we were not able to engage students in this study however we plan to do so in follow up work While the societal aspect of the current degree design does attract some particularly UK students to the programme and the Data and Society module receives positive feedback from many students many also have a tendency to perceive technical modules to be more relevant to their programme I mean this is one of the issues on the Data and Society module is that it gets good marks for everything apart from the one that it comes out a bit weaker on tends to be seeing the relevance of the module to the programme Further discussions with students and student evaluations revealed a potential difference in perception between home and international students understanding of the programme I think we have the problem that I think our marketing is important for the home students in that they do understand the difference in the Masters that we cover societal aspects but I dont think its all that obvious for international students I think a lot of times its potentially because they are coming here with the expectation of gaining technical skills when they see the name Data Science it immediately captures their technical kind of interest I think theres also quite a number of students who possibly dont choose us on the grounds of content So I think the idea would be that they choose the course because they want that Social Science perspective on Data Science but I do think actually its probably not quite that It might be that now were listed in the top whatever universities were a well-known School Data Science is kind of what we want to do thats what they want to do which could be where this mismatching kind of oh it isnt quite what I expected because they kind of didnt really look at the marketing This challenge is clearly a significant issue In the context of the UKs heavily marketized Higher Education sector the survival of the programme is dependent upon the continued recruitment of students and as educators we would chose to teach students that are engaged with our approach to Data Science and have chosen to study with us on that basis This means that further FATE/CDS integration will require a careful balancing act of developing new marketing materials aimed at attracting students potentially in new markets who favour our approach while maintaining recruitment to the programme at close to current levels Nonetheless despite the challenge there was some optimism that such an approach could work I could imagine that being quite successful because its in the news all the time these issues and people are picking up on it and were saying Well thats what this degrees about It would really knit things together well Fostering our capacity A further challenge raised was our own capacity to deepen the integration of FATE/CDS across the Data Science curriculum Capacity issues were raised in relation to our existing workloads which were stretched due to a rise in student numbers and our current areas of expertise and confidence in delivering effective teaching and assessment in this area All team members highlighted knowledge gaps on topics relevant to FATE/CDS including in areas such as theoretical frameworks in which to consider the topic such as notions of fairness and bias I feel ill-equipped around legal issues within the area often I have problems in following some arguments because I dont have the philosophical background that is often taken for granted in some papers the theoretical ontological context of research and how to integrate that intomy teaching of fundamental statistics putting those FATE/CDS concepts ideas debates arguments into practice in relation to different technical skills that are being learnt I dont feel that Ive got the skills to be able to do that how these issues can be integrated into the day-today life of a data scientist is also where I feel I have a gap how can you put these issues and theories into practice and operation within businesses As individuals we clearly felt we had significant gaps in the knowledge required to deliver a state-of-the-art FATE/CDS orientated Data Science curriculum However upon reflection it became clearer that collectively we have a lot of knowledge and experience to share within the team It was agreed that although support and accreditation from external organisations with relevant expertise might be valuable we could also to a great extent help ourselves A variety of practical suggestions to empower team members to share knowledge were proposed including sessions reading materials auditing modules across the programme discussion sessions on contentious topics simulating the classroom environment and targeted seminars on communicating across disciplines some of which we will be exploring this academic year Core to any developments in this domain will be to ensure that these knowledge sharing spaces we produce will foster learning it needs to be a space where you feel secure its an informal space where you dont feel embarrassed to say I dont know please can you help me learn that so its quite interesting how you create that space and make it a space where people are willing to kind of you know learn and share and so on Looking further in to the future recruitment of new staff members was also recognised as important While the programme team was perceived to be somewhat diverse in gender and nationality it was acknowledged that if we want to go all the way through with it being unbiased and so on we need to actually find the right candidates from all populations which could be a challenge as well DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Through engaging in this research project we confirmed our commitment to FATE/CDS integration in principle and recognised the insights we had gained teaching FATE/CDS as a core part of the curriculum since  However deeper reflection raised questions about the meaning and application of FATE/CDS concepts and the practicalities and politics of how to integrate them We noted that our current approach towards integrating FATE/CDS into the curriculum was situated somewhere between a multi- and interdisciplinary approach with FATE/CDS teaching and assessment largely albeit not entirely siloed in the Data and Society module We observed that relevant topics were beginning to filter into some more practical modules and some dissertation projects and that strong students were able to build their own links creating a third space between modules Nonetheless we agreed that a fully interdisciplinary approach would require a much deeper integration of FATE/CDS into the curriculum potentially through combining all core learning and assessment into a single unified module Extending this logic further we recognised that a transdisciplinary approach would further require increased engagement with non-academic knowledge and that this may need to extend beyond our current industry links if the programme is to deepen its FATE/CDS ethos Overall our programme appears to have a relatively advanced and well-resourced approach to FATE/CDS integration compared with other programmes reported in the literature eg Further we work well together as a multi-disciplinary team communication is open and respectful there is an appreciation for one anothers knowledge and insights and we envisage this should make for a solid foundation for discussion around more contentious topics around the politics of FATE/CDS that will need to be addressed if we decide to further integrate the degree While there were instances of cross-disciplinary unfamiliarity there was little evidence of the team being greatly hampered by the related cognitive difficulties that pervade constrain and even block collaborative interdisciplinary work described by MacLeod p Nonetheless we identified clear limits to our current level of integration and challenges and potential barriers to further integration Despite various calls in the literature for FATE/CDS integration into Data Science Curricula there has so far been little examination of these practical and political challenges of enabling this to happen Through our reflections and group discussions we observed that the challenge of FATE/CDS integration is not only a question of what and how we should teach and how we as educators gain that knowledge but how this can be achieved in practice within the complex socio-material conditions our work takes place within For example the challenges of working in a highly marketized higher education sector mean that not only do changes that may impact student recruitment hold significant risks but that as academics we are also working in highly pressurised environments with little time for personal study to address gaps in understanding and re-thinking existing teaching materials and assessments Further values-driven curriculum development raises a series of complex challenges in a programme that attracts students who may have very different cultural values and assumptions to the academics teaching the course How this is handled sensitively and mindfully with regard to decolonisation efforts is still to be fully explored This suggests that alongside the numerous calls formore FATE/CDS to be embedded into the curriculum the community also needs to work together to address the practical challenges of implementing this in practice Failure to address these practicalities may lead to a situation where Data Science programmes become FATE-washed That is they have a veneer of FATE but fail to equip students with the desire and ability to embed their critical insights into their future data practice With this in mind we conclude by making a number of suggestions Creating learning spaces Our discussions illuminated the need for Data Science teams to work collaboratively across sub-disciplines to share knowledge and insights that would help teammembers to deepen the high-quality integration of FATE/CDS across teaching and assessment It is important to recognise that everyone does not need to be an expert in all areas of the curriculum however team members can support one another to deepen collective understanding and synthesise insights The importance of such space being informal and supportive creating an environment in which colleagues can acknowledge they dont understand something is crucial As is ensuring learning is accessible in relation to already heavy workloads and recognising the need for learning in all directions social technical Such space could also be extended beyond individual academic institutions to foster the development of online and offline cross-disciplinary learning spaces in the wider community The politics of FATE Our discussions began to surface differences beyond the philosophical assumptions of disciplines that are emphasised in the literature on interdisciplinarity that were more political in nature Such differences began to emerge in discussions around who gets to define best practice in FATE and are likely to surface again as discussions around integration unfold This mirrors wider discussions beginning to take place in the FATE/CDS community for example in relation to the decision to embed a program on Critiquing and Re-thinking Accountability Fairness and Transparency CRAFT in the FAT Conference and Taylor and Purtovas recent paper Acknowledging and understanding this political dimension to FATE/CDS integration will be important for Data Science degree teams such as ours that aim to deepen integration of FATE/CDS into the curriculum As a community we can help teams better understand these issues through the sharing of short accessible and engaging materials that illuminate the power dynamics at play in such efforts and which can be used in reading and discussion groups Collaborate across borders In advancing an agenda around FATE/CDS integration in Data Science we need to deepen our understanding of the cultural shaping of FATE discourse and work with international students and collaborators and experts in curriculum decolonisation efforts to address these issues In our teams case this particularly means enhancing our understanding of Chinese perspectives on issues of ethics and social justice Existing networks and organisations such as the iSchools Consortium and ACM FAT may be well placed to help foster such collaboration The image of Data Science Many prospective students and many curriculum designers perceive Data Science solely as a technical discipline with good earning potential Deeper integration of FATE/CDS into Data Science curricula could be hindered due to student resistance and reluctance to engage with the non-technical parts of programmes We need to think about how Data Scientists might move away from this image towards a more socio-technical identity that positions ethical and political considerations at the core of Data Science Data Science competency frameworks There are increasing mentions of FATE relevant topics in published competency frameworks however there is still a need to consider FATE/CDS related competencies at a deeper level Without creating too many restrictions on teaching practice and innovation what should a well-designed FATE/CDS-driven Data Science curricula address What should curriculum designers be thinking about and what should students understand and be able to do at the end of their studies How might educators go about teaching key and emerging topics Existing networks and academic fields such as ACM FAT ACM Data Science Task force iSchools Consortia as well as some non-academic partners could be well positioned to collaborate on articulating such competencies and encouraging the development of open learning resources While the challenges identified in our research relating to deepening FATE/CDS integration in Data Science curricula are significant and our possible responses to them are constrained by the socio-material contexts we find ourselves embedded within they are not wholly insurmountable Our struggles to overcome these challenges should also help us remain mindful of the challenges that FATE/CDS-aware Data Science graduates are likely to face as they enter their own workplaces Enhancing Data Science students critical and ethical thinking is clearly not a cure-all unethical and socially irresponsible data practice will continue as long as it goes rewarded and poorly regulated However with these caveats in mind we conclude by arguing that in order to foster the development and spread of more socially aware and responsible data practice it remains important to work together to overcome these challenges and empower the development of interdisciplinary teams that can integrate and deliver high quality FATE/CDS teaching in Data Science curricula
