A Semiotics-based epistemic tool to reason about ethical issues in digital technology design and development One of the important challenges regarding the development of morally responsible and ethically qualified digital technologies is how to support designers and developers in producing those technologies especially when conceptualizing their vision of what the technology will be how it will benefit users and avoid doing harm However traditional software design and development life cycles do not explicitly support the reflection upon either ethical or moral issues In this paper we look at how a number of ethical issues may be dealt with during digital technology design and development to prevent damage and improve technological fairness accountability and transparency Starting from mature work on semiotic theory and methods in human-computer interaction we propose to extend the core artifact used in semiotic engineering of human-centered technology design so as to directly address moral responsibility and ethical issues The resulting extension is an epistemic tool that is an instrument to create and elaborate on this specific kind of knowledge The paper describes the tool illustrates how it is to be used and discusses its promises and limitations against the background of related work It also includes proposed empirical studies accompanied by briefly described methodological challenges and considerations that deserve our attention CONCEPTS Human-centered computing HCI theory concepts and models Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence KEYWORDS semiotic engineering ethics epistemic tool INTRODUCTION Supporting responsible technology design and development from beginning to end of the technology life cycle is a challenge especially in the early stages when technologists are conceptualizing their vision of what the technology will be how it will benefit users and other stakeholders and avoid doing harm However traditional software development life cycles do not explicitly support the reflection upon either ethical or moral issues They involve users and other stakeholders mostly as information sources when eliciting requirements or evaluating the software By contrast agile approaches involve the customer throughout the process but their priority to satisfy the customer and their preference to the shorter timescale encourage such a quick pace and narrow view of customer needs versus broader societal impact that they may discourage more thoughtful design In human-computer interaction HCI design the reflection upon ethical issues is usually considered very important but it is not instrumented nor systematically supported We need an approach that supports the reflection upon ethical and moral issues throughout the design and development process by customers target users designers and other stakeholders and experts who may have a say in the potential impact of the software in question Our goal is not to propose a specific process but an epistemic tool to support development teams in reflecting upon these issues as they follow their preferred development process In his paper on artificial intelligence AI and moral responsibility Coeckelbergh proposes that a change in perspective from an agent-centered to a relational agent-patient one has the potential to advance new kinds of solutions to AI justification and explainability His line of argument is that people who use technologies or are somehow affected by such use the patients in the relation are entitled to ask questions about technologies and get answers from their creators and owners Coeckelbergh refers to this as answerability underlining the importance of thinking about moral responsibility questions and answers throughout the development process and not only as an a posteriori kind of analysis We respond to Coeckelberghs call to dialogue by presenting the initial results of our work on using Semiotic Engineering to support epistemic reasoning on ethical and moral issues related to the design of digital technologies in general and AI in particular Semiotic Engineering is originally a semiotic theory of HCI which has been extended to investigate how human meanings are inscribed in software in design and development stages As most other semiotic theories and approaches devoted to studying computers and computation Semiotic Engineering frames computation as a form of computer-mediated extensively but not exclusively automated social communication through natural and artificial languages which not only expresses human technical rationality and design intent with respect to a wide variety of purposes and domains but also carries the conscious or unconscious values beliefs and expectations of those who are expressing themselves and those to whom communication is directed As a quick example of what this perspective means let us take the case of likes in social networks Presumably when they first appeared on screen the designers and developers of the technology meant to provide users with a quick and easy way to demonstrate their appreciation to other peoples online content to strengthen or create social connections and emotional ties This may also have been the immediate perception of users back then who engaged in the proposed conversation with and through social network interfaces and thus began to manifest their likes accordingly From a semiotic point of view it is noteworthy that the designers of technology proposed a binary sign as the only element for this particular interface segment You could either like the content typically by clicking on thumb up or heart icons or not If you did not like it what could you be saying by that That you really disliked the content that you would rather refrain from manifesting your opinion that you would like to postpone your manifestation till you had the time to think about it Or could the absence of a like simply mean that you were not aware of the content Studies on how the binary semiotic system proposed by social network platform designers was appropriated and evolved address the emotional commercial political and maybe even the civilizatory impacts of overloading meanings and placing a narrow-band expressive system at the disposal of people who would probably have so much more to say than liked it see for example The easiest computation on binary signs is of course to count them Therefore the quantity of likes have begun to be interpreted used and manipulated to mean a wide range of different things whose distinction from one another and corresponding validation is humanly impossible to verify Semiotic Engineering theory and methods have been created to investigate the processes of computer-mediated social communication between technology producers and consumers which naturally aligns to Coeckelberghs agent-patient relational perspective It has been used and evolved over more than two decades and now turns to urgent societal needs framed as a call for more fairness accountability and transparency Our contribution is to help technology producers in reasoning about ethics and moral responsibility in relation with the users ie the technology consumers At the current stage we have conceptualized and analyzed the consistency and cohesion of an epistemic tool which we will test empirically only after having exposed it to wider consideration critical analysis and debate Given the complexity the multidisciplinarity and the benefit of discussions that can take place prior to delving into empirical studies using the tool we focus on the theoretical foundations and rationale of our tools design This choice does not prevent us however from concluding the paper with suggested empirical studies accompanied by briefly described methodological challenges and considerations that we already know will deserve our attention This paper is structured as follows The next section section presents the foundations background an rationale for our work Section presents the guiding questions and process we propose to follow in order to build an extended metacommunication template taking into account ethical considerations from a conceptual framework of the designers choosing Section illustrates how the extended metacommunication template can be built using the guiding questions we designed and section discusses the epistemic nature of the tool describing the main reflections the designer has engaged in when building the example metacommunication template Prior to conclusion section positions our contribution in view of existing research Finally section closes our paper with some final considerations and directions for future work FOUNDATIONS BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE In this section we briefly introduce the key points of the foundational theory for our research Semiotic Engineering subsection and comment on background work that like Coeckelberghs has provided us with insights on either the problem we want to address or the solution we propose subsection We wrap up the section with a description of the rationale behind the new epistemic tool subsection Foundations in Semiotic Engineering This subsection presents only a few core concepts in Semiotic Engineering to help readers understand and evaluate our proposal We have selected them from prior publications with unabridged presentations of the theory As already mentioned Semiotic Engineering views HCI as a particular case of computer-mediated social communication Its original contribution to the field is to define a specific object of investigation to create new methods to investigate it and finally to propose a set of foundational concepts to orient long-term research in HCI and related areas This is in clear contrast with the most popular perspective in HCI user centered design UCD whose origins can be largely traced back to Normans cognitive engineering model of HCI In it interaction is characterized by a set of seven iterative actions all carried out by the users hence the user-centeredness establishing a goal forming an immediate intention specifying the action sequence executing the action perceiving the system state interpreting the system state and evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and intentions Note that no other agent but the user is active in Normans model Following the alternative computer-mediated social communication perspective Semiotic Engineering characterizes HCI as a twofold metacommunication process involving software developers and software users At the top level developers send to users a one-shot complete message telling them through the systems interface and supported interactions how where when what for and why the users can communicate back with the system The latter kind of communication is achieved at the lower level through user-system interactions The entire process is analogous to playwrights top-level communication of their global message through lower-level communications among the characters in their play The analogy is useful to underline the interplay of mutual beliefs expectations intentions and other subjective aspects of developers-users relations not typically explored in HCI theories Moreover because of the interactive medium provided by computer artifacts software developers have a proxy that virtually speaks for them at interaction time namely their systems user interface As users interact with the developers proxy they truly achieve computer-mediated social communication Metacommunication is thus communication about and through other levels of communication The content of the metacommunication top-level message sent by systems developers to systems users is represented abstractly in the metacommunication template which says Here is my understanding of who you are what Ive learned you want or need to do in which preferred ways and why This is the system that I have therefore designed for you and this is the way you can or should use it in order to fulfill a range of purposes that fall within this vision p To illustrate how this is achieved take the user interface of a fictitious search engine Haystack Figure a Just like in natural interpersonal communication speakers and listeners assume the presence of mutual communication goals Therefore as speakers developers use a blinking cursor to communicate to users that they are waiting for users to tell them/their proxy the terms for the search As listeners users may take the blinking cursor and the empty text box to mean that it is their the users turn to communicate their intent textually The example also points at the automated dimension of social communication the underlying computer processes that interpret and generate conversational turns and their corresponding effects on both front-end and back-end system states Haystack Find a Haystack Find b Figure Haystacks a search interface and b response for an attempt to search for an image through drag-and-drop Mutual and frequently unconscious beliefs between computer-mediated communication participants can be convergent as in the example just mentioned or divergent Divergent mutual beliefs typically give rise to breakdowns or discovery For example a user may wonder whether Haystack can search for images by taking an image as search term An easy way to communicate this question interactively is to drag an image and drop it onto the search area and watch what happens In Figure b we show the developers proxys response to the users communication expressed as a drag-and-drop interaction The conversation between the developers proxy and the user which unfolds over a short period of time can be loosely verbalized as the following dialog User Can you search for images like this one Drags the file icon onto the search term area Developers Proxy This cannot be done Shows the forbidden sign next to the cursor Closer to the topic of this paper notice that easy-to-understand communicative exchanges in both examples are different from very complex metacommunication that may actually never be achieved not even partially for most users about why certain items have a higher ranking than others when retrieved by Haystack Would it make a difference if Haystack developers told users through efficient metacommunication even if superficially why certain items show first Or why other items may never show What may saying nothing about ranking imply or be taken to mean Could this be a problem When and why According to Semiotic Engineering the developers choice about whether and how to communicate ranking principles information to users at interaction time is the result of their understanding of who their users are what they have learned the users want or need to do in which preferred ways and why Moreover to communicate efficiently and effectively their message developers must have technical knowledge and abilities that allow them to increase the chances of successful communication Therefore maximal communicability is achieved with metacommunication that efficiently and effectively expresses a systems underlying design intent and construction implementation principles In other words it clearly tells users the way they can or should use the system in order to fulfill a range of purposes that fall within the developers vision of themselves their product their products users etc By explicitly engaging designers and developers in introspective analyses Semiotic Engineering tools have a great practical potential to promote ethical and socially responsible reasoning during software development Suppose that Haystack has a shopping section and that designers and developers view their users as shoppers navigating in the aisles of a shopping mall This might favor a map-like representation of the shopping space as a mall which users can navigate at leisure However if Haystack offers users a list of shopping options instead the mere switch of metaphors greatly influences what shoppers are most likely to buy or not buy Team members introspective reflection upon their own images and notions regarding shoppers might enable a series of questions about whom they are communicating with in which capacity on whose behalf and to what end possibly raising ethical issues Background Work The st century has seen the increase and intensification of societal and scholarly debate about moral responsibility and ethics with respect to AI Voices from inside and outside the Information and Communication Technology ICT community have manifested their concerns For example among ICT experts Nissenbaum is one of the pioneering figures in discussions about human values and computing in general and Johnson a pioneer in Computer Ethics for pre-AI ethics and morality related discussions in ICT see Recent insiders research broadly concerned with ethics in software development include for example Karim et al discussing a code of ethics for software development Al-Fedaghi interested in how software engineers should think about ethics Shilton and Anderson looking at ethics in technology design activities and Scott and Barlowe calling the attention to computer education As AI enters the stage the debate has been engaging ICT insiders and outsiders alike Philosophers in particular have been especially active as is also the case with many jurists concerned with personal data protection To illustrate the kinds of philosophical debate focusing or touching on AI we can mention research on the ethics of decision making based on algorithms and data carried out by authors associated with the Oxford Internet Institute eg Further work includes the already mentioned work by Coeckelbergh on a relational justification of AI explainability The author has also discussed ethics with health care systems and assistive technologies and robots Researchers who have previously published in the ACM Conference series on Fairness Accountability and Transparency with an emphasis on philosophical perspectives include Binns who proposes a political philosophy perspective to approach machine fairness and Bietti who discusses the trivialization of ethics and moral philosophy now understood as a kind of ethics washing carried out by big tech industries and analyzes the origin and consequences of such misunderstanding Work about legal aspects in turn have been gaining greater attention in view of personal data protection regulations in many countries For example Wachter et al and Doshi-Velez et al examine the right to explanation in view of the EU General Data Protection Regulation Other topics of attention include how the law should approach self-driving cars eg and the use of AI and robotics in health systems eg a broad interdisciplinary study about ethical legal and social implications of using AI in breast cancer care and in-depth discussions about the notion of causation in AI and in Law AI has of course stirred up many insiders concerned with interpretability and explainability eg and more generally with fairness accountability and transparency eg As a background for our research we should specifically mention existing work proposing technical artifacts to address ethical concerns and precautions for the developers of digital technologies Among these are those artifacts meant to register technologists concerns about how data sets or machine learning models are used by people who havent created them originally A noteworthy example is the family of cards like model cards data sheets and metaphorical nutrition labels to inform users about the ingredients of machine learning data sets A special example in the context of this paper is the call to action regarding how knowledge gained from philosophical discussions on moral responsibility and ethics in current technologies translate into software engineering practices As will be seen in subsequent sections we have used Morley et als attempt to close the gap between principles and practices The authors respond to Floridi and Cowlss proposal of five ethical principles which in their view synthesize and unify all previous proposals of ethical guidance in the age of AI They conclude that the four principles of bioethics plus that of explainability offer sufficient top-level orientation for ethical decisions From top-level orientation to practical software design and decisions there is however a long distance to travel Hence Morley et als call to action Rationale for the New Epistemic Tool in Semiotic Engineering In the previous subsections we presented the gist of our work in Semiotic Engineering subsection and the background work that has guided and inspired the kind of contribution that we want to make with our research subsection In this final subsection we present the rationale behind our proposal Ethics and moral responsibility are relational matters Therefore judgment about both requires that one be able to view himself or herself in relation to others The core concept of metacommunication in Semiotic Engineering establishes a strong st person nd person relation between technology producer and technology consumer Therefore working with the Semiotic Engineering metacommunication template page technology designers and developers are stimulated to psychologically connect with people who are going to use their product and can reason about how the interactions supported by what users can see and do convey their message to users express their intentions and design goals manifest their beliefs and expectations regarding the users including the users own beliefs and expectations promote productive and safe user-system exchanges and so on and so forth Another important aspect of Semiotic Engineering regarding ethical and moral reasoning during design and development stages of digital technology is that its tools for metacommunication design evaluation and investigation are all eminently epistemic In their book about epistemic fluency and its critical role in contemporary professional activities Markauskaite and Goodyear remark that knowledge is produced in a multitude of places and that it flows rapidly across organizational disciplinary and national boundaries p Professionals must be equipped to perform constant epistemic activity as they move knowledge from place to place and build new knowledge structures to take along as they travel across rapidly changing contexts In their words The dynamics of professional work situations are such that professionals have not only to work with knowledge and use knowledge to justify their action they also need to be adept at practices of creating and testing new applicable knowledge In this sense professional cultures are taking on more of the qualities and practices of epistemic cultures p Here is my understanding of who you are what Ive learned you want or need to do in which preferred ways and why Analysis This is the system that I have therefore designed for you Design and this is the way you can or should use it Prototype in order to fulfill a range of purposes that fall within this vision Evaluation Figure Alignment of metacommunication template and design lifecycle stages In agreement with Markauskaite and Goodyear Semiotic Engineering tools are conceived to support situated knowledge construction and organization which by the same token supports the expansion of professionals or researchers expert knowledge about computer-mediated metacommunication involving digital technology producers and users This epistemic perspective reveals a Socratic inclination in our belief that Semiotic Engineering can support ethical reasoning Regardless of whether they start from a set of explicit ethical principles and good practices a key point in our elaboration is that by seeking to know more about themselves their users the context and situation before and after technology is introduced the impact of change the risks of disruption and so on designers and developers will continually approach morally acceptable and socially responsible behavior In order to operationalize an epistemic tool we extended our metacommunication template with ethical and moral responsibility content By being prompted to fill out the extended version of the template we believe that software designers and developers will be confronted with concrete questions they should answer when organizing the meaning and the form of their computer-mediated message to the end users If such extension per se passes the test of analytical examination which we initiate with this paper and empirical validation which we will carry out only once the analytical examination is satisfactorily concluded our future steps will be to use Semiotic Engineering methods specifically designed to investigate the emission and reception of meanings inscribed in software to verify the solidity and in situ applicability of our proposal The promise in this case is to benefit from mature theoretical foundations and methodology that could represent a significant step forward in bringing ethics and moral responsibility reasoning into the culture of software development EXTENDED METACOMMUNICATION TEMPLATE Most HCI design and development lifecycles present similar versions of the following stages analysis understanding user needs and defining requirements conceptual design prototyping and implementation and evaluation All models recognize the iterative nature of the design and development process so that every stage can be revisited as necessary The Semiotic Engineering metacommunication template can be segmented according to those stages In Figure we show the correspondence between the metacommunication template segments and a general lifecycle model The numbers above the stages match the numbers used in the next sections We have extended the Semiotic Engineerings metacommunication template by adding a list of explicit guiding questions designers should ask at each step of the design and development lifecycle The next subsection presents the guiding questions and how we propose to use them Guiding Questions The guiding questions can be classified into base questions and ethical questions The base questions are variations of questions considered in usual design lifecycles with the distinction that within semiotic engineering the designer adopts a st-person I my perspective when asking and answering them addressing the user as the nd person you your in the conversation By contrast the ethical questions focus on explicitly addressing ethical issues and can be supported by diverse ethical frameworks and principles for instance the biomedical ethics principles of beneficence nonmaleficence autonomy and justice To visually distinguish the ethical questions they are preceded with an asterisk All questions are numbered so they can be referenced in the usage example presented in the next section The design process is iterative but we tend to answer the base questions somewhat sequentially revisiting them when addressing the ethical questions in the same stage as illustrated in Figure any stage base questions ethical questions chosen ethical principles beneficence nonmaleficence autonomy justice Figure Schema of base and ethical questions in each stage assigned with the chosen ethical principles Analysis understanding needs and defining requirements What do I know or dont know about all of you and how What do I know or dont know about affected others and how What do I know or dont know about the intended and other anticipated contexts of use For everything I realize I do not know I should ask whether I should know it and if so how I can learn it What ethical questions can be raised by what I have learned Why Design What have I designed for you Which of your goals have I designed the system to support In what situations/contexts do I intend/accept you will use the system to achieve each goal Why How should you use the system to achieve each goal according to my design For what purposes do I not want you to use the system What ethical principles influenced my design decisions How is the system I designed for you aligned with those ethical considerations Prototyping implementation and formative evaluation How have I built the system to support my design vision What have I built into the system to prevent undesirable uses and consequences What have I built into the system to help identify and remedy unanticipated negative effects What ethical scenarios have I used to evaluate the system Continuous post-deployment evaluation and monitoring How much of my vision is reflected in the systems actual use What unanticipated uses have been made By whom Why What anticipated and unanticipated effects have resulted from its use Whom do they affect Why What ethical issues need to be handled through system redesign redevelopment policy or even decommissioning All questions keep with the st-person perspective proposed by the original Semiotic Engineering template They also create an explicit and direct relation between st me us and nd persons you through the product being created by the st person singular in the expression above but typically plural in team development practices The design stage is where most questions occur perhaps reflecting the inheritance of Semiotic Engineerings original focus on design Getting from we to I Software development involves a team of designers developers professionals from multiple disciplines and other stakeholders who may have a say in the design or who may be influenced by the deployment and use of the system They may bring diverging forces to the design process in such a way that the outcome may be an incohesive product This issue is related to the problem of many hands an expression coined by Thompson in the context of public officials and goverment policies to define situations when many people contribute in many ways to policy decisions so it is difficult to identify who is morally responsible for the outcomes To reduce the negative effects of this distributed view of what the product should be we propose to have them negotiate meanings to achieve a collective vision of the product and how it should be used later converging into a cohesive st-person vision To assist in this negotiation we propose that each one of those interested parties should write their version of the metacommunication message guided by the questions presented in the previous subsection This would give us the different perspectives expectations and visions for the product each member of the group holds The plain natural language in which the metacommunication message is written makes it easier for people to engage in sense making meaning negotiation and consensus building as the wide adoption of scenarios in design processes attest Our goal is to move from a distributed we to a collective we and finally to a st person I in the design vision for the product as illustrated in Figure By converging into a st-person vision we aim to avoid the dilution or distortion of responsibility found in the hierarchical and collective models investigated by Thompson distributed we collective we I final Figure From distributed we to collective we to I in design TOWARD THE METACOMMUNICATION MESSAGE ANSWERING THE GUIDING QUESTIONS To illustrate the creation of the metacommunication message using the proposed guiding questions we have selected as an example a mobile app for the gig economy The direct users of the mobile app are service contractors and service providers We next describe the final metacommunication message considering the service contractor as the interlocutor you indexed by the guiding questions Each fragment that answers a base question may be followed by one or more ethical questions or issues in italics When appropriate we identify the ethical principles that led us to think about each issue but not necessarily the only principle that is applicable to the issue at hand In the example we used the ethical principles of biomedical ethics which we represent using the following notation B for beneficence for non-maleficence A for autonomy and for justice What do I know or dont know about all of you and how About you I know that i You are an actual or potential service contractor who wants good-quality service ii You accept having small problems or inconveniences a few times but not if it becomes a trend What if you misrepresent small inconveniences as poor service A iii Where you are when you ask for a service What if accepting to render you a service puts the provider at risk eg dangerous locations But I dont know i Your profile age gender race religion ii How experienced you are with technology What if you hire the wrong service by accident A iii Whether you may be prejudiced against a group of people who may end up serving you What if I inadvertently put you in harms way eg by exposing a black person to a racist person iv How much feedback you would be willing to provide about your service provider What if you cannot express yourself as needed eg to denounce gross misbehavior A What if you misrepresent your opinion because of mistaken assumptions about what the evaluation may mean to the service providers What do I know or dont know about affected others and how About the service providers families I know i They may depend on the service providers salary which in turn depends on the providers working hours and on the demand for their services But I dont know i Their role in helping or hampering the service provider to do their job About the company owner I know i They want to maximize their profit What if they exploit the service contractors or providers ii They have an influence on my design What if they ask me to design something that harms others to make them more money A But I dont know i How emotionally and financially invested they are in the business About the company analyst I know i They want data to analyze What if they rely on insufficient or unreliable data B What if this reduces service contractors or service providers privacy But I dont know i How independent they are in their functions What if their actions are influenced by someone who does not have your best interests at heart ii What they have been ordered to do with the data What if they are ordered to do something harmful to you with the data collected by our system About the citizens I know i They do not want their lives to be disrupted by the service being provided eg excessive accumulation of delivery bikes near where they live increasing traffic What if negative disruptions are unavoidable Do the benefits outweigh the harms But I dont know i How else the service may affect them What if something I have overlooked affects them negatively What do I know or dont know about the intended and other anticipated contexts of use I know i intended You will only use our system when you want a service provided to you What if you cannot control when and how you receive notifications A What if the company wants to know where you are and what you are doing all the time B ii anticipated When a service provider misbehaves in your view you may try to avoid them in the future What if you block someone or post a complaint in our system for no justifiable reason But I dont know i What motivates you to hire a service What if you want to do harm to service providers through our system ii How regularly you will hire services What if I nudge you to hire a service I suspect you do not really need A iii When you would like to provide feedback on a service you hired What if I force you to provide feedback at an inconvenient time A What have I designed for you A mobile app available in various app stores through which you can hire services from various providers Which of your goals have I designed the system to support I have designed the system so you will be able to i Find and hire services You may easily find the services you seek B What if providers outside of our platform experience decreasing demand and lose their businesses ii Check your service providers information You may verify that the provider is who they say they are through their photo B iii Track the execution of these services You may verify whether the process is being correctly executed provide feedback or even cancel it if not A B iv Track the route the service provider will take to the service location You may check where the provider is and plan accordingly B You may not influence the route that our algorithm recommends to the provider A What if the route that our algorithm recommends to the provider is suboptimal or even dangerous v Pay for these services through the platform using a pre-registered credit card What if you want to pay for the service outside of the platform A vi Provide feedback about the service You may help our system to ensure the service quality B What if your feedback negatively affects the providers livelihood You will be able to skip giving feedback A What if the company considers this as an indication of poor-quality service In what situations/contexts do I intend/accept you will use the system to achieve each goal Why I intend you to use the system i Whenever you need to hire a service Your request will be processed and if possible directed to a provider B What if the request is directed to a provider who is unavailable so you will have to wait The provider will be able to fulfill their role B You will only see the options provided by our recommender system without knowing how it works A Our surge pricing algorithm may give you different prices for the services at different times ii In the place where the provider will render the service You will be there to talk to the provider while they render the service to make adjustments and avoid misunderstandings A B I accept that you may use the system i In a different place from where the service will be rendered What if the provider has questions about the service and which you are not there to answer A How should you use the system to achieve each goal according to my design You should i Use the search bar to look for the services you may want to hire Our recommender system may prioritize some options over others based on what it knows about you B A What if our recommender system fails to choose good service options for you You will not fully understand how our recommender system works A ii Register your credit card before hiring a service so that we can charge it when the service is provided It facilitates the payment B It ensures that the provider will be paid B It gives you some control as to how to pay for the service A iii Rate the service after it is rendered to ensure its quality It allows us to ensure the overall service quality B The provider cannot rate you in the same way What if our system harms the providers income by sending fewer requests to those who receive lower ratings What if our system considers your lack of rating as an indication that the service was poorly rendered A For what purposes do I not want you to use the system You may not use my system to i Keep requesting and canceling until you find a service provider who is more convenient to you It places an undue burden on our company A It wastes the providers time and may harm them eg causing them to lose other services It would influence our surge pricing algorithm and inflate prices for all other contractors How have I built the system to support my design vision I have built the system i As a mobile app so that you will able to hire services wherever you are ii With a search tool so that you can find the services you want to hire Our recommender algorithm will tailor the search results for you B What if our recommender system limits your options for hiring services on behalf of others eg by prioritizing services near your location A iii With a map so you can track the providers location as they move towards the place where the service will be provided What if you use this information to locate and intercept the service provider for nefarious reasons In these cases the provider will have to report you through the complaint tool afterwards A You cannot influence the route the provider takes even if you know it is suboptimal or dangerous A iv With a third-party payment service so that you dont need to worry how you will pay for the service when you hire it What if the third-party service misuses your information violating your privacy You have accepted the terms and conditions of our system thus accepting this kind of risk A v With a rating system that you can use to evaluate the service provider to help us decide whether or not they get any future service requests What if you use this tool to discriminate bully and harm them assuming that these ratings have an effect on the providers livelihood What have I built into the system to prevent undesirable uses and consequences I have built into the system i A requirement that you have a valid email and phone number to create an account so that I can be sure that I can reach you If you lose access to your account you can use your email or phone number to regain it B ii A requirement that you have a valid credit card registered so that you cannot avoid paying for services rendered To prevent fraud when you register the card we make a small charge to verify it is valid B I have not built into the system i A way to check for systematic bias in ratings What if the rating system is abused ii A way to check whether or not you have received emails from our system What if you miss information that is relevant to you What have I built into the system to help identify and remedy unanticipated negative effects I have built into the system i A section where you can complain about the services rendered and possibly even get a refund What if the complaints may have an impact on the providers livelihood What if the service providers falsely claim they have provided the service You will need to provide evidence that they have not and the company will refund you and punish them How much of my vision is reflected in the systems actual use My design vision has been reflected in i How little effort it takes for you to create an account to start using our system ii How you have been able to easily find and hire the services you need Our recommender system has reduced the time you need to spend searching for the services you desire B Is it possible that it is not fair to all providers iii How the service can reliably charge you for the services that have been provided My design vision has not been reflected in i How you have not always rated the quality of the service provided What if the company considers this lack of rating as an indication that the provider has done a poor job ii How much difficulty the company has in handling complaints What if the company cannot process the complaints in a timely fashion to prevent future harmful outcomes What unanticipated uses have been made By whom Why I have not anticipated i That you would use the ratings and complaints to discriminate against the service providers What if you harm the providers livelihood by doing this ii That you would repeatedly check the prices of services to try and find when you would be able get the smallest price What if our surge pricing algorithm causes you to waste your time checking prices What anticipated and unanticipated effects have resulted from its use Whom do they affect Why I have anticipated that i You would end up relying more on hiring services through our system than through other means What if this disproportionately harms services that are not in our system Does this coerce them into joining the platform A I have not anticipated that i You would end up paying inflated prices because the providers might engage in price fixing I did not foresee that providers would collude to fix prices harming you I may be able to redesign our system to detect these cases and stop them by punishing those involved ii You would not be able to find certain services due to the recommender system I do not fully understand how the algorithm I used chooses which services to recommend to you so I cannot assure you that it is fair DISCUSSING THE DESIGNERS EPISTEMIC JOURNEY This section discusses some aspects regarding the epistemic nature of the tool narrating the main reflections we as designers have engaged in when building the example metacommunication template including the challenges of finding the right expressions to convey our meanings subsection our commitment to adopting a st-person perspective in design subsection and the nonlinear nature of our reflection subsection Note that due to the epistemic nature of the tool different designers could have generated a different narrative and engaged in different reflections Expressing Design Intent in Natural Language When answering the guiding questions and creating the metacommunication message we endeavored to find the right words and structure to express ourselves so that the reader would be able to gain an understanding of our design intent vision and rationale This process led us to various interesting insights about our own way of thinking about our design Choosing the right expression required us to face our own subjective perspective on what was being built Instead of aiming at solving a problem objectively we had to acknowledge the subjective meanings that we inherently ascribe to our own creation Critically comparing what the artifact meant to us to how those meanings were actually expressed revealed ways in which our design did not match our intentions Writing down our design decisions in natural language instructed by the guiding questions helped us uncover presuppositions behind them The questions prompted us to reflect upon diverse design alternatives and the arguments in favor or against each one so we could justify our design decisions By engaging in this reflection we could identify ways in which our reasoning was flawed or insufficient By directly challenging our assumptions the questions also provoked us to reflect on what we believed we knew Working critically we gained insights not only about our understanding of the problem but also about ourselves and our culture If we as designers made choices that we could not reasonably justify we would be assuming the risks that these gaps in knowledge create If we proceeded anyway we would do so knowingly and this would be telling about how we dealt with this design problem Of course our proposal requires that we honestly represent our intentions throughout the design process Framing was key here We often felt tempted to highlight our positive intentions when creating the artifact but the act of making our rationale explicit facilitated our own recognition of the negative aspects of our actions assumptions and decisions Painting an excessively rosy picture of our design intent would become apparent in the text forcing us as writers to face equivocations that we might be trying to avoid Another interesting consequence of writing down our design intent in natural language is that what we do not write says as much about our design and ourselves as what we do Leaving out crucial information could be perceived as carelessness or even a deliberate attempt to hide something By requiring that we expressed our decisions and rationale through writing it became easier to find conceptual gaps and inconsistencies either they accidental or deliberate Having identified these cases we could revisit our thinking behind these decisions gaining insights on the problem on our design process and on ourselves Commitment to a First-person Perspective Once we understand how explicitly writing down our intent makes us face our own decisions we may seek to hide behind other entities Attributing actions to the system for example without acknowledging our major role as its creators might allow us to deflect some of the blame for any negative consequences that arise from its use In that way the system becomes the agent and we fade into the background Detecting these cases was important since they gave us insights about our mindset and our own uncertainties when creating the artifact This was an important advantage of having the guiding questions frame us as st-person creators of the artifact Having had to acknowledge our role as designers and explicitly state our presuppositions and decisions we recognized ourselves as the true agents behind the systems actions Being a reactive thing the computational artifact can only react to the users interaction according to the rules we encode in it Framing this as a relation between us as designers I and the end user you mediated by the artifact we create we became central figures in moral situations having to face our decisions and their consequences Not only our agency but also our agent-patient relation with our users as discussed by Coeckelbergh became explicit It was not always easy to maintain this framing however As we were experiencing the process of building the metacommunication message by answering the guiding questions we often caught ourselves relying on the image of the system to take our place This revealed itself to be an interesting phenomenon as we then reflected on when and why we instinctively tried to distance ourselves from whatever we were working on Often we would find that we were unsure about what we were writing down be it the decisions or the underlying assumptions This was especially the case when identifying potentially negative consequences and ethical issues that our artifact could create By maintaining the st-person perspective and noticing when we instinctively tried to avoid it we came face-to-face with the underlying ethical questions of our relationship with the end user and other stakeholders By recognizing our role as agents in this relationship we acknowledged our moral responsibility Consequently we were encouraged to reflect deeper on our intentions behind our design ensuring that we were acting morally and thoughtfully of the consequences of the software use Non-linear Reflection At each stage of writing the metacommunication message we were asked to identify the ethical issues that our design choices might raise By revisiting each of our answers to the guiding questions we were prompted to analyze the meanings of the words we used to describe our intent This process led us to identify ethical issues not only with our choices in relation to each question but also with previous statements made in other parts of the metacommunication message as well For example when analyzing an ethical issue within the design part we were able to see that the issue was not directly caused by design decisions but actually by some of the presuppositions behind them generated in the analysis In this way insights gathered in one part of the metacommunication message led us to revisit and revise concepts expressed in other parts Since our ethical reflection concerns the artifact as a whole and each part of our design intent is related to every other this is to be expected Looking at our statements for each of the guiding questions we could identify issues in both the ethical and design domains since our analysis connects the two When we looked at a certain ethical issue we could recognize when it resulted from a flaw in our design process from missing a certain key piece of information from misidentifying user goals and needs Correcting these faults can in turn generate new ethical issues and so it goes on iteratively RELATEDWORK Part of the work related to our research formed the background against which we characterized the focus of our proposal see subsection In this section we complement the background against which we position our contribution We start with previous work that has explicitly used the st person of discourse to support ethical reasoning or questions A recent example is the Consequence Scanning guide proposed by Brown It poses two st-person questions for developers to answer What are the positive consequences we want to focus on and What are the consequences we want to mitigate The main difference compared to our work is the absence of an explicit nd person you the users which creates a conspicuous and engaging me-you relationship Older approaches to supporting computer professionals decisions about ethics have also posed st-person ethical questions but have not engaged professionals in an explicit me-you relation Such is the case of OBoyles decision-making process questions which refer to users and stakeholders as another person eg Does my action or inaction diminish another person by deceiving that person or rendering him/her less trusting or less secure Heuristics-oriented approaches early reviewed by Maner and their successors which now tend to concentrate on more or less unified ethical guidelines for the AI or the ICT industry in general eg vary in emphasis Some concentrate more on the principles others on the process of integrating them into existing practices with software industry An important initiative to operationalize ethical assessment among computer professionals is Harris et als work with DIODE a meta-methodology for the ethical assessment of new technologies DIODE is the product of collaborative efforts by researchers government agents and commercial professionals presenting a comprehensive set of tools like flowcharts and templates for practical use The meta-methodology is carried out in five stages definitions issues options decisions and explanations The main difference between DIODE and our work is that DIODE is clearly process-oriented whereas our work privileges epistemic activity Rather than making sure that all steps of a methodology are followed we are hoping to make sure that anyone using our approach even if partially learns continually about themselves others and the world we live in We should also mention that work on value-sensitive design and software engineering is related to ours even though values and ethics are different things The important link is that we share with this perspective an integrative view of new AI challenges against the backdrop of persisting HCI and Software Engineering human-centered issues for any computer technology not just AI Ethical challenges are added to the existing list and should not be treated as an aside We finally acknowledge initiatives to use statements and descriptions of data and model features to express ethical concerns or precautions that ML experts identify with respect to the technology they contribute to build The common contrast between these and our work is the focus on the internal technical aspects of ML datasets training algorithms and models rather than on the external contextualized use situations illustrated in section The explicit answers to the guiding questions and the extended metacommunication template we propose may complement and serve as resources for building their models CONCLUDING REMARKS We conclude this paper with a brief discussion of its promises and limitations We also include a list of empirical studies accompanied by briefly described methodological challenges and considerations that deserve our attention Some of the items in this list are part of our own immediate future work In our view the promise of this work lies in its epistemic nature We mentioned that Markauskaite and Goodyear underline how critical the ability to generate actionable knowledge constantly and fluently is for st-century workers By integrating ethical considerations into a larger framework of computer-mediated interpersonal extensively but not exclusively automated communication where computer interfaces speak for whoever has built them our epistemic tool has the potential to avoid the risks of turning ethical evaluation into a bureaucratic process Filling out the metacommunication template as we have learned over the years is anything but a bureaucratic task And even when it is not done in its entirety the parts achieved already have a beneficial effect Moreover since the kind of knowledge gained explicitly refers to the knowledge agent personally because of its radical st-person perspective the memorability of learned lessons is likely to increase The main limitation of our proposal at this initial stage is the lack of empirical indications about the plausibility of its promises Additionally standing fully as a conceptual object it lacks the practical adjustments and corrections typically imposed by findings of empirical studies in situ Yet as we have repeatedly mentioned above the proposed tool is a complex one whose conception is deeply anchored in existing knowledge from Semiotics and HCI Therefore as a complex object per se our epistemic tool is open to productive discussion and critique even in such conceptual state As an example of the advantages of maturing our understanding of the tool prior to engaging into empirical studies we can mention that the epistemic nature of the tool strongly suggests that predictive research designs are not likely to work Knowledge constructed with an epistemic tool can grow at any time in virtually any direction Thus the kind of research approach we use must be carefully examined Likewise a separation of ethical from non-ethical knowledge built with the metacommunication template may be difficult to achieve Since ethical dimensions are integrated in the overall computer-mediated social communication in which systems designers and developers are engaged we are not sure that such separation is possible or needed Interesting future work with our tool includes case studies with professional developers trying to understand the epistemic impact of using the extended template Empirical studies can also be carried out in educational settings using the extended template as a learning resource par excellence In a different direction an important kind of research is to investigate the separability of ethical principles and paradigms For example if we want to use virtue ethics or a utilitarian ethics instead of bioethics principles would we be able to use the extended template questions as currently defined instantiating them to those paradigms Or would we need to adapt the ethical questions themselves Similarly given the acknowledged Socratic inclination of our proposal the illustration of our approach with the use of a priori principles borrowed from bioethics following Floridi and Cowls suggests an avenue of investigation about converging or diverging evolution of the results of ethical introspections triggered by this tool vis à vis organizational codes of ethics that may be in place This will however require time and carefully designed longitudinal studies
