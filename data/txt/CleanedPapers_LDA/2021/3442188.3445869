Biases in Generative Art A Causal Look from the Lens of Art History With rapid progress in artificial intelligence AI popularity of generative art has grown substantially From creating paintings to generating novel art styles AI based generative art has showcased a variety of applications However there has been little focus concerning the ethical impacts of AI based generative art In this work we investigate biases in the generative art AI pipeline right from those that can originate due to improper problem formulation to those related to algorithm design Viewing from the lens of art history we discuss the socio-cultural impacts of these biases Leveraging causal models we highlight how current methods fall short in modeling the process of art creation and thus contribute to various types of biases We illustrate the same through case studies in particular those related to style transfer To the best of our knowledge this is the first extensive analysis that investigates biases in the generative art AI pipeline from the perspective of art history We hope our work sparks interdisciplinary discussions related to accountability of generative art CONCEPTS Social and professional topics Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence KEYWORDS generative art style transfer biases AI socio-cultural impacts INTRODUCTION Generative art refers to art that in part or in whole has been created by the use of an autonomous system In a broad sense the term autonomous can refer to any non-human system that can determine features of an art work such as use of smart materials mechanical processes and chemical processes to name a few Computer generated art ie art generated by algorithms or computer programs is perhaps the most common form of generative art In fact the terms generative art and computer art have been used more or less interchangeably for a long time now With the rapid advancement of deep learning there has been remarkable progress in AI based generative art From creating hybrid images using attributes from multiple images to generating cartoons from portraits AI based generative art has exemplified new and diverse applications As a consequence AI based generative art has become extremely popular In Sotheby auction house sold an AI generated art work for pounds A little earlier in the auction house Christies sold an AI generated art work for a staggering USD Institutions have also shown an increased interest towards AI based generative art as evidenced by the number of museum shows There are also several apps and tools such as that have not only enhanced the popularity of AI based generative art but have also facilitated ease of use and accessibility to end-users Figure Example of bias in AIportraits app Skin color of actress Tessa Thompson left is lightened in the apps portrait rendition right thus exhibiting racial bias Image source Amidst this progress and popularity surge experts across disciplines have voiced concerns regarding the consequences of generative art For example in the authors reflect on the impact of interfacing with art autonomously generated by non-human creative agents The authors argue that such art could widen the divide between the human creator and the human audience and emphasize on the need to balance between automation and development of humans creative potentials Discussing whether computers can replace human artists the author in argues that art requires human intent inspiration a desire to express something The author further adds that artistic creation is primarily a social act and concludes that computers cannot replace humans In a similar vein discussing whether machines can create art the author in argues that the process of creating an art work is distinct from the outcome ie the artwork Drawing from the theory of philosophical aesthetics the author states that when something is created something about inner self is expressed It has been argued that both art and technology are means through which humans reveal their epistemic knowledge Such knowledge could include societal values cultures beliefs as well as individual biases and prejudices In the work artist and computer scientist Aaron Hertzman states artworks are created by a human-defined procedure and further notes that computer Figure Example of bias in learning artists styles The affect conveyed by the original image a is lost in the Van Gogh version b of This is contrary to Van Goghs style see c a real artwork by Van Gogh depicting red flowers in the field like in a generated art can thus be biased Even artists like David Young who argue that machines create art on their own acknowledge existential bias in generative art In the essay Tabula Rasa Young notes that human biases in the form of preconceptions irrationalities and emotions can easily get embedded into the data used to train these generative art AI models A recent notable example of bias in generative art concerns a portrait generator app called AIportraits It was pointed out that skin color of people of color was lightened in the apps portrait rendition Figure provides an illustration of the same Furthermore AI algorithms are best thought of as data-fitting procedures As the author in beautifully describes these algorithms are like tourists in a foreign country that can repeat and combine phrases from the phrasebook but not truly understand the foreign language or culture Many types of latent biases in generative art especially those concerning art history have not been analyzed in any of the past studies Further socio-cultural impacts of biases in generative art have not been investigated We aim to address these issues in this work We motivate the problem with an illustration Consider an image-to-image translation model such as CycleGAN which has been used to create images across different artists styles Figure b shows an example of Van Gogh version of a photograph Figure a as rendered by the CycleGAN model As can be seen the affect conveyed by the original image is lost in the Van Gogh version the red flowers perhaps indicative of Spring are no longer evident instead a dry season is reflected The generated image seems quite contrary to Van Goghs take on colors Green Ears of Wheat an art work by Van Gogh serves as an illustration to the point see Figure c As documented in his letters to his sister Wilhelmina and artist Horace M Livens Van Gogh mentions about how he emphasized colors and how by using bright contrasting colors he was able to infuse life in his works Poppies or red geraniums in vigorously green leaves motif in red and green These are fundamentals which one may subdivide further and elaborate but quite enough to show you without the help of a picture that there are colours which cause each other to shine brilliantly which form a couple which complete each other like man and woman Thus by merely using correlation statistics to model the artists style aspects such as emotion and intent which are central to an arts creation are not taken into account thereby rendering a biased representation of the artists style and also possibly stereotyping the artist in the process Such biases could potentially have long standing adverse sociocultural impacts First because of the inherent biases in training data and algorithms generative art could be embedded with racial bias gender bias and other types of discrimination Second based on their limited understanding algorithms could stereotype artists style and not reflect their true cognitive abilities This means aspects such as artists intent and emotions are overlooked thus potentially conveying an opposite affect in the generated art Third historical events and people may be depicted in a manner contrary to the original times thus contributing to a bias in understanding history and thereby get in the way of authentically preserving cultural heritage illustrated in Sec These observations therefore compel an analysis of generative art so as to uncover various types of biases Contributions In this paper we investigate biases in AI based generative art right from those that can originate due to inappropriate problem formulation to those that can be related to algorithm design Viewing from the lens of art history we discuss the social-cultural impacts of these biases We advocate for the use of causal models to depict potential processes of art creation We highlight how current methods can fall short in modeling the process and thus contribute to various biases such as selection bias and transportability bias We illustrate the same through case studies that span various art movements artists art media/material genres and geographies First examples of biases that arise due to improper problem formulation namely framing effect biases are considered Sec After providing a background of causal models Sec we discuss case studies to demonstrate confounding biases in modeling artists styles Sec followed by illustrations of selection bias Sec Biases in transferring artists styles also known as transportability biases are discussed Sec Transportability bias is demonstrated by considering case studies that include both art movements that are subtly different eg modern art movements such as Cubism and Futurism and art movements across different time periods eg Modern art and Early Renaissance Illustrations of biases in datasets are provided in Sec A list of the case studies examined in the paper can be found in Table Our findings shed light on the various inherent biases in generative art right from problem formulation and datasets to algorithm design and data analysis We also discuss the socio-cultural repercussions of these biases Sec To the best of our knowledge this is the first extensive analysis that investigates biases in the generative art AI pipeline from the perspective of art history We hope our work triggers interdisciplinary discussions concerning accountability of generative art and sparks the design of novel methods to address these issues Case study selection We surveyed academic papers online platforms and apps that generate art using AI In order to uncover potential biases from an art historical perspective from the surveyed list we selected papers and platforms that focused on simulating established art movements and/or artists styles Thus papers such as or platforms such as which focus on deviating from established styles to create imaginary patterns are not included in our study To demonstrate various biases we have considered state-of-the-art generative art AI models and platforms/apps such as that focus on simulating established art movements and artists styles The art movements considered as part of case studies have been determined Model Bias type Art Movements Artists Genres Confounding bias Post-Impressionism Vincent Van Gogh Landscape Selection bias Romanticism Gustave Dore Illustration Selection bias racial bias Renaissance Various artists Portraits Transportability bias Post-Impressionism Paul Cezanne Photo Landscape Transportability bias Cubism Futurism Fernand Leger Gino Severini Genre art battle painting Transportability bias Realism Expressionism Mary Cassatt Ernst Kirchner Portraits Transportability bias Renaissance Expressionism Clementine Hunter Portrait Sculpture racial bias Folkart Desiderio da Settignano Transportability gender bias Renaissance Raphael Piero di Cosimo Portraits Representational bias Renaissance Various artists Portraits Label bias Ukiyo-e Various artists Various genres Table Summary of Case Studies described in the paper Note there could be more than one type of bias associated with each For illustrative purposes only one bias type is discussed in each Model denotes the algorithm/platform listed under corresponding references based on the experimental set-ups reported in these state-of-the-art AI models and platforms These include Renaissance art Modern art Cubism Futurism Impressionism Expressionism Post Impressionism and Romanticism and Ukiyo-e art It is to be noted that due to the paucity of existing AI applications that study non-western art forms Ukiyo-e is the only non-western art form studied The genres span landscapes portraits battle paintings genre art sketches and illustrations Art material considered includes woodblock prints engravings paint etc The study includes artists across cultures such as Black folk artist Clementine Hunter American painter Mary Cassatt Dutch artist Van Gogh French illustrator and sculptor Gustave Dore Italian artist Gino Severini amongst others In the next section we discuss work related to computer generated art AI FOR ART GENERATION Computer generated art has a long history In s painter Harold Cohen began exhibiting paintings generated by a program called AARON By s several artists were using computer programs to create interactive experiences for the audience In the s Flash a tool for creating animations became popular Around the same time Paul Haeberli introduced a paint program whereby a user could quickly create a painting without needing any technical skill In s tools like Processing and OpenFrameworks allowed artists to make art using code As early as researchers in computer vision were training computers to learn artists styles from examples Since rapid advancement in deep learning has triggered a wide range of models for AI based generative art For example is an open source tool released by Google that uses a convolutional neural network CNN to understand what neural networks are doing at each layer by creating dream-like appearances Another CNN architecture is the neural style transfer work that allows to blend content of one image into style of another image to create new images In a recurrent neural network is proposed to construct stroke-based drawings of common objects Recently generative adversarial networks GANs have become popular for creating art Creative adversarial networks proposed modifications to the GAN objective to make it creative by maximizing deviation from established styles and minimizing deviation from art distribution In the authors proposed a method to translate styles across unpaired images and illustrated its applicability in transferring artists styles In the authors used conditional GANs to generate artworks There are many tools and apps to facilitate users to easily create art Using users can transform a portrait in the style of famous portraits Photos can be converted into artworks using In an application called GANbreeder two images are combined to generate a new image The style of the input image is transformed into another specified style in Cartoonify turns a photo into a cartoon drawing leveraging Googles Draw This Given that there are many tools to quickly create art there is an increased risk for generative art to be biased With surging art market and pressing need for diversity and inclusiveness in art an analysis of bias in generative art becomes even more pertinent In a recent art project titled Imagenet Roulette AI researcher Kate Crawford and artist Trevor Paglen exposed biases in machine learning datasets While there have been studies to understand how humans perceive art and to examine if there is a perception bias towards art created by AI there is little to no extensive analysis concerning biases in generative art In this paper we provide an extensive analysis of biases in art generated autonomously by AI looking from the perspective of art history Such an analysis is useful to understand machine related biases independent of human biases and is necessary to study scenarios involving both human artist and machine bias In the rest of this paper generative art refers to AI based generative art ART-HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF ARTWORKS In this section we discuss various aspects pertaining to art history based on which art works can be analyzed Art historians employ a number of ways to group world arts into systems of classification These groupings are based on a set of qualities that are significant Such significant qualities could be related to specific approach of an artist material used to create art works art movements genre etc We provide a brief account of some main aspects so as to aid in understanding some types of biases that we illustrate in the paper Art Movements Art movements can be described as tendencies or styles in art with a specific common philosophy influenced by various factors such as cultures geographies political-dynastical markers etc and followed by a group of artists during a specific period of time Examples of art movements include Ancient Egyptian art Ancient Greek art Medieval Art Renaissance art Modern art etc Within each of these art movements there are sub-categories based on various factors For example modern art includes many subcategories such as Symbolism Impressionism Post-impressionism Cubism Futurism Pop-art and so on As an illustration consider Impressionism and Post-impressionism Both movements originated in France however Post-impressionism originated in reaction to Impressionism While Impressionism was characterized by vibrant colors spontaneous brush strokes and urban life styles Post-Impressionism artists had their own individual styles to symbolically display real subjects and their emotions Similarly each art movement is characterized by unique features that reflects certain trends Thus art movement is a dominant factor influencing artists and artworks Interested readers may refer to where over hundred sub-categories are listed across a dozen art movements Art material Artworks can also be grouped based on the material and techniques used in creating the art Charcoal enamel mosaics tapestry paint and lithography are some examples of art materials Artists use different techniques to create artworks from different materials For example mosaic is a coherent pattern or image in which each component element is built up from small regular or irregular pieces of substances such as stone glass or ceramic held in place by plaster/mortar entirely or predominantly covering a plane or curved surface even a three dimensional shape and normally integrated with its architectural context Mosaics were traditionally used as decoration for floors and walls becoming very popular across the Ancient Roman World Different art movements saw the prevalence of different materials For example during the Renaissance period sculptures were made out of various materials like marble white stone gold etc Thus material and technique employed to create art can influence the artist and the resulting artwork An elaborate list of various materials can be found in the WikiArt dataset Genre Genre of an artwork is based on the depicted themes and objects A hierarchy of genres was developed in the century According to this hierarchy history paintings namely paintings depicting scenes of important historical mythological and religious events were considered to be the top ranked genre and this was so until the mid century History paintings were usually large and typically narrated a story such as a battle allegory or the like Portraiture was another prominent genre and these usually depicted royals aristocrats and other important people in society Portraiture had to convey aesthetic aspects of the subject depicted such as their power beauty etc In contrast genre painting depicted scenes from every day lives of ordinary people Landscapes animal painting and still life painting are some other prominent genres Abstract or figurative art are the most common genres for contemporary art An artist usually can work across different genre types however art historians mark certain artists as representatives of a particular genre For example Anthony van Dyck is recognized as a portraitist Alfred Sisley as a landscape painter and Piet Mondrian as an abstract artist though each one of them worked in a number of different genres Wikiart dataset provides an extensive list of genres based on artists and artworks Artists There are many aspects that characterize an artists style In addition to factors such as art movement art material and genre an artists style can be characterized by factors such as their cultural backgrounds their art lineage or schools from whom they learned or who influenced them and other subjective aspects such as their cognitive skills beliefs prejudices and so on Consider for example Paul Cezanne one of the most popular artists in the history of modern art Although generally categorized as a Post-Impressionist artist Cezanne influenced several other art movements such as Cubism and Fauvism Some of his early pictures depict classical and romantic themes with expressive brushwork and dark colors while later he is said to have adopted brighter colors drawing inspiration emotions and memory to paint Cezanne himself remarked A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art In his still-life paintings Cezanne began to address technical problems of form and color by experimenting with subtly gradated tonal variations or constructive brushstrokes to create dimension in the objects His artworks span a variety of genres and exhibit patterns from multiple art movements marked by subtle cognitive aspects Thus modeling artists style is not a straightforward computational task it entails many abstract elements that are hard to quantify Yet researchers define style in ways that suit their models performance we discuss this issue next BIASES DUE TO PROBLEM FORMULATION Biases can arise based on how a problem is defined and is formally known as the framing effect bias Consider for example the problem of style transfer in artworks There are at least two different notions of styles when it comes to artworks one which is related to the art movement and another which is related to the artist As described in Section there are many aspects to each of the above notions of style Yet researchers conveniently define style in a manner that suits their models performance This is a consistent problem across several models For example in the authors claim that their model learns Ukiyo-e style since the generated images are yellowish like Ukiyo-e artworks In a single model is used to learn styles of artists and art movements Like in the justification to have learned Ukiyo-e style seems to be based on color features Thus style has been defined based on the color of the generated art Given that most Ukiyo-e works were woodblock prints it is thus natural for the generated art to be yellowish Ukiyo-e is a form of Japanese art The works usually depicted landscapes tales from history scenes from the Kabuki theatre and other aspects of everyday city life Some unique characteristics of Ukiyo-e included exaggerated foreshortening asymmetry of design areas of flat unshaded colour and imaginative cropping of figures Foreshortening refers to the technique of depicting an object or human body in a picture so as to produce an illusion of projection or extension in space and to convey the notion of depth These characteristics are not captured in the examples depicted in Such drawbacks can also happen due to the model design issues which we discuss in Section Nevertheless inappropriate problem formulation can introduce and perpetuate biases across the generative art AI pipeline In the next section we briefly describe structural causal models that we leverage to analyze different biases STRUCTURAL CAUSAL MODELS We advocate for the use of causal directed acyclic graphs DAGs to analyze some types of biases that are related to algorithm design and datasets In Section we saw that there are several aspects relevant to an artwork and that these aspects could influence each other in many ways For example art movement could influence the choice of art material the subject of a portrait could influence the artist and so on DAGs help in visualizing such relationships DAGs also allow encoding of assumptions about data model and analysis and serve as a tool to test for various biases under such assumptions Researchers have leveraged causal models to discuss and develop various notions of fairness Causal models facilitate domain experts such as art historians to encode their assumptions and hence serve as accessible data visualization and analysis tools Based on different expert opinions there can be multiple assumptions Thus there can be more than one DAG describing the relationship of an artwork with the artist genre art movement etc Thus using multiple DAGs it is possible to analyze for biases under different scenarios We discuss basic concepts related to causal models and through case studies illustrate the intuition behind using causal models to analyze biases in generative art DAGs are visual graphs for encoding causal assumptions between the variables of interest Specifically the assumptions about data are encoded by means of structural causal models SCMs A structural causal model consists of two sets of variables and and a set of functions that determine or simulate how values are assigned to each variable The variables are observed and variables are unobserved variables and constitute the vertices of a causal graph and the directed edges between them denote the various causal dependencies d-separation Regardless of the functional form of the equations in the model conditional independence relations can be obtained if the model satisfies certain criteria separation is a criterion for deciding from a given a causal graph whether a set of variables is independent of another set given a third set The idea is to associate dependence with connectedness ie the existence of a connecting path and independence with unconnected-ness or separation Path here refers to any consecutive sequence of edges disregarding their direction Consider a three vertex graph consisting of vertices and There are three basic types of relations using which any pattern of arrows in a DAG can be analyzed these are depicted in Figure The leftmost graph i denotes a causal chain or that of a mediation The effect of on is mediated through In this case given ie conditioning on is independent of or is said to block Figure D-separation Graph structures to illustrate conditional independence Please refer to Section for details the path from to In the center graph ii is a common cause of and If unobserved is a confounder as it causes spurious correlations between and Conditioned on the path from to is blocked In the rightmost graph iii is a collider as two arrows enter into it As such the path from to is blocked However conditioning on the path will be unblocked In general a set is admissible or sufficient for estimating the causal effect of on if the following two conditions hold No element of is a descendant of The elements of block all backdoor paths from to ie all paths that end with an arrow pointing to Interventions An intervention on a graph is denoted by the operator The operator corresponds to setting the intervened variable to a specific value and removing the influence of other variables on it For example in graph ii of Figure implies that the variable is set to the value and the incoming arrow into is removed operator facilitates quantification of causal effects For example in Figure ii the expression quantifies the causal effect of on A set of rules referred to as do-calculus are always applicable in the context of interventions These rules determine when it is possible to to add/delete observations in interventions to exchange interventions and observations to add/delete interventions do-calculus helps in rendering expressions free from do We are now equipped to discuss algorithmic biases in generative art BIASES RELATED TO ALGORITHM Bias can arise if the algorithm ignores the effect of unobserved variables overlooks domain specific differences uses subsets of the population for analysis and so on We discuss these in this section Confounding bias Confounding bias originates from common causes that affect both inputs and outputs We illustrate this bias through case studies Case Study Modeling artists styles has been one of the most common applications in generative art As discussed in Section several observed and unobserved abstract aspects constitute an artists style Revisiting example discussed in Figure the problem of modeling Van Goghs style can be viewed as estimating the causal effect of Van Gogh on the artwork Thus the expression Artwork do Artist models the style of the artist in the artwork Section It is to be noted that the assumptions encoded through a DAG can vary from one expert opinion to another However these varying opinions help to discover and test for biases under different scenarios and in turn highlight the drawbacks of existing correlation based methods such as that do not take into account important cultural and social aspects that influence an artists style Consider Figure i that depicts one potential process of art creation note there could be several others based on assumptions of domain experts we consider one such for illustration Here the variable denotes the artist denotes the artwork is the genre is the art material and denotes the art movement According to the assumptions encoded in this DAG art material genre and art movement are confounders influencing both the artist and the artwork Further art movement influences the art material Let us assume that all of the confounders are observable Under these assumptions in order to model the style of Van Gogh ie we have to block the backdoor path from to Section so as to remove confounding bias Specifically for graph i in Figure the following equation captures the causal effect of on For the case study implies do Artist Van Gogh The summation in indicates that one has to consider all possible art movements art materials and genres that the artist has worked in order to model their style The implication of finding a sufficient set is that stratifying on is guaranteed to remove all confounding bias relative to the causal effect of on Thus modeling artists style requires knowledge about the causal process governing the artworks creation Models like that do not consider the influence of confounders like art movement are prone to omitted variable bias and confounding bias Art movements were characterized by many socio-cultural and political events and reflect the dynamic influence of these events on art Thus by ignoring this variable there is a bias in capturing the artists style in understanding the arts intent and in representing culture Based on the DAG the causal effect may or may not be identifiable differs from the conditional distribution and the difference between the two distributions ie defines confounding bias Figure i depicted a scenario with no unobserved confounders In presence of unobserved confounders causal effects are not identifiable Consider Figure ii Let represent emotions of the artist The dotted circle and lines denote the unobserved confounder and its influence on other variables In this case even knowing the joint distribution of genre art movement and material does not help in identifying Van Goghs style ie is not identifiable In general several subjective factors like prior beliefs emotions cultural values etc can influence the artist and the artwork Thus in reality the true style of any artist cannot be accurately modeled Even if confounding bias due to unobserved factors is overlooked there are other biases as discussed next Figure i Confounding bias due to genre material and art movements ii Confounding bias due to artists unobserved emotions Figure i Example of selection bias ii Illustration of see Section iii Illustration of selection bias in datasets see Section Causal effect of on is not identifiable across i ii and iii Sample Selection bias Sample selection bias or selection bias for short is the bias that is induced by preferential selection of units for data analysis In a DAG a special variable is used to denote the selection of the variable in the analysis indicating selection and indicating otherwise Consider for example Figure i Here and indicates that both inputs and outputs are selection dependent ie with respect to both and The case study discussed below will further clarify these concepts Case Study To illustrate selection bias let us consider an example described in the ArtGAN model The authors state that their model is able to recognize artist Gustave Dores preferences as the generated images resonate with the dull color found in Dores artworks Mostly engravings were selected for analysis Graph ii in Figure depicts a possible DAG for this case Let denote Dores style depicts the selection of engravings in the analysis Further as the authors mention the generated images are greyish due to the engravings considered thus where denotes generated image Additionally there may be some unobserved confounders that influence both and as denoted by the bi-directional dotted arrow and there may be some other Artgan model variable that influences the nature of generated image these are depicted in Figure ii In order to be able to recover the causal effect of on under selection bias lists the conditions known as selection backdoor criteria Formally let be a set of variables partitioned into two groups and such that contains all non-descendants of and the descendants of and let stand for the graph that includes the selection mechanism is said to satisfy the selection backdoor criterion if the following conditions are true i blocks all backdoor paths from to in ii and block all paths between and in iii and block all paths between and in iv and are measured In Figure ii the path between and is not blocked due to the presence of direct link between the two variables thus condition iii in selection backdoor criteria is not satisfied Hence Dores style cannot be recovered based on the engravings considered in the analysis In fact in addition to engravings Dores worked on paintings For example landscapes such as The Lost Cow paintings such as Little Red Riding Hood religious painting such as The Wrestle of Jacob are not greyish and exhibit colors reflective of the genre Thus by merely selecting engravings for analysis sample selection bias is induced and style of Dore cannot be identified Note the failure to capture Dores style in can be additionally attributed to other types of biases such as confounding bias label bias and even framing effect bias For the purpose of illustrating selection bias we have focused on describing selection bias only In general there can be more than one type of bias in a case study Case Study As an other example of selection bias consider the case of As illustrated in Figure racial bias was evident in this application Figure ii can also be used to describe this scenario Let denote the set of input images selected for analysis and let represent the generated images Selection of Renaissance portraits of mostly white people was used in the analysis thus As evident the generated images were portraits of fair skinned people thus Additionally there could be unobserved confounders influencing both the input images and generated images and there may be model parameters influencing the generated images As condition iii in selection backdoor criteria is not satisfied there is selection bias Transportability bias Style transfer is a popular application in generative art Various works have demonstrated transferring across artists styles eg Cezanne to Monet and across art media eg photograph to painting Learning models that can generalize across domains is commonly known as transfer learning in the deep learning community and as transportability in the causality community Transportability defines the conditions under which causal effects learned in experimental studies can be transferred into to a new population in which only observational studies can be conducted The differences between the populations of interest are expressed through representations called as selection diagrams To this end DAGs are augmented with a set of selection variables where each member of corresponds to a mechanism by which the two populations differ and switching between the two populations will be represented by conditioning on different values of these variables variables locate the mechanisms where structural discrepancies between the two domains are suspected to take place Transportability bias arises if causal effects cannot be transferred across populations Figure i An example Selection diagram SD ii SD for case study and iii SD illustrating case study Causal effect of on is not identifiable across all scenarios i ii and iii The conditions under which causal effects can be transported are listed in Formally let be the selection diagram characterizing the two populations and with observational distributions and and a set of selection variables in The relation is transportable from to if and only if the expression is reducible using rules of do-calculus Sec to an expression in which appears only as a conditioning variable in do-free terms Given a DAG open source tools like can check for causal effects transportability automatically As an illustration consider Figure i Let the variable denote artist and denote the artwork Suppose the variable is an unobserved confounder denoting subjective emotions of the artist Between any two artists this variable is bound to cause differences and hence the selection variable is pointing to to indicate this difference For this DAG the causal effect of on is not transportable or transferable across the two artists For illustrative purposes we will ignore the differences due to unobserved factors such as subjective emotions of artists and consider differences in observed variables There can still be transportability bias as illustrated through the following case studies Case Study In a model that can transfer photograph to an artists style is proposed say photograph and Cezanne for illustration For simplicity we consider only one genre say landscapes The goal is to model Cezannes style in rendering the landscape corresponding to the photo Consider Figure ii which illustrates one possible selection diagram for this case study Let denote artist/photographer and let denote the artwork/photo Thus there are two populations corresponding to the choice of and ie photographer/photo and artist/artwork For the style transfer problem we want to be able to capture the causal effect of the artist on the artwork using the photograph The shaded squares marked by the symbol are the selection variables and are used to denote differences in the two populations Further there may other unobserved confounders However to illustrate biases beyond the difference in unobserved confounders we will overlook such confounders in this case study The factors that influence an artist are different from those that influence a photographer For example Cezanne could be influenced by the art movement whereas the photographer may be influenced by the photography trends This distinction is indicated by the selection variable pointing into Further the factors that affect the artwork may be different in the two populations A Figure Center Propellers a Cubist work by Fernand Leger Right Armoured Train in Action a Futurism work by Gino Severini Left translation of the center image according to the style of right image by Movement a key aspect of Futurism is missing in the translation Image source photograph may be subject to the camera characteristics lighting and measurement errors selection variable pointing to denotes this difference When the distinction is associated with the target variable ie in Figure ii causal effects are not transportable Thus there will be transportability bias In fact in post-impressionism the art movement primarily associated with Cezanne artists had their own individual styles As mentioned in Cezanne concentrated on pictorial problems of creating depth in his landscapes He used an organized system of layers to construct a series of horizontal planes which build dimension and draw the viewer into the landscape This technique is apparent in some of his works such as Mont Sainte-Victoire the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley and The Gulf of Marseille Seen from LEstaque In some of his works such as Gardanne Cezanne painted the landscape with intense volumetric patterns of geometric rhythms most pronounced in the houses reflective of Cubism The generated images in do not exhibit such geometric rhythms Case Study In the previous case study we analyzed bias in the context of style transfer from one genre to another from photograph to landscape As another illustration let us consider the problem of style transfer across art movements and genres In order to demonstrate transportability bias in this setting we consider DeepArtio an online platform that maps the style of one image to the content of the other using a neural network architecture We consider a case study that involves Cubism and Futurism two art movements in the modern art era Both these movements had many common aspects yet they diverged in subtle ways Therefore we find it to be an interesting case study for analysis Both Cubism and Futurism focus on representation of objects from multiple perspectives/viewpoints and emphasize on geometrical shapes Cubism is concerned with forms in static relationships while Futurism is concerned with them in a kinetic state Futurism emphasized on objects and events that involved movement such as wars energy of nightclub and so on As such we consider the following artworks for the case study Propellers center image in Figure was a Cubist art by Fernand Leger Leger was fascinated with technology in particular with propellers and viewed them as objects of beauty holding them close to sculptures Right image in Figure is a Futurism art by Gino Servini called Armored Train in Action Severini was inspired by Cubism but was a member of Futurism Futurism used Figure Center Miss Mary Ellison a Realism artwork by Mary Cassatt Right Erna an Expressionism artwork by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner Left translation of the center image according to the style of right image by Distorted subjects a key aspect of Expressionism is absent in the translation Image source art as a symbol for expressing political and social views Severini depicted aspects of war movement and modernity in this work Figure ii can be a potential DAG for this case study note there can be other DAGs based on assumptions The differences in Cubism and Futurism art movements combined with the differences in genre influences the artists differently and the artwork differently Also there is the effect of unobserved factors such as the artists emotions that influence the artist and the artwork The left most image in Figure corresponds to the Futurism version of Propellers Kinetic patterns which is a distinct feature of Futurism is absent in the translated image Given that the original image is that of a mechanical object propellers a Futurism version of it should have depicted the movement of the propellers much like in Armoured train in Action that shows the fractured landscape which accentuates the trains force and momentum as it cuts through the countryside Thus there is bias in transferring styles Case Study The previous case study encompassed style transfer across art movements which were similar in many ways We now consider a case study involving style transfer between Realism and Expressionism two art movements that have marked differences from one another We consider common genre namely portraits across the two art movements Thus this case study serves as a good test to see if style transfer from is effective given that the difference between two styles is significant Realism focuses on representing subject matter truthfully without artificiality and avoiding implausible exotic and supernatural elements The center image in Figure is an Realism portrait by Mary Cassatt Expressionists on the other hand used gestural brushstrokes and distorted subjects to portray intense emotions through their works The right image in Figure is an expressionism portrait by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner As can be observed the facial features in the right image have been distorted eg sharp chin resulting in an almost triangular facial contour pointed nose and ears to intensify emotions The left image in Figure is the style translated version of the center image Aesthetic innovations typical of an avante-garde movement like Expressionism are not evident in the style translated version As Kirchner himself said in Expressionism objective correctness of things is not emphasized rather a new appearance is created through radical distortions of subjects to evoke intense emotional experiences The style translated version is exactly as the original but for some color changes Figure i Black Matriarch a Folkart by Clementine Hunter ii Expressionism version of i by iii Giovinetto a Renaissance sculpture by Desiderio da Settignano iv Expressionism version of iii by Face color of Black Matriarch is changed in the translation unlike in Giovinetto a white sculpture Image source The image neither exhibits any distorted features nor has gestural brushstrokes that portray intense emotions Thus the style translation does not capture the subtleties of the Expressionism art movement Case Study As another case study to demonstrate biases in style transfer we consider GoART This app allows a user to convert an uploaded photo into various styles spanning art movements such as Byzantine Expressionism Cubism Ukiyo-e and artists such as Van Gogh We consider a folk art by Clementine Hunter titled Black Matriarch shown in Figure i Figure ii shows the Expressionism version of the Black Matriarch from As can be noticed the face is tinted in red However this kind of effect is not pronounced in light colored faces Consider Figure iii This is an early Renaissance sculpture by Desiderio da Settignano The face in the Expressionism version of this sculpture Figure iv does not seem to have shades of red as significant as in Figure ii Similar results were observed with other styles such as Byzantine wherein the face of Black Matriarch was tinted with shades of blue while the fairer faces were not heavily tinted There is noticeable difference in the way faces are converted across styles based on the color of the face indicating potential racial biases Case Study We consider AbacusAIs online tool that converts a user uploaded photo into a different gender male to female and vice versa One of their demos shows translation of the Renaissance painting of Mona Lisa into a masculine face Thus we experimented with other Renaissance paintings Figure i is a portrait of a man holding an apple by Raphael and Figure iii is a portrait of a young man by Italian artist Piero di Cosimo Figure ii and iv are the gender translated versions of i and iii by both of which fail to identify the original paintings as those of men Young men with long hair were mistaken to be women and thus the gender-translated versions of these images depicted masculine faces with beards In the Renaissance era it was common for young men to have long hair often extending from ears to shoulders Thus by not understanding the differences due to culture across genders and age men are being stereotyped as having short hair and thus exhibits transportability bias BIASES IN DATASETS In this section we discuss biases due to unrepresentative datasets and due to inconsistencies in annotation Figure i Portrait of a man by Raphael iii Portrait of a young man by Cosimo ii iv Gender translations of i and iii respectively Young men with long hair were mistaken as women by Representational bias The bias that arises because of having a dataset that is not representative of the real world is referred to as representational bias This is a particular type of selection bias Specifically in the context of art datasets there may be imbalances with respect to art genres eg large number of photographs vs few sculptures artists eg mostly European artists vs few native artists art movements large number of works concerning Renaissance and modern art movements as opposed to others and so on The availability of artworks is one of the main constraints in collecting a dataset that is representative of the bygone times but preferences of the dataset curators can also play a role in contributing to bias Case Study Consider that was trained using about Renaissance portraits of mostly white people Quite naturally the system performs poorly on dark skinned people Faces depicting different races appearances etc have not been pooled into the dataset thus contributing to representational bias This is a particular instance of selection bias that has to do with dataset curation Algorithms trained using datasets with severe class imbalances are bound to be biased Figure iii illustrates this Suppose denotes artist and denotes artworks then class imbalances corresponds to ie type of artworks influences selection into the dataset in this case mostly white Renaissance portraits were selected into the dataset As condition iii fails in selection backdoor criteria there is representational bias Label bias This type of bias is associated with the inconsistencies in the labeling process Different annotators may have different preferences which can get reflected in the labels created A common instance of label bias arises when different annotations could be used to represent an artwork For example a scene with clouds may be annotated as a cloudscape by some annotators and more generally as a landscape by others Yet another type of label bias arises when subjective biases of evaluators can affect labeling Confirmation bias a type of human bias is closely related to this type of label bias For example in a task of annotating emotions associated with artworks the labels could be biased by the subjective preferences of annotators such as their culture beliefs and introspective capabilities Consider the Behance Artistic Media dataset which provides labels based on emotions such as happy scary peaceful etc Such labels could be based on annotators beliefs and can therefore be noisy Case Study To illustrate how annotation inconsistencies can induce bias consider the ArtGAN model This model uses the label information to train the GANs discriminator The authors claim that by using labels pertaining to genre cityscapes portraits etc art media eg sketch and study engraving and style eg Ukiyo-e they are able to generate images of those categories However the annotations are not necessarily reliable indicators of genres or styles For example sketch and study category includes several other categories such as portraits religious paintings and allegorical works to name a few Figure iii illustrates this bias Let and denote the environments corresponding to two different annotators Suppose denotes art movements style eg Ukiyo-e and is the artwork Annotation inconsistencies across annotators affects the artworks labels this is indicated by the selection variable pointing to When there are differences in the target variable ie label of artworks the causal effect of on is not identifiable using the annotations provided Thus a generative model that leverages such labels in modeling style is prone to bias DISCUSSION Art is much more than an aesthetic entity As elaborated in art imparts moral knowledge ie knowledge about what ought to do and not to do Art also enables emphathic knowledge something through which one can compare different views of the world through direct experience Art initiates a conversation with the public it is a form of language that is not just a mimicry but a symbolic transposition Art is a form of technology that contributes to knowledge production by exemplifying aspects of the world that would otherwise go overlooked Thus given its powerful impact in shaping moral and empathetic values generative art comes with the responsibility of creating art that respects and upholds societal ethics By coloring the face of the Black Matriarch is not only depicting racial bias but also inaccurate in its representation of the art movement As artist Edgar Degas remarks Art is not just what you see but what you make others see Thus generative art that does not promote diversity and inclusiveness has the potential of creating and communicating unethical values Art reflects cognitive abilities of the artist Cognitive abilities include perception memory emotions and other latent aspects about the artist Generative art that is meant to create art in the style of various artists must reflect and respect artists cognitive abilities and not stereotype them based on any narrowly defined metric For example often style of Van Gogh is largely modeled based on the brushstrokes in his rendition Starry Nights or based on certain colors such as in Similarly style of Cezanne in little reflects the variety of geometric patterns that were prominent in his works Needless to mention that cognitive aspects of the artist are not considered As discussed in Section and majority of these issues arise due to framing effect bias and algorithmic bias Often style is defined and modeled in a way to suit the algorithms performance Not only are several important abilities and achievements of artists overlooked in the process of poor style modeling but also those pertaining to larger art movements are ignored For example advanced techniques such as exaggerated foreshortening and perspective modeling that were typical of many Ukiyo-e renditions are hardly visible in the generated versions In a recent photo booth titled Latent Face latent vectors of the styleGAN model were combined to generate hypothetical children of subjects depicted in the original portraits While this may have been an exploratory experiment the task exemplifies framing effect bias Defining children as combination of latent vectors is highly questionable The latent vectors may or may not have any reliable interpretation and a very difficult and potentially impossible problem of generating faces of hypothetical children is conveniently framed as a simple task There are also several ethical concerns associated with such a framing given that people depicted in the original portraits were not related or never had children Framing effect bias coupled with algorithmic bias contributes to inaccurate knowledge about history Artworks were often meant to document important events in history such as wars mythological events political movements etc By wrongly modeling or overlooking certain subtle aspects generative art can contribute to false perceptions about social cultural and political aspects of past times and hinder awareness about important historical events For example as discussed in case study in the Futurism artwork Armored Train in Action artist Severini conveys his views on war that was prevalent during the time In fact Futurism artists heavily depicted their views of political events through patterns indicating movement in the artworks A generated style translation should thus preserve such important characteristics of art movements or else they will be contributing to a bias in understanding history People have a propensity to favor suggestions from automated systems and to ignore contradictory information even if it is correct This is called as automation bias Thus people may give little importance to historical evidence Further often evaluation of generative art is done by people eg Amazon Mechanical Turk workers who do not necessarily possess domain knowledge Thus even if generated art is not accurately representing cultural and historical knowledge people may endorse them Tutorials like and emphasize on the need to inspect the design choices made by the creators of AI systems and the sociopolitical contexts that shape their deployment Can algorithms accurately model artists styles More broadly is the defined problem even solvable How can representative datasets and reliable labels be created to address the defined problem What are the measurement biases in digitally capturing art What are the sociocultural impacts of generative art Does generative art promote inclusiveness Who should own responsibility for biases in generative art These are just some questions that need to be analyzed Also domain experts eg art historians should be involved in the generative art pipeline to better inform the process of art creation CONCLUSIONS In this paper we investigated biases in the generative art AI pipeline from the perspective of art history Leveraging structural causal models we highlighted how current methods fall short in modeling the process of art creation and illustrated instances of framing effect bias dataset bias selection bias confounding bias and transportability bias We also discussed the socio-cultural impacts of these biases We hope our work sparks inter-disciplinary dicussions and inspires new directions concerning accountability
