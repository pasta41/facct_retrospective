When the Umpire is also a Player Bias in Private Label Product Recommendations on E-commerce Marketplaces Algorithmic recommendations mediate interactions between millions of customers and products in turn their producers and sellers on large e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon In recent years the producers and sellers have raised concerns about the fairness of black-box recommendation algorithms deployed on these marketplaces Many complaints are centered around marketplaces biasing the algorithms to preferentially favor their own private label products over competitors These concerns are exacerbated as marketplaces increasingly de-emphasize or replace organic recommendations with ad-driven sponsored recommendations which include their own private labels While these concerns have been covered in popular press and have spawned regulatory investigations to our knowledge there has not been any public audit of these marketplace algorithms In this study we bridge this gap by performing an end-to-end systematic audit of related item recommendations on Amazon We propose a network-centric framework to quantify and compare the biases across organic and sponsored related item recommendations Along a number of our proposed bias measures we find that the sponsored recommendations are significantly more biased toward Amazon private label products compared to organic recommendations While our findings are primarily interesting to producers and sellers on Amazon our proposed bias measures are generally useful for measuring link formation bias in any social or content networks CONCEPTS Human-centered computing Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing KEYWORDS Recommendation e-commerce marketplace algorithmic auditing INTRODUCTION With millions of customers relying on e-commerce platforms for their day-to-day purchase needs many small sellers and producers depend on these platforms for their livelihood Given the scale of these marketplaces search and recommendation systems deployed by the e-commerce platforms effectively mediate interactions between customers and sellers/producers For instance customers often search for specific items they are aware of land on the corresponding item pages and then follow the related item recommendations on that page to explore similar or complimentary items they would not have visited otherwise In addition to helping customers explore the item space prior studies have shown that such recommendations are major drivers of traffic and revenue for many e-commerce platforms However the algorithm deciding which item is related to another item is often a black box and in recent years different producers and sellers have raised concerns about the fairness of such black box algorithms Platforms can explicitly design recommendations to bias the exposure of products ie steer customers to items they wish to promote at the expense of other items by linking items independent of their mutual relevance This concern has been exacerbated by many e-commerce platforms eg Amazon systematically altering and sometimes replacing organic recommendations with sponsored advertisements These sponsored ads are often interspersed with the organic recommendations on the product pages making it hard to disambiguate between the two A recent survey of more than Amazon customers revealed that half of the respondents did not even realize being advertised to on Amazon product pages Thus sponsored recommendations offer a powerful option to platforms to explicitly steer customers toward or away from certain products How severe are the concerns Such concerns about biases are especially important today due to the emergence of different private label products in e-commerce marketplaces A private label product is produced and sold by the platform itself providing enough monetary incentive to be discriminative against other products or producers on the platform For example a recent Wall Street Journal article claimed that Amazon restricts the ability of Tier Competitors Amazons lingo for largest rivals in a category to buy ads on their platforms when searched for private label gadgets like Fire TV or Echo Show E-commerce platforms i dominating control over the marketplace which effectively makes their competing producers their customers for distribution ii vertical integration the fact that they both sell goods as retailers and host sales by others as a marketplace and iii ability to amass swaths of customer information raises concerns of economic monopoly Notably it is this last factor control over information that enhances the anti-competitive potential of the first two Considering the prevailing situation a US Senator recently remarked that a platform can either be an umpire or a player but not both These concerns are prompting policymakers to consider regulating online marketplaces For example in a recent regulation the Indian government has asked online marketplaces to provide fair treatments to every seller on their platforms European Commission has launched an antitrust probe into Amazons treatment of independent sellers in its platform Similar concerns have been raised by the US regulators During the antitrust subcommittee hearings held in July Amazon was inquired whether it treats products and sellers with special relationships differently than any of their third party counterparts In the subsequent report the committee has recommended possible disentanglement of Amazons marketplace from its private label businesses Our contributions Although this study can potentially be done on any e-commerce marketplace here we focus on the Amazon marketplace and study the following research question Do Amazon private label products get an unfair share of recommendations and are therefore advantaged compared to rd party products Specifically we consider the related item recommendations on Amazon product pages and attempt to quantify the biases in sponsored recommendations compared to the organic session similarity recommendations toward Amazon private label products To this end we collect recommendation data from over backpacks and batteries on amazon in and investigate the extent of bias towards Amazon private labels in sponsored recommendations We propose to model these recommendations as Related Item Networks RINs where we view item recommendations as a directed network in which nodes correspond to items and there is a directed edge from node i to node if item is recommended on the page of item i Note that we have two instantiations of RIN one for organic recommendations and another for sponsored recommendations Given the network-centric formulation of recommendations we pose the problem of detecting bias in recommendations as follows Given two directed networks over the same set of nodes but belonging to different groups how can we quantify the link formation bias towards an advantaged group of nodes eg Amazon private label products in our context in one network compared to the other In this work we investigate the link formation bias in sponsored RIN by comparing it to the organic RIN assuming the latter to be an unbiased baseline representation of the real world user behavior We propose different measures for quantifying biases i promotion bias ii ranking bias ii core representation bias and iv exposure bias All these different bias measures consistently point to significant bias towards Amazon private label products in the sponsored recommendations Isnt bias in sponsored recommendations expected One might argue that sponsored recommendations are expected to be biased towards the products being sponsored ie advertised by their corresponding sellers However sponsored recommendations in the context of e-commerce platforms are different from sponsored results in generic search engines for the following reasons Sponsored and organic recommendations are far less decoupled in e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon While many ads on generic online sites are complementary those on the e-commerce marketplaces are competitive Additionally sponsored product recommendations can have significant delayed impact on the organic recommendations as sales volume click through and browsing patterns are important factors influencing the latter Furthermore Amazons private label products compete against products from other sellers and brands for ad-space on an uneven playing field because Amazon is both the ad publisher and runs the ad exchange Amazon may already have information of bids for ad-spaces from sellers of competing products as well as the ability to unilaterally reserve some ad-spaces once again being both an umpire as well as a player These situations may initiate a feedback loop that could potentially prove disadvantageous to the other rd party producers registered with the marketplace Thus we posit that the biases in sponsored results should not go unnoticed To the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic audit as opposed to the mostly speculative news articles of the sponsored and organic recommendations on Amazon marketplace We hope that our findings will inform and encourage further deliberations of the algorithms deployed by e-commerce platforms bringing greater transparency to online marketplaces RELATEDWORK Bias in recommendation systems Biases in recommendations are studied in past literature For example popular items are more likely to be recommended leading to rich get richer effects and there are some attempts to mitigate the same Another strand of research on fairness in recommendation has emerged around the main stakeholder in recommendation framework ie customers Recently few works have advocated for fairness toward both customers and providers leading to nuanced algorithms considering two-sided fairness While the fairness community seems to have covered different forms of biases in recommendation frameworks it has overlooked the special relationships that may exist between the digital marketplace and a subset of the entities and the biases thereof In this work our goal is to audit and study the effect of the marketplace in the related item recommendation space to uncover such biases Auditing online platforms Recently researchers have begun looking at the potential societal harms posed by opaque algorithmic systems Researchers of algorithm auditing aim to produce methodologies that enable regulators to examine black-box systems and understand their impact on different stakeholders Mechanisms have been developed for auditing bias in ad-delivery systems dynamic pricing personalization and performance of search engines information segregation radicalization and reachability by recommendation systems to mention a few However none of the prior works have studied the biases toward entities having special relationship with the marketplace especially in the context of product recommendations Current study While most of the prior studies have raised concerns on different algorithms deployed on online platforms to our knowledge this is the first attempt to understand how perturbing related item recommendations from organic recommendations to sponsored ad recommendations can impact different items and their producers in an online marketplace like Amazon as well as the resultant biases toward entities having special relationship with the marketplace With respect to the algorithmic audit nomenclature taxonomy proposed by Sandvig et al our study falls under the scraping audit category since we rely on crawled data to audit the effects of sponsored recommendations Other audit methodologies are either not available to us or are not useful For example we cannot perform a code audit without privileged access to Amazon recommendation algorithms source codes THE AMAZON MARKETPLACE BACKGROUND AND FAIRNESS CONCERNS Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world selling thousands of products across more than categories There are three major stakeholders in the Amazon marketplace customers sellers and the producers of products brands Due to attractive loyalty programs and customer-friendly return and pricing strategies Amazon enjoys huge brand equity among customers Apart from the customers Amazon provides major business opportunities for nearly million active sellers worldwide Special relationships The producers or brands who manufacture the products sold at the Amazon marketplace can be divided into two categories third party P brands and Amazon private label brands and the corresponding products are P products and Amazon private label PL products respectively P brands are standalone brands eg Apple Adidas Skybags whose products are sold on Amazon under their respective brand names On the other hand Amazon private label products are produced by Amazon itself Some of the Amazon-owned most successful private label brands are AmazonBasics Amazon Collection Amazon Essentials Pinzon Solimo etc These brands compete with traditional brands across multiple product categories such as electronics fashion jewelry etc Amazon currently offers approximately private label products some of which have additional variations such as color and size across brands in the Amazon store Note that as per Amazons response to the US House antitrust subcommittees questions all of the Amazon private label products are sold by Amazon only In this paper we focus on potential biases toward such products having special relationship with Amazon Apart from products some sellers also have special relationships with the Amazon marketplace notably Fulfilled By Amazon FBA sellers and Amazon Affiliated AA sellers However investigating the biases against sellers is confounded by other factors such as the knowledge of how sellers win a buy box and if winning the buy box has any role to play in the recommendations received by the seller Thus such an analysis requires its own treatment and nuances therefore we leave the analysis of seller bias as a future direction in this line of work Concerns about potential biases The fact that Amazon both sells produces goods as a retailer and facilitates sales of others as a marketplace allows it to amass swaths of customer information giving it an edge over the competitors thus raising concerns of economic monopoly The primary concerns include but are not limited to a PL products getting unfair advantage in the marketplace and b sponsored ads slowly replacing organic search and recommendations which might further boost the visibility of PL products Concerns about PL products getting unfair advantage Recent media articles with anecdotal evidences have argued that PL products often get promoted unduly on the Amazon marketplace through retrieval systems which increases their exposure and potential sales over competing products by other producers brands Concerns about sponsored recommendations replacing organic recommendations Typically on Amazon one can find various types of recommendations including i substitute items based on session similarity Customers who viewed this item also viewed recommendations and ii complementary items based on purchase similarity Customers who bought this item also bought These recommendations are organic recommendations ie driven by customers viewing purchasing behavior However in recent times Amazon has started showing another type of recommendations iii sponsored related items Sponsored products related to this item which is a part of the advertising program that Amazon has taken up lately The order in which the recommendations appear is not fixed and organic recommendations are often interspersed with sponsored advertisements making it hard to disambiguate between them Economic aspects of sponsored advertisements One might argue that sponsored ads are meant to be biased toward promoting sellers and brands who pay for these ads However the important point to note here is that sponsored recommendations are often non-transparent and are influenced by commercial interests For example it is not explicitly mentioned who pays Amazon for placing the private label ads in the sponsored recommendations or whether Amazon allocates free ad space to its private label products Upon being asked about the same in the US congress anti-trust hearing during July Amazon replied the following Like all retailers Amazon makes decisions about how to use the space in its stores based on a variety of factors centered on what customers will find most helpful Of course when the company chooses not to use space for advertising by third parties Amazon foregoes the advertising fees it The buy box is shown on every product page on Amazon and it contains the price of the product shipping information the name of the seller who has got the buy box and a button to purchase the product More details on Sponsored products sponsored-products/faqhtml could have earned from that space Deciding whether Amazon should use its store space to show ads from third parties or for merchandising placements highlighting Amazons private brand products depends on many variables including for example the customers query what type of product the customer is shopping for and whether the customer is shopping on desktop mobile or in Amazons app When private label products and other rd party products compete for ad-space on Amazon it may not be a level playing field because Amazon may already have information of the bids that others are placing for ad-spaces Further since Amazon is also the marketplace it can unilaterally reserve some ad-spaces without being accountable for such reservations as clear from the responses of Amazon This can potentially increase the advertising cost for the remaining ad-spaces In fact these concerns were also raised by the US regulators wherein they asked how Amazon determines when it reserves the ad-space and what are its repercussions on the cost of advertising in remaining ad-spaces Similar concerns have also been echoed in government of Indias Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade DPIIT statement Current study While there are anecdotal articles regarding the unfair advantages that PL products potentially enjoy in Amazon there is no data-driven postmortem of the platform to discover evidences if any of such unfair treatments We perform the first systematic data-driven audit of both organic and sponsored recommendations for the same category of items We show how different sponsored recommendations are from the organic recommendations through a number of measures all of which seem to indicate that sponsored recommendations ads promote Amazon PLs much more than the organic recommendations DATASET GATHERED This section discusses our strategy for collecting data from Amazon and the dataset collected for our analyses Data collection process Amazon shows various lists of related items on the webpage of every item For the present study we focused on collecting all recommendations shown for items in two specific categories out of the categories defined by Amazon Backpack and Battery Why these two categories We wanted to investigate categories where Amazon has several PL products competing with P products There are many categories as defined by Amazon itself where there are PL products eg fashion electronics etc However the range of items in these broad categories is too large and therefore the conclusions can be misleading as well Hence we decided to analyse a category which is lower down the category hierarchy and where Amazon is one of the largest producers in the category The Backpack category is one such category where Amazon produces a fair amount of products under different PL brands Also Battery is the category where Amazon first introduced its PL products and currently holds a large fraction of the market share While collecting data for a compact category like backpack battery we could cover most other backpacks batteries that are in direct competition on the marketplace Please refer to the questions in for Amazons official response Category Items Organic Sponsored Backpack Battery Table Statistics of the dataset collected from backpack and battery category products on Amazon in Recommendations collected We collected the following two types of recommendations for items as shown on its webpage The substitutable item recommendations that Amazon shows as customers who viewed this item also viewed These are other items that are viewed by customers while looking at the source item during the same session of exploration Since these recommendations are obtained from natural browsing behaviour of the customer henceforth we refer to these as organic recommendations The recommendations shown by Amazon under the heading Sponsored products related to this item We refer to these recommendations as sponsored recommendations As indicated earlier we chose to collect these two types of recommendations specifically to understand the effects of the recently raised concern that Amazon is gradually replacing organic recommendations with sponsored ads recommendations Crawling methodology To collect these recommended lists we designed crawlers performing snowball sampling on the Amazon India site amazon in The crawlers were seeded with an initial item and the recommendations against the item were scraped New items encountered in this process were pushed to a queue and the same process was repeated on every item in the queue We used browser automation for our data collection Specifically we used Gecko driver and Mozilla Firefox browser to collect the data All the data were collected in one session of data collection from an Amazon account having prime membership We continued the crawls till the queue was exhausted to ensure that we collected the whole universe of items or at least a large connected component of the universe of items The order of visiting product pages was influenced by the order in which the products appear in the BFS queue While visiting the product pages we made sure not to visit the same product page multiple times because that may have led to more recommendations for the corresponding products The total number of items from each of the two categories whose data we could collect from the Amazon website is listed in Table Along with the two types of recommendations we also collected metadata about each product eg average user rating number of reviews brand seller who won the buy box during the crawl etc Producer/brand and related details There are and brands present in the backpack and battery datasets respectively Nearly and of the products in the backpack and battery datasets respectively constitute Amazon PL products which are majorly from three brands AmazonBasics Amazon Brand-Solimo and Amazon Gear We collate all of them to the common brand name Amazon In the rest of this paper we will compare the organic session similarity recommendations and the sponsored recommendations for biases toward Amazon PL products due to the latter We took some precautions to ensure the meaningfulness of the comparative analysis The recommendation algorithms deployed on the websites are likely to tailor recommendations based on several Items Related items A B C D B E C C D E A CB E D Figure A sample RS showing a list of items with their related items and its corresponding RIN signals including the geographical location customer browsing history and so on Also the recommendations are known to vary with time To minimize these variations we collected the recommendations from the same IP address during the same time-frame and from the same user account FRAMEWORK FOR AUDITING RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS Motivated by the fairness concerns discussed in Section this section aims to devise methodologies based on a network-centric framework to quantify the bias toward entities having special relationships with the Amazon marketplace In specific we consider the bias toward Amazon private label products in this work however the methodologies can be extended if suitable data is available to any other special relationships for eg relationships among different sellers and Amazon The framework We instantiate related item recommendations as a network called a Related Item Network RIN The RIN is a directed network where each node is an item product and the directed edge i implies that item is recommended on the page of item i For instance consider the set of items and recommendations shown in the table in Figure These recommendations can be represented by the RIN shown in the image next to the table For instance since B is recommended from A there exists a directed edge from A to B To distinguish between the RINs we refer to the RIN constructed from sponsored recommendations as sponsored RIN S and that from the organic recommendations as organic RIN O Why do we require two RINs Often it is difficult to quantify bias or unfairness in absolute terms However it is easier to establish the existence of biases when there exists an unbiased reference for comparison As specified in Section Amazon categorically labels the collected organic recommendations as items which are viewed by consumers in the same session Since the organic recommendations are obtained from the most natural form of browsing behaviour of consumers these recommendations can be thought of as a reasonable representation of the customer behavior and can be used as a baseline for further studies However we also acknowledge that there are several other kind of biases eg bias toward different types of sellers on Amazon As mentioned in Section biases toward different type of sellers is beyond the scope of the current work Assuming the organic session similarity recommendations in Amazon platform to be an appropriate and unbiased representation of user activities we aim to quantify the relative bias if any toward Amazon private label products in the sponsored RIN S as compared to that in organic RIN O The generic research question Given the instantiation of recommendations as a RIN the problem of comparing the biases in recommendations reduces to the following network-centric problem Let S SI SE be two networks over a set of nodes where each node has a set of attributes A aa am Without any loss of generality let as be a sensitive attribute that partitions the set of nodes say SI into n groups G where SI based on the membership values of the nodes likewise for In our specific setup the sensitive attribute is whether an item is an Amazon PL which partitions the set of nodes into two groups PL and P products Our aim is to quantify the relative bias due to the link formation in networks toward an advantaged group of nodes for eg Amazon PLs Specifically in this work we examine the relative bias induced due to sponsored RIN S with respect to the organic RIN assuming O to be an unconditional representation of the user behaviour Since both the sponsored and organic RINs are networks on the same set of items henceforth we use the symbol I to denote the set of items ie for our case SI I It can be noted that the problem of identifying biases in networks towards a certain group of nodes can emerge in various other contexts as well For example given a pair or more of social networks of users one might compare the bias due to link formation toward a socially salient group of users in one of the networks in comparison to the other networks The methodologies discussed in this section would be useful in such contexts as well Methodologies for evaluation of bias In this section we enumerate a series of methods through which we shall evaluate the relative bias toward PL products in the sponsored RIN with respect to the organic RIN Promotion bias In-degree of an item i I in the RIN is the number of other items on whose page item i is recommended A higher in-degree is very likely to drive more customers toward the given item since such an item is very highly promoted on the web-page of other items Hence we consider the promotion of a node i in a recommendation system be its in-degree in the corresponding RIN Specifically promotion of node i I in the sponsored RIN S is PS i in-degreeS i and that in the organic RIN O is PO i in-degree O i We contrast the average PS ii I with PO ii I separately for the two groups of nodes PLs vs Ps Ranking bias Network centrality measures eg in-degree closeness centrality eigenvector centrality etc are often used to examine the most central or important nodes in networks Having a better rank in these ranked lists is often an indication that the corresponding nodes are in some advantageous position in the current network structure In the fairness literature a number of measures have been proposed to quantify the bias in a given ranked list of candidates We use the normalized discounted KL divergence measure proposed in to evaluate the extent of mixing of the different groups PL and P products in our case in the ranked lists The measure follows the notion of statistical parity fairness and evaluates whether at different check-points this statistical parity is preserved ie whether PL and P have proportional representation at the check-points Further the measure also penalizes under-representation at the top-end of the ranked list more than under-representation in the lower part of the ranked list Given a ranked list R with indicating the most fair ranked list and indicating the most unfair ranking Through this analysis we intend to contrast how good is the mixing of Amazon PL and P products in the ranked lists obtained from the organic RIN O and sponsored RIN S Let Rs Ro be the centrality ranked lists obtained from S and O respectively We report the ratio A value much higher than for this ratio would suggest much higher bias ie the ranked list is much further away from a fair ranked list according to demographic parity in the sponsored RIN S as compared to the organic RIN O Representation in the core of the network In network science literature nodes are often characterized by their hierarchical location within the network Most of the highly central nodes reside in the innermost core of the network while slightly less important nodes reside in the second innermost core and so on and the least central nodes reside in the periphery A k-core is a maximal sub-graph that contains nodes of degree or more The core number of a given node i is the largest value of a k-core containing that node The nodes in the inner cores are often very strongly connected and therefore a large fraction of the shortest paths connecting pairs of nodes pass through the inner cores the nodes in the periphery and the outer cores of the network are mostly connected via the vertices residing in the innermost core of the network Hence being in the innermost core is analogous to being visited multiple times as users traverse the network In a RIN being in the innermost core or closer to it gives an item much more visibility as users browse the recommendations and thereby an opportunity of larger business To this end if the items in the advantaged are present in the inner cores of the network then they enjoy the benefit of being highly exposed In our setup we specifically investigate the representation of Amazon PLs in the inner stable cores of the organic RIN O and the sponsored RIN S To this end any significant disparity between the representation of Amazon PLs in the inner core of the RINs can be an indication of advantageous placement of the PLs in one of the RINs Exposure bias A major benefit of RS is the exposure it brings to different items among the consumers on the online system Higher exposure is synonymous to more likelihood of conversion to sales and hence higher revenue Ideally in an online system exposure of items should be measured by the number of clicks or the total time users spend on different items However such detailed user-item interaction information is not available to any third party due to privacy and business concerns making it difficult to audit/regulate existing recommendation systems One alternative is to count the number of other items from where an item has been recommended analogous to the in-degree of a node in the RIN which we have already considered in the Promotion Bias methodology However it needs to be considered that all recommendations are not of equal importance a recommendation to item i from a popular item is likely to give much higher exposure to i than from an unpopular item Hence a model for computing exposure of i should consider the importance of the items from which the recommendations to i are coming We use the well-known random surfer model to incorporate such considerations Computing exposure using RIN The random surfer model was originally proposed to model a user randomly surfing the Web graph to estimate the exposure of webpages which is measured as the PageRank of a webpage The random surfer model assumes that a user starts from a particular item and then randomly chooses one of the items recommended on this page and views the chosen item in the next step Alternatively the user can also randomly choose any other item from the universe of items for viewing in the next step This process goes on for a large potentially infinite number of steps In the course of this random walk some items will be visited more frequently by the surfer than other items We use the random surfer model specifically because it gives a convenient way to simulate a user exploring the item space universe of items via the recommendations given to her Therefore in this methodology we take the steady state visit frequency of a node i as an indicator of its exposure due to the RIN Note that exposure of a node is a slight variant of its PageRank in the RIN We need to consider several factors to make the random surfer setting practically resemble how a user is likely to browse recommendations For instance users are more likely to browse higher-ranked items in a list of recommendations on the page of a certain item i different users are likely to have different propensities to follow recommendations and so on We now describe these factors and how we make the random surfer setting practical Effect of presentation of items on a webpage When a list of items is being recommended on the web-page of an item i usually the presentation of these recommendations plays a vital role in the amount of exposure the recommended items get For instance the recommendations on the Amazon platform are shown in a slider of length depending on the users device Users have to press the next button to see the next recommendations In such scenarios the exposure of first items is higher than that of the subsequent items To account for this we give weights to the edges of the RINs ie every recommendation has a certain weight depending on the way it has been presented To this end based on the line of work on position bias in fairness in ranking we have focused on the geometric weight distribution model where the weights of the sliders are distributed geometrically with a parameter p up to the position n Geometrically distributed weights are a special case of the cascade model where each item has the same probability p of being clicked This is more suitable for the current set-up because items in the first slider are more likely to be clicked than the items in the subsequent sliders Mathematically if item is recommended on the page of item i and item is positioned in the t-th slider of the recommended list on the web-page of item i the weight of the directed edge i is considered p n Different users propensity to follow recommendations While modeling user browsing of recommendations one important aspect is the different propensity of different users to follow recommendations This propensity is captured in the random surfer model by the teleportation probability At every step the surfer chooses one of the items recommended on the current items page with probability and chooses to teleport to a For our experiments we set as observed during the Web crawls The reported results are keeping p random item in the universe with probability We performed experiments with different values of in and found the results to be qualitatively similar for all values Throughout the rest of the paper we report results for which is the default value prescribed in the random surfer model Long-tail popularity distribution of items In the vanilla random surfer model while teleporting the random surfer jumps uniformly at random to any of the items in the network However this is not necessarily true in an e-commerce platform Often people start at a popular item and then start exploring via recommendations They are directed toward these popular items either via ranking in the search results on Amazon or word-of-mouth recommendations etc To account for this phenomenon we biased the random surfer model so that while teleporting instead of jumping to items uniformly at random the random surfer follows the long-tail popularity distribution Thereby a popular item will have a higher chance of being teleported to To operationalize the popularity of an items we take the number of ratings reviews of the corresponding item as a proxy and normalize it to To distinguish between the exposure of an item i from the two RINs we refer to them as Organic exposure i derived from organic RIN and Sponsored exposure Es i derived from sponsored RIN respectively We normalize the exposure scores of all items nodes in a particular network such that i I Es i as well as i I i Exposure of a group of items As we defined exposure of an individual product item one can also compute the exposure of a group For simplicity we compute sponsored respectively organic exposure of a group of items as the sum of sponsored respectively organic exposure of all the products in the group The total sponsored exposure of a group can be obtained as Es i Es i and similarly for organic exposure of a group Exposure bias We define Exposure Bias bias as a measure of the difference between organic exposure and sponsored exposure of items We measure bias by the Kullback-Leibler KL divergence between the two distributions of sponsored exposure Es i IEs i and organic exposure i i bias S i I Es i Es i i bias S quantifies the perturbation caused by sponsored recommendations on the organic exposure of different items For a completely unbiased recommendation system bias S Categorization of items Given the organic and sponsored exposures of items we can check whether the treatment of individual items by the sponsored recommendation algorithm is fair We define an item i to be fairly adequately exposed if the ratio of its sponsored and organic exposure is close to Since this requirement may be too strict we relax it by considering three item categories depending on the ratio of sponsored and organic exposure falling within a threshold Relative Exposure Distortion a Under-exposed an item i under-exposed if Es i i b Over-exposed an item i over-exposed if Es i i and c Adequately-exposed If Es i is between and of i then item i is considered to be adequately exposed In this paper we use for proof of concept We believe any slight variation to will not change our observations significantly While this threshold has been used in multiple prior studies we acknowledge that the choice remains context dependent and can change based on the application and prior established regulations Influence of the sensitive attribute Till now in this section we have proposed a number of methodologies to evaluate the relative bias toward the advantaged group in the sponsored RIN S as compared to the organic RIN O However we have not yet touched upon the influence or effect if any of the sensitive attribute as on the treatment that different groups of items receive in the two RINs Now we describe a methodology to quantify how much influence the sensitive attribute eg Amazon private label membership has on the beneficial treatments of the products if any Note that reception of any benefit eg better promotion or rank or core number or exposure by a group of products might not always be an indication of bias Let us consider a scenario where the items which are of higher quality are being advantaged more in the sponsored networks In that case the platform Amazon in our case might argue that since these items are qualitatively better therefore to improve consumer experience they are being promoted excessively Thus along with quantifying biases benefits in exposure received by certain items it is equally important to investigate which attributes of the items have the most influence on the benefits To this end the following experiment is meant for explaining the importance of the sensitive attribute as rather than quantifying any biases based on it Intuition behind the analysis As mentioned earlier each node i has a set of attributes Ai am i Without any loss of generality let us assume as is a sensitive attribute eg gender or race or in our context existence of the special relation with the Amazon marketplace The aim of this analysis is to find out the difference in the relative importance of different attributes at it s on any beneficial commodity eg better promotion or exposure of nodes between the organic and sponsored RINs Through this analysis if we find a significant rise in the importance of the sensitive attribute as in determining the benefit of a node this can be an indication of some special treatments toward a group on the basis of as during the link formation in the sponsored RIN S as compared to the organic RIN O To this end we use Negative Binomial Regression NBR to perform this analysis NBR based approach NBR is a generalization of Poisson regression which slacks the restrictive assumption that the variance is equal to the mean made by the later Given a count-type dependent variable Ps i or PO i and a set of attributes Ai the model predicts which attributes correlate more with the dependent variable For each attribute the model gives a numeric estimate can be positive as well as negative of how strongly it correlates with the dependent variable A mathematical interpretation of these results can be by unit change in an attribute say ai the log of PS i or PO i will increase or decrease by the estimated number of units If the sensitive attribute is given a high numeric estimate relative to other attributes then the sensitive attribute can be said to have a selectively high influence on the values of PS i or PO i P PL In eg re e Organic RIN P PL In eg re e Sponsored RIN a P PL In eg re e Organic RIN P PL In eg re e Sponsored RIN b Figure Box-plots showing the median first and third quartile of in-degree distribution of Amazon PL products and that of P products in a battery and b backpack category RINs Note that the y-axes are in log scale The disparity in the in-degree distributions of PLs and P products increase significantly in the sponsored RIN across both categories RESULTS In this section we apply the proposed methodologies on the collected datasets to examine the relative bias in the sponsored RIN S with respect to the organic RIN O toward Amazon PL products Promotion bias In our first bias measure we investigate the promotion bias in the sponsored RINs toward Amazon PLs Note that promotion of an item in the RIN is its in-degree in the corresponding RIN A higher in-degree is likely to drive more customers toward the given item Not all P products are promoted in Sponsored RIN Intuitively we would expect a much smaller fraction of products to be sponsored advertised on a platform Indeed we observe that a very small fraction of the entire number of products that we collected have non-zero in-degree in the sponsored RINs ie were advertised at least once Specifically more than of the P products do not even get a single inward recommendation in the sponsored RINs in both backpack and battery categories However almost all Amazon PLs are recommended in the sponsored RIN in both the categories Thus Amazon does significant self-promotion for almost all their PL products in the sponsored RIN Amazon PLs get sponsored recommendation from half of the product space We observe that Amazon PLs get recommended from approximately distinct products in the entire product base in both categories in contrast to approximately in organic recommendations In other words almost half of the entire product space recommends at least one Amazon PL in its sponsored recommendations Whereas a very small fraction of the entire product space is recommended back from the Amazon PLs less than in both the categories in the sponsored recommendations In-degrees of different types of products Figure shows boxplots of in-degree distributions of all the nodes having non-zero in-degree All nodes items have been divided into two groups Amazon PLs and P products In the battery category there is a considerable disparity in the in-degree distributions of PL and P products in the organic RIN however the disparity increases significantly in case of the sponsored RIN Interestingly in the organic RIN of backpack category the in-degree distributions of both P and PL products are very similar however when we move Avg in-degree Backpack Battery Organic Sponsored Organic Sponsored All nodes Product category Amazon PLs P products Table Average in-degree for different kinds of products across sponsored and organic RINs The average in-degree of PL products sees tremendous increase in the sponsored RIN The differences in the in-degrees were statistically significant students t-test to sponsored RIN there is distinguishable difference in the in-degree distributions These box-plots clearly show the rise in disparity of the in-degree or promotion of PL products in the sponsored RIN as compared to the organic RIN Moreover the difference between the in-degree distributions of P and PL products were found to be statistically significant in the sponsored RIN according to students t-test p for battery and p for backpack Further to explore the promotion bias toward Amazon PL products in sponsored RIN we look into the average in-degree of different types of products based on their special relationship with the marketplace Table lists the average in-degree of different types of products in the RINs For the Battery category an Amazon PL is recommended from other items on average in the Organic RIN however in the Sponsored RIN of the same category an Amazon PL is recommended from as many as other items In sharp contrast a P battery product gets recommended from only other items in the Sponsored RIN on average which is actually lower than the average number of items recommending a P battery in the Organic RIN Similarly for the Backpack category Amazon PLs receive recommendations from many more items on average in the Sponsored RIN as compared to the Organic RIN These values clearly suggest that the increase in the degree of promotion of Amazon PL products is significantly higher in Sponsored RINS than that of the P products In other words products that have special relationships with Amazon receive disproportionately more sponsored recommendations than organic recommendations Ranking bias To quantify the ranking bias of the RINs we require a centrality measure of choice and a sensitive attribute To this end we performed our analyses across different choices of network centrality measures For brevity we explain the results for in-degree centrality measure and sensitive attribute based on the PL membership of the products ie whether a product is an Amazon private label PL or a P product In-degree centrality In-degree centrality of a node in a network is the fraction of inward edges coming to it Hence a better rank in this centrality measure suggests that a particular node can be reached with higher likelihood from the rest of the network In the context of RINs better in-degree centrality is synonymous to higher likelihood of customers visibility for products Observations Amazon PLs get significantly better centrality ranks in the sponsored RINs than in the organic RIN In both categories battery and backpack the ranked list obtained from the sponsored RIN ie Rs is almost times as biased as the ranked list from Core Numbers C um ul at iv e D is tr ut io n Sponsored RIN Organic RIN a Core Numbers C um ul at iv e D is tr ut io n Organic RIN Sponsored RIN b Figure of the core numbers of PL products in a battery and b backpack category In general PL products are strategically placed closer to the innermost core in the sponsored RINs the organic RIN Ro Specifically in terms of the normalized discounted KL divergence measure explained in the previous section and respectively for the battery and backpack categories Also in both the battery and backpack categories more than of all Amazon PL products have higher rankings in the Sponsored RIN than their ranking in the Organic RIN Thus the ranked lists obtained from the sponsored RIN Rs shows significant bias by placing Amazon PL products in better ranks Representation in the core of the network In this methodology we calculate the core number of the PL and P products Note that higher core-numbers indicate that the corresponding nodes are located in the inner cores and are hence more strategically placed to derive higher exposure We observe that the PL products heavily occupy the inner cores in the sponsored RIN For the backpack category there are as many as of all Amazon PLs in the innermost core core number of the sponsored RIN in contrast there was no Amazon PL in the innermost core of the organic backpack RIN In case of battery category both the RINs contained of all Amazon PLs in their respective innermost core Further if we divide the cores into four quartiles we observe that in the sponsored RIN of PLs in battery category in backpack category are in the top quartiles ie coreNumber i maxcoreNumbers The percentage reduces to mere in the organic RIN in backpack category Figure shows the cumulative distribution of core numbers of PLs in both RINs of the a battery and b backpack categories The figures show that the Amazon PL products are placed closer to the innermost core in the sponsored RIN to increase their overall visibility as compared to the organic RIN Exposure bias The exposure bias scores bias are computed using the customised Random Surfer model as described in Section The exposure bias scores for both the categories battery and backpack are listed in Table Sponsored recommendations in battery category induce more exposure bias than backpack category We observe that almost items in the backpack category get significantly under-exposed and the percentage rises to in the battery category The overall consequences that such distortions can have on the producers of different items is also worth investigating categories of items bias Battery Backpack Battery Backpack Over Exposed Adequately Exposed Under Exposed Table Percentage of items over adequately and underexposed in the sponsored RIN along with their induced exposure bias in comparison to the organic RIN A m on D ur ac el l P an as on Si

Amazon private label brands highlighted with a rectangle account for nearly and of the total exposure in sponsored RINs in the battery and backpack categories Distortion in exposure of producers brands As stated in Section the exposure of a brand producer is defined as the sum of exposures of all items of that brand We will now analyze the exposures received by various brands Figure a shows the exposure values of the top- brands as per the number of items they have in our battery dataset in both the sponsored and organic RINs A few of the top brands eg Generic Power one Panasonic see a significant drop in exposure in the Sponsored RIN as compared to that in the Organic RIN The drop for the first two brands is more than while for Panasonic it is nearly In contrast the exposure of Amazon PL brands highlighted within a rectangle and Duracell see a significant increase in the sponsored RIN In fact Amazon is the most exposed brand in the sponsored RIN in contrast to Duracell in the organic RIN Alarmingly more than of all P brands were found to be significantly under-exposed in the sponsored RIN Qualitatively similar observations are found in case of backpack category also as shown in Figure b Some of the top brands eg Skybags American Tourister Wildcraft etc see a significant drop in exposure in the sponsored RIN as compared to that in the organic RIN The drop for American Tourister is around while that for the other two brands is more than In contrast the exposure of Amazon PL brands and Cosmus have increased significantly in the sponsored RIN Similar to the observations for the battery category more than of all P brands were found to be under-exposed in the sponsored RIN in the backpack category as well Influence of the sensitive attribute All the analyses reported in this section show that Amazon PL products get much higher exposure via sponsored recommendations Attributes Backpack Battery Organic Sponsored Organic Sponsored Intercept Seller fulfillment PL membership Product quality Product popularity Seller quality Table Attributes along with their estimates as per the NBR model fitted on the dataset inferred from sponsored and organic RIN Seller fulfillment and PL membership attributes have the strongest influence on the in-degree of items indicates p and indicates p than what they get via organic recommendations But we are yet to specifically investigate whether their private label status attribute actually influences their higher exposure in sponsored recommendations To understand the effects of different attributes on the beneficial commodity such as in-degree exposure etc received by items we train a NBR model see Section For our analysis we consider the number of recommendations different items get in-degree of the corresponding items as the dependent variable the beneficial commodity Note that one can take different beneficial treatments or their proxies as the dependent variable For the sake of this experiment we consider it to be the promotion or in-degree of different products The independent attributes we considered are whether the product is a PL or P quality of the product as reflected by the average user rating popularity of the product as defined by the number of ratings whether the seller of an item who won the buy box is a Fulfilled by Amazon FBA or not seller quality as reflected by the average user rating of the seller and seller popularity as reflected by the number of ratings a seller has got The objective is to predict the in-degree of a product given the above attributes and hence to see which attribute most influences the in-degree promotion of items Observations The attributes and their estimated correlation values as output by NBR are listed in Table The seller being an FBA fulfillment attribute has the most significant effect in determining the in-degree of a product in both RINs of the backpack category however for battery category the most significant attribute is the PL membership of the product PL membership is overall the most significant attribute of all in estimating the in-degree of items The estimates of PL membership feature tell an interesting story on the two RINs of the backpack category Being a PL product increases the chance of being recommended a higher number of times in the sponsored RIN estimate while it has a negative estimate on the organic RIN This indicates that in practice customers do not tend to visit the PL backpacks more while surfing for backpacks however the same have been highly promoted in the sponsored RIN Note that among all features the relative importance of PL attribute increases the most when we compare organic to sponsored RIN within the category Among other attributes the quality of the product and that of the seller have positive estimates on the in-degree of products whereas product popularity does not have any positive estimate on the in-degree All the results were found to be statistically significant However in the sponsored RIN their relative importance in comparison to the aforementioned sensitive attributes is very low From this analysis it is clear that being a PL product specifically influences the number of sponsored recommendations received by an item Takeaways from the section We used multiple orthogonal methods and measures to estimate the relative bias toward Amazon PL products Across all the analyses we consistently observe that Amazon PLs are significantly more advantaged in the sponsored recommendations as compared to the organic recommendations Often these advantages for Amazon PL products come at the cost of disadvantages toward other P products CONCLUDING DISCUSSION Our analysis using five different network-based biased measures suggests that Amazon PLs enjoy a significantly high promotion in the sponsored recommendations compared to the organic ie view similarity based recommendations on Amazon Now promotion of private label products is not illegal in fact many tech-giants regularly follow this practice However opaque sponsored private label recommendations can be abused by platforms to systematically evade competition in online marketplaces In turn such policies may have long term economic consequences that affect the livelihood of millions of associated stakeholders We hope our findings would motivate researchers and practitioners to come up with methodologies and/or presentation strategies that would mitigate these biases Toward mitigating exposure bias We believe that one of the best policies to circumvent this problem is to raise the curtain over the black-box algorithms While Amazon has made some efforts in this direction we feel that this is still fragmented and more such efforts should be in place Along with the algorithms some level of transparency in the practices and policies that e-commerce marketplaces follow for placing these sponsored ads might be useful in the long run We understand that there are policy regulations and privacy issues that need to be considered nevertheless such issues can possibly be resolved through proper discussions and appropriate guidelines from the companys legal cell Future directions An immediate next step in this line of work is to explore methods to mitigate the exposure bias without affecting the underlying notions of relatedness among items Note that sponsored results by definition will be different from their organic counterparts However we believe that reasonable arguments can be made for policies that allow sponsored exposure to deviate from organic exposure while thresholding on the extent of such deviation We plan to explore this direction in future Also while in this work we focus on the sponsored recommendations investigation of the Amazon search system would be an important future direction in this line of work
