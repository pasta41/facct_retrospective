An Agent-based Model to Evaluate Interventions on Online Dating Platforms to Decrease Racial Homogamy Perhaps the most controversial questions in the study of online platforms today surround the extent to which platforms can intervene to reduce the societal ills perpetrated on them Up for debate is whether there exist any effective and lasting interventions a platform can adopt to address eg online bullying or if other more far-reaching change is necessary to address such problems Empirical work is critical to addressing such questions But it is also challenging because it is time-consuming expensive and sometimes limited to the questions companies are willing to ask To help focus and inform this empirical work we here propose an agent-based modeling ABM approach As an application we analyze the impact of a set of interventions on a simulated online dating platform on the lack of long-term interracial relationships in an artificial society In the real world a lack of interracial relationships are a critical vehicle through which inequality is maintained Our work shows that many previously hypothesized interventions online dating platforms could take to increase the number of interracial relationships from their website have limited effects and that the effectiveness of any intervention is subject to assumptions about sociocultural structure Further interventions that are effective in increasing diversity in long-term relationships are at odds with platforms profit-oriented goals At a general level the present work shows the value of using an ABM approach to help understand the potential effects and side effects of different interventions that a platform could take CONCEPTS Applied computing Sociology KEYWORDS racism social media dating platforms agent-based modeling INTRODUCTION Online platforms have been criticized for their role in a profusion of societal ills from the increased spread of political misinformation to extrajudicial killings in the Philippines Platforms have sought to address these issues with various interventions from attempts to filter or restrict various forms of content eg hate speech to attempts to decrease discriminatory practices by users Few if any would argue that these interventions have fully addressed the problems at hand Underlying agreement to this high-level assertion however lies a more debated question what are the limits of a platforms ability to intervene on societys ills Given the documented problems platforms have helped give rise to it would be wrong to assume that they have no role to play in positive change At the same time however we must be careful to ascribe too heavy of a causal arrow to platforms Doing so is destined to lead to an ill-informed aura of technological determinism where we search for solutions to societal problems by endlessly tweaking the structure of our technology ignoring other root underlying causes How might we understand the limits to a platforms ability to intervene to reduce a given societal ill Empirical work especially based on natural experiments and using algorithmic auditing is critical but is restricted to studying the platform as it currently exists Exploration of the effects of interventions is thus limited to what platforms are willing and able to implement given their profit-oriented goals Even beyond these profit-related restrictions there are ethical questions about the use of experimentation without the consent of platform users Even still scholars have pursued ethical empirical research not bound by profit-oriented goals for example by constructing platforms of their own But doing so is time-consuming and expensive it would be useful if we could first scope potential solutions and their potential side effects in a more rapid and expansive way Social theory can partially fulfill this role but it can be difficult to theoretically characterize and much less operationalize the myriad causal factors underlying sociotechnical systems What is needed is a methodology that exists in this middle ground between difficult empirical work on the one hand and often abstract theory on the other Simulation has long filled this role of bridging theory and empirical work in the social sciences and more recently has proved useful in the study of algorithmic fairness For example and later use simulation to show concretely how the abstract notion of feedback loops in predictive policing can lead to settings where police unfairly target one population over another despite equal crime rates Simulation has the added benefit of being applied to hypothetical people allowing us to carefully and fully consider the harms that may be caused by a particular intervention before it has any real effects In the present work we use simulation and specifically an agent-based model ABM to make concrete a set of proposed interventions to address a given societal ill on a given online platform and to provide new ideas about their implications and side-effects Online Dating Specifically we construct an ABM of an online dating platform and assess how interventions theorized recently by Hutson et al in their award-winning CSCW paper affect the degree of racial homogamy in a simulated society Racial homogamy is defined as the tendency of individuals to seek out and engage in long-term relationships with individuals who are the same race Critically we do not argue that racial homogamy is in and of itself a societal ill there are many valid reasons why individuals particularly those identifying with an oppressed racial group may want to maintain racial homogamy in their relationships However racial homogamy has been well-established to contribute to the reinforcement of racial inequality by increasing racial segregation and racialized income inequality Hutson et al argue that racial homogamy is hence worthy of dating-platform intervention as it is one racializer of economic and social inequality After detailing this connection between racial homogamy and racial inequality Hutson et al explore an array mechanisms within online dating platforms that present opportunities for interventions to reduce racial homogamy For example search sort and filter tools allow users to perform initial searches for romantic partners and thus might encourage users to make particular decisions about the race of their partner Hutson et al therefore take at least implicitly the stance that platforms could construct interventions that reduce racial homogamy Others however dispute this claim In particular Anderson et al study racial bias in online dating from a sociological perspective and conclude that merely altering the structural environment on the platform say by creating more opportunities for individuals of different races to interact would not necessarily ameliorate persistent patterns of racial homogamy in romantic relationships This claim puts the ideas presented in Anderson et als work in contrast with those presented by Hutson et al who explicitly argue that structural changes to platforms can reduce racial homogamy These two papers therefore present a difference of opinion on the extent to which interventions on online dating platforms can impact racial homogamy and ultimately racial inequality However empirical analyses of this debate is difficult for the reasons listed above We therefore employ a simulation model to bridge the middle ground between Hutson et al theorized interventions and potential future empirical work Our work helps to operationalize the theoretical constructs and to explore their impacts and potentially unintended consequences in an artificial but empirically and theoretically grounded complex sociotechnical system Contributions The present work makes three contributions We provide a blueprint including an open-source modeling framework for the use of agent-based modeling to help operationalize theory and explore the potential impacts of interventions of online platforms Repository link Specific to racial homogamy and online dating platforms we find that various interventions theorized by Hutson et al indeed decrease racial homogamy in our simulated society according to our selected measure by as much as However the benefits of these interventions are dependent on specific assumptions about the sociocultural structure of that society and are often at odds with societal outcomes and profit-oriented goals of the platform Like many social science endeavors our core findings present claims that once stated seem quite obvious However given their motivation from established differences of opinion in published literature by leading scholars our work serves a critical role in the path forward to understanding the potential of platforms to intervene to reduce racial homogamy and as a broader methodology to address similar questions in other domains RELATEDWORK Online Dating Online dating plays an increasingly central role in the process of finding romantic partners with of Americans reporting to have used an online dating site Indeed at least for heterosexual couples online dating has become the predominant means of meeting romantic partners This change in the means for dating has opened the door to a debate on whether platforms can disrupt patterns of assortative mating and in particular decrease racial homogamy While Hutson et al argue that platforms have the means of decreasing racial homogamy through interventions Anderson et al think that this would likely not be the case as homogamy is partly caused by same-race preferences which cannot be changed through opportunity alone These preferences influence and are influenced by social norms and their formation is based on imitation and recurrent behaviour and enforced through social verification To capture this phenomena we consider norms and their impact on preferences In alignment with Hutson et al we acknowledge that platforms can potentially intervene to change norms on the platform so in our model we differentiate between offline and online norms The process people go through while dating online is complex in multiple ways First one goes through a variety of different phases of dating from seeking information about dating platforms to developing a long-term relationship Second the decisionmaking process depends on distinct factors such as the perceived level of compatibility how much we can validly infer about others online and ones own personal stereotypes The complexity of studying dating have naturally given rise to the use of simulations Previous agent-based models for dating have looked at for example how the selection of partners is influenced by space and mobility and whether assortative mating patterns could explain previously observed statistics on marriages and divorce We build upon these examples in our work but focus on the novel problem of understanding the role of platform interventions on racial homogamy in the context of online dating Uses of Simulation to Study Fairness Starting with the seminal work of Schelling on housing segregation simulation has been widely leveraged to explore how inequality and unfairness can arise and be combatted in social systems These studies have provided useful fodder for the more recent application of simulation to questions of algorithmic fairness For example Martin Jr et al use a type of simulation called System Dynamics Modeling to show how simulation can help us to think through the complex impacts of different interventions in the context of credit lending Others have leveraged different kinds of simulation models to study lending in similar ways for example within a reinforcement learning paradigm Still others have used simulation beyond the context of lending For example various forms of simulation have been used to study fairness and feedback loops in the context of predictive policing as noted above the effects of recommender systems and income inequality for drivers on rideshare platforms Like Bokányi and Hannák we use an agent-based model here Agent-based modeling involves the construction of virtual worlds in which artificial agents interact according to a set of pre-specified rules While behavior is thus predictable at the individual level ABMs are useful for understanding how these pre-specified micro-level behaviors result in emergent properties eg social biases across social groups or opinion polarization Our work compliments existing literature using simulation modeling to study questions of fairness and equality in three ways First we study a concrete contemporary and contested question about the role that online dating platforms can play in reducing racial homogamy Second rather than focus on algorithmic fairness specifically we emphasize other ways in which online platforms can have impacts on society Finally and at the same time we develop an agent-based model that can be easily extended to study algorithmic fairness complementing existing System Dynamics and reinforcement learning platforms provided by prior work MODEL Our model contains a variety of parameters listed in Table alongside references where applicable to were used to determine their values Below we first provide an overview of the model and then further details on each major element of the model Model Overview Agents in our model are people that have at some point used our simulated dating website Agents are assumed to carry out a series of activities on the site in pursuit of a romantic partner These activities include creating a profile Figure a searching for a partner b browsing the list of potential partners returned by that search c and messaging d Agents in our model perceive other agents according to their attributes As in most ABMs attributes are just a vector of s and s but are assumed to represent real-world traits that might be important in the context of dating eg partisanship All agents also have a protected attribute that is an attribute relevant to questions about discriminatory dating practices We will focus on race as the protected attribute here Moreover we will focus on a binarized model of race that is agents can be only one of two races in the model In the context of prior work we discuss above the two races of interest here are White and Black Section provides full details on how agents are modeled a Creating a profile b Searching using filters c Browsing the filtered list of potential partners d Looking at and potentially responding to messages Figure The actions agents can take on the platform As shown in Figure relationships between agents evolve over a series of phases from finding or being found by a potential partner to interacting with each other on the platform via messages online relationship and finally to an offline relationship At any phase a relationship might end at which point the agents will resume their search for another romantic partner or exit the platform If a relationship continues for long enough it becomes a long-term relationship Our primary outcome measures focus on racial homogamy in these long-term relationships and Section provides complete details on the different relationships phases The simulation is carried out via a sequence of iterations or turns with one turn being loosely the equivalent of one day On the first turn of the simulation agents are initialized and become the population of users on the online dating site On each subsequent turn we add four new agents modeling a constant flow of new users After new agents are added all agents get a turn to act During their turn agents can conduct a search potentially using a set of search filters provided by the site send a message start a new relationship continue or end an existing relationship or leave the platform either because they have found a long-term partner or because they have become frustrated with the site As shown in Figure which of these things agents decide to do is based on which part on the relationship phase they are in and on the decision model we construct for agents The decisions made by an agent are determined by their attributes the attributes of their potential or current partner the stereotypes they hold of how different attributes are related and their preferences for others with certain attributes These preferences are themselves informed by social norms that exist both on and off the platform Section provides details on how agents make decisions Exiting the platform Too many unsuccessful searches Too many relationships fail Enter a long-term relationship Message reply or pass Phase Search Phase Offline Relationship Update preferences knowledge stereotypes Phase Online Relationship Continue Relationship Update preferences knowledge stereotypes Moves to next phase if messages exchanged Relationship ends agent wants to stay on platform Search results Moves to next phase after several turns Exits platform into long-term relationship Relationship ends agent wants to leave platform Continue Relationship Figure Overview of relationship phases and transitions in each turn of an iteration explained through the blue agents choices and actions Quote boxes represent decisions the blue agent makes and the vectors represent the agents attributes or the blue agents knowledge of potential partners attributes Table Tabular description of model parameters Left and the values taken in the virtual experiment Right For parameters with a red-coloured value we simulate each value for all simulated interventions but keep the values of the other parameters to red values see Section Parameters Values Taken Varied in Virtual Experiment Tolerance to un-successful search turns Out-platform norms for protected attributes Strength of updates norms Initial degree of ethnocentrism Correlations in attribute generation Fixed in Virtual Experiment Strength of updates interaction Strength of updates average norms Relative importance of out-platform norms when generating initial preferences Failure tolerance to unsuccessful relationships initial acquaintances in-group out-group Weight of searchable vs experiential attributes Pr searchable attribute specified on profile Pr learning searchable experiential attributes rounds until offline long-term Pr to meet while offline Pr to consider a message while in search Maximum agents considered in a search turn iterations Initial population size agents added per iteration Agents attributes are static in our model However their stereotypes and preferences evolve as they interact with others and move through relationship phases The social norms governing all agents also evolve throughout the simulation Section details when and how these updates to stereotypes preferences and norms occur Agents As in all ABMs our agents have state and can take actions Agents states encompass their type attributes stereotypes preferences and knowledge of others The actions agents take based on these states are a set of decisions which we describe in Section Type Agents can be of two types and are only attracted to agents of the opposite type We thus loosely mimic a hetero- and mono-normative online dating website as was studied by Anderson et al We return to this limitation in our conclusion Agents are assigned to the two modeled types with equal probability Attributes Each agent has a vector of binary attributes We distinguish between race and other attributes Following theory in the online dating literature we make two additional distinctions among attributes First we distinguish between matching and competing attributes For matching attributes agents try to find partners with similar values while for the competing attributes they try to find partners with the highest possible values We assume that the protected attribute is matching Second we distinguish between attributes visible only offline as experiential attributes and ones that are visible both online and offline as searchable attributes Examples of searchable attributes include personal interests and location Sense of humor is an example of experiential attribute Since people do not share everything about themselves in their profiles agents have a probability of to specify each searchable attribute on the platform In the example from Figure the agent chose to specify their music taste but not their race We describe the complete process of generating attributes for new agents in the Supplementary Materials Stereotypes Agents stereotypes encompass their beliefs of which attribute combinations are more likely to be encountered We model the stereotypes of agent as a matrix This matrix is initialized via a theoretically grounded model that is also based on prior work Specifically when generating a new agent we first generate a sample of agents having the same race and agents with a different race The imbalance in sample sizes is motivated by homophily people are in general more likely to meet and know people similar to themselves In addition to homophily we also model in-group favoritism ie that people tend to look favorably on people like them To capture this in our model we follow prior agent-based models and assume that agents also have an initial degree of ethnocentrism For example as in if the degree of ethnocentrism is then the agent will on average expect of the attributes of agents in the other-race sample to have values that the agent does not like The Supplementary Materials contain full details on stereotype initialization and Section on how stereotypes evolve over time Preferences An agents preferences define which attributes they believe are most important in a potential partner We model the preferences of agent as a weight vector This vector of preferences is in the simplex ie its entries sum to one thus capturing the relative importance of different attributes in the eyes of the agent For example a weight vector with and all other entries of corresponds to an agent who only considers the attribute to be important in a potential partner The preferences of agents influence and are influenced by two different types of social norms ie sociocultural regulations on ones preferences First while interacting online an agent impacts and is impacted by platform norms Second when in an offline relationship the agent preferences inform and are informed by off-platform norms Critically then in our model as in the real world agents preferences thus vary in part based on social norms which change as they move between the context of the platform and their offline social life At the same time norms are aggregations of the preferences of individuals except as we will discuss when explicit efforts are made by the platform to fix norms Agent preferences are initialized based on a procedure common in the decision-making literature We note here that two parameters govern important aspects of this process First a parameter is used to capture the level of correlation between race and other attributes Second captures the level of correlation between the non-protected attributes Varying these two parameters changes the predictability of one attribute given another In our virtual experiment both and are changed Most importantly is varied to reflect different degrees to which race can be inferred by agents based on other available attributes when the agent chooses not to display race in their online profile Knowledge of other agents As they interact with another agent agents can become aware of the values of new attributes of that agent This knowledge is used to make decisions about eg whether to continue relationships How agents acquire this knowledge is discussed in Section Relationship Phases Agents can be in one of three relationship phases searching in an online relationship or in an offline relationship Searching phase When first entering the platform an agent is in the searching phase An agent can search in two ways First the agent can perform a query for potential partners using a search interface Second the agent can look through messages in their inbox that they have received from other agents In one turn of the simulation agents can perform up to search actions mimicking the typical length of a users session on an online dating website A search action represents looking at either a single search We discuss initialization of preferences and norms in the supplementary material We make the simplifying assumption that an agent can only be in one of the beforementioned phases at one time eg one cannot be both searching and dating offline result or a single message in the agents inbox The agent randomly decides which of these two actions to take If the agent decides to view a profile from their search result list they look at the profile of the next search result and decide whether or not they should send that person a message If the agent decides to view a message in their inbox they look at the oldest un-read message and consider whether or not they should reply Search results are a randomly ordered subset of other agents currently on the platform Importantly however the agent decides which other agents will appear in their search results They do so by filtering for potential dating partners The agent filters on a single attribute the one that on this turn is most important to them ie for agent the attribute with the highest value In Figure for example interest in music is the most important factor for the blue agent and they hence use this as a filter The blue agent is then only shown profiles of other agents having a passion for music If the agent decides to reply to a message in their inbox their search ends and the two agents involved proceed to an online relationship phase However the agent can send as many initial messages to agents in their search results as they would like An unsuccessful search is considered to be a turn in which the agent is not interested in answering any of the messages they have looked at and in which they did not find at least half of the profiles theyve looked at interesting enough to send an initial message Too many unsuccessful search turns would make the agent exit the platform Online relationship phase After answering or getting a reply to an initial message the agent moves to an Online Relationship Phase with another agent While in this phase in each iteration the two agents within the relationship have an online interaction During this interaction three things happen First agents may update their knowledge about the attributes of the other Going back to the example in Figures and when entering the relationship the blue agent only knows the value of the green agents interest in music After one interaction they have also learned the self-identified race of the green agent Second agents update their stereotypes based on what they learn about the other see Section Finally agents decide whether or not to continue the relationship If both decide to continue the interaction is positive and the relationship will continue with a new interaction in the next iteration Otherwise the interaction is negative and the relationship ends After deciding on whether or not to continue the relationship the preferences of agents are updated based on whether the interaction was positive or negative see Section and the turn of the agents ends If the agents have decided to end the relationship their tolerance to failed relationships decreases Agents will exit the platform if this tolerance reaches and otherwise they return to searching If the agents decide to continue the relationship they either continue the online relationship or if the relationship has lasted long enough move to the Offline Relationship Phase Offline relationship phase The turn of an agent in an Offline Relationship Phase progresses similarly to the Online one with two key differences First if the interaction was positive the agents either continue the relationship as above however if the relationship lasts for iterations the agents then exit the platform into a long-term relationship Second while offline in each iteration there is a fixed chance of interacting This means that in expectation people in offline relationships meet once per week Agent Decision-Making In the Searching phase agents answer the questions posed to themselves should I reply to/send an initial message to this agent When in a relationship the agent answers questions of the type should I continue being in a relationship with this agent Both of these are yes/no questions and agents use the same decision function described below to answer them Suppose that agent must make a decision about sending a message or continuing a relationship with agent We assume agent may know only an incomplete vector of agent s attributes which we call We use if extends the incomplete vector of attributes ie is a complete vector that has the same entries as on the known attributes Lastly for the agents there is some time value capturing the amount of time spent in that specific phase with one another for somebody in the searching phase or who just started an online or an offline relationship In making decisions agents consider a the time spent so far with the other agent and b how well the attributes of the other agent align with their own attributes and preferences Time is an important predictor for breakups as agents that have stayed longer in a relationship are less likely to interrupt their relationship For example people tend to be especially selective in their first offline date together Consequently using the above introduced notation the probability that agent answers yes to a decision question regarding agent is given by the following sigmoid function E Two aspects of the above equation require further explanation First the expected value is taken over all possible attribute combinations extending the incomplete information of over the attributes of The probability of each combination is given by the current stereotypes of Thus stereotypes impact what they expect the unknown attributes of to be Second the function is an attribute scoring function that for a given agent and complete attribute vector returns a vector with entries and depending on whether each attribute is viewed as good neutral or bad Agents see a matching attribute value as being good if it is the same as their own and bad if it is different Similarly they see a competing attribute value as good if it is larger than their own neutral if it is equal and bad if it is lower The Supplementary Material provides a formalization of this scoring function Belief Preferences and Norm Updates Agents stereotypes preferences and the norms of the platform change on each iteration Agent Stereotype Updates Recall that when generating an agent we construct a sample of attribute combinations they have encountered so far After each interaction an agent observes a new combination of attributes If that observation is a complete list of attributes they add it to the sample Otherwise they find the probabilities of each possible complete combination of attributes that could extend the observed one and adds a proportional fraction to each of these categories For example consider somebody that observes the combination after an interaction and their sample was observations for and for Post interaction their sample changes to and Norm and Preference Updates Preferences and on-platform norms both change during each iteration First agent preferences change according to their interactions based on a whether the interaction was positive or negative and b the attributes of agents For example a positive interaction with somebody of the same race will change the preference of the agent by increasing the preference of an agent to date someone of the same race In contrast a negative interaction with someone of the same race will make the agent less likely to seek out a same-race partner in the future At the end of each simulation turn norms and preferences are updated to reflect their convergence Specifically the on-platform norm gets closer to the average preference of agents on the platform and the preferences of agents are updated by getting closer to the respective norm Each update is carried out by taking convex combinations between the original value of the norms preferences and the values of the influencing preferences norms The extent to which norms determine preferences and vice versa is set via model parameters See the supplementary information for more details on how these updates are made as well as details on initialization VIRTUAL EXPERIMENT We now describe how we use our model to explore three different classes of interventions outlined by Hutson et al In Section we operationalize these interventions which are also listed in Table We then discuss how we vary model parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions under different assumptions about the underlying society Finally we detail the outcome measures we use to understand the impacts of these interventions Interventions Hutson et al suggest three places where platforms might intervene to reduce bias and discrimination on intimate platforms at the search sort and filter level at the matching algorithm level and at the community policy and messaging level Here we focus on the first and the last and leave out the second for two reasons First not all platforms use matching algorithms and even when they do the algorithm differs substantially Second the literature on the possible algorithm to implement is vast Consequently there are many different alternatives to substitute the existing matching algorithm with A comparison between these various procedures is beyond the scope of this paper Filtering Interventions The ease of filtering out people based on their attributes when searching for potential partners in online systems may exacerbate racial homogamy in two ways it reduces the diversity in search results and it makes race a legitimate basis for decisions The first suggested solution to mitigate this problem by Hutson et al is to purposefully introduce diversity into search results eg by removing the ability to filter by certain attributes entirely We refer to any intervention along these lines as a filter intervention We consider four different filter interventions comparing them to a baseline of traditional platform behaviors Table The three types of Interventions the baselines for each and the different intervention conditions we test Intervention Description Filtering Interventions Strong Baseline Only see others with the preferred attribute value on the most important attribute Strong non-race Strong filtering if not on race Otherwise Strong filter on second most important Weak Also shows profiles with unknown values on most important attribute Weak non-race Weak filtering but not on Race Off No filtering allowed Attribute Intervention attributes Each agent has the protected attribute plus one of each kind of attribute attributes Each agent has the protected attribute plus two of each kind of attribute Norm Intervention Off Baseline On-platform norms are an average of agent preferences On On-platform norms are fixed to on race encouraging agents not to consider it As explained above without any intervention agents will filter their searches for romantic partners by the attribute they consider to be most important We refer to this baseline option as Strong filtering From this baseline Hutson et al note that interventions to reduce racial homogamy can be constructed along two dimensions First we can restrict the possibility of filtering on race entirely To signal such an intervention we add a non-race label to the filter name Second we can introduce diversity by showing profiles of agents who did not provide the given attribute in their profile We label filtering strategies that only include the desired setting of the given attribute as Strong and those that also include potential partners who simply do not fill out a value for this attribute as Weak Combining interventions on these two dimensions gives three more filtering options namely Strong non-race Weak and Weak non-race We also add a fourth intervention where no filtering is allowed at all on any attribute ie the Off filtering option The five filtering conditions are most clearly stated with an example Consider the agents in Figure Let us assume the platform opts to use Strong filtering Further let us assume that the blue agents strongest preference is for a romantic partner that is the same race In this case the blue agent will search for others with the same race and will see only other potential partners who publicly self-identified with that race on the platform If the platform had Weak filtering the agent would also see any other agents who a have the same self-identified race or b do not specify any race on the platform If the platform employed Strong non-race filtering the platform would not allow the agent to search by race at all The agent would therefore use their second strongest preference say music to perform their search Weak non-race follows similarly and in the Off condition agents would simply not be able to filter at all Finally note that we have described the process with a matching attribute for competing attributes agents are always assumed to search for other agents who hold the desired attribute Attribute Intervention Removing filtering options can make it harder for agents to find the partners they desire A suggested solution by Hutson et al to mitigate this problem is to add or give additional attention to new non-race attributes on which agents can filter eg political view or smoking preferences We refer to this intervention as an Attribute Intervention In our model this intervention is implemented by increasing the number of dating-relevant attributes from a baseline of to a total of ie from having one non-racial attribute of each type to having two of them Norm Intervention The final intervention from Hutson et al that we model are attempts to change or outline platform norms Hutson et al suggest that different community policies such as introducing pledges educating users on the effect of expressing racial preferences and detailing the disparities faced by racial minorities can encourage social norms to date interracially Norms in turn are known to be perhaps the most powerful mechanism for changing discriminatory behaviors In our experiment the platform norm intervention fixes the value of the on-platform norm for the race attribute to This means that agents via the link between norms and agent preferences are encouraged not to consider race at all in their decisions Differently from the baseline condition when on-platform norms are updated to reflect the average of preferences the value on the race dimension does not change and continues to be see the Supplemental Material Assumptions about Society Table lists the model parameters we vary or keep constant in our virtual experiment As we will show consideration of these parameters is critical to understanding how well claims about intervention effects generalize to different assumptions about society At the same time a full exploration of the parameter space is infeasible We take a three-pronged approach to addressing this First as noted in the table many of these parameter and their values are theoretically grounded and/or empirically informed by prior work Second we engaged in sensitivity testing described in the appendix across a range of values for all parameters Finally for our virtual experiment we fixed parameters that did not appear to have significant impacts on model outcomes For parameters that did appear to have an effect we select a default value for each coloured in red in Table when varying one such parameter we keep the others at their default values As shown in Table we vary five model parameters in our simulation First tolerance to unsuccessful search turns which allows us to see how results change if agents are more or less tolerant to seeing undesired profiles and messages while browsing Second we vary racial bias in the out-platform norms capturing how much importance society puts on same-race relationships compared to the other attributes of individuals Third we vary the influence norms have on preferences ie the percentage of individual preferences explained by social norms Fourth we alter the initial degree of ethnocentrism which intuitively corresponds to the extent to which agents are likely to prefer same-race relationships The last As a reminder attributes differ along two dimensions matching-competing and searchable-experiential thus giving possible types Note also that Hutson et al additionally suggest a variant of this intervention namely one based on the minimal group paradigm in social psychology We provide results for this similar intervention in the supplemental material parameters we change are the levels of correlation between attributes ie and we test in turn scenarios with zero low mild and high correlations between race and the other attributes and low and medium correlations between the other non-race attributes Each simulation runs over iterations which corresponds roughly to a period of over years Moreover we use distinct random seeds for each scenario thus having a total of runs Outcomes We treat racial heterogamy the opposite of racial homogamy as the main outcome variable when studying the impact of the simulated interventions on racial homogamy We operationalize racial heterogamy as the percentage of long-term relationships that are interracial However a proportion-based measurement can of course vary based on changes in the numerator or denominator Thus an increase in racial heterogamy might be caused by a decrease in efficiency ie the overall number of long-term relationships or an increase in the number of interracial relationships We therefore investigate these two quantities separately as well Lastly we provide two measures of user satisfaction which are important for two reasons First profit-oriented decisions by platforms depend in part on the number and hence also on the happiness of users This in turn suggests platforms may be less likely to implement interventions which threaten these metrics Second even if a platform was somehow persuaded to implement such interventions the free nature of the market permits unsatisfied users to easily move to a different dating platform To capture user satisfaction we use two measures informed by literature on online dating First we measure the percentage of time spent in an offline relationship relative to online dating phases Second we measure the number of users who exit the platform because they have exhausted their tolerance for unsuccessful online searches RESULTS Average Effects on Racial Heterogamy Each intervention proposed by increases racial heterogamy However as shown in Figure the magnitude of these effects vary The largest positive effect of any intervention is the Strong non-race filtering condition ie when our simulated platform removes the option of filtering searches by race but allows agents to search on all other attributes Doing so increases racial heterogamy from to In contrast a Weak filtering option increases the percentage by over the baseline Combining the Strong non-race filtering intervention with the norm and attribute interventions further increase racial heterogamy However the effects are non-additive For example the effect of the norm intervention decreases after implementing a filtering intervention Applying the norm intervention to the baseline filtering option results in a increase in interracial relationships while if it is applied on top of a Strong non-race intervention the impact reduces to less than Finally adding dating-relevant attributes produces an additional and relatively stable increase of to These results suggest the potential of interventions on the platform but also that their impacts may quickly reach a saturation point We do so since we would like to emphasize the positive nature of the proposed change Figure Racial heterogamy y-axis given a particular filter intervention x-axis and depending on whether or not the norm intervention is On green lines as points or Off blue lines triangles as points and whether or not the attribute intervention is off left subplot or on right subplot Effects on Total Number of Relationships We also find that increases in racial heterogamy the percent of long term interracial relationships are not solely due to an increase in the number of interracial long-term relationships Rather as depicted in the first part of Figure most interventions are also paired with a significant decrease in the overall number of long-term relationships With respect to the filtering interventions removing the ability to filter by race causes an almost drop in the total number of long-term relationships This happens in short because agents and people often want to filter by race whether they are conscious of that fact or not Thus removing this filter makes it harder to find partners that agents desire The attribute intervention causes this decrease for a separate non-obvious reason Specifically including additional attributes makes the search space becomes more diverse thus making it harder to find the right partner Most obviously with more attributes the chance of two agents matching on all attributes decreases Finally with respect to the norm intervention influencing the preferences of agents by changing on-platform norms produces fluctuating evaluation criteria especially when paired with racially biased offline norms Agents enter the simulation with their own potentially racially-biased preferences As they interact on the platform their preferences slowly converge towards the racially unbiased on-platform norm However when going through the offline relationship phase their preferences again adapt to the racially biased societal offline norms thus shifting the evaluation criteria of agents again These fluctuations means it takes longer to find suitable partners so if the process extends over the tolerance of agents for either bad recommendations or failed relationships they will exit the platform without entering a long-term relationship In our model as in modern cultural sociological theory then the impact of the norm intervention is therefore contingent on the extent to which norms within the context of the platform permeate to other normative context by way of individual preferences Effects on User Satisfaction Our simulations suggest that most interventions on average will decrease user satisfaction especially filter interventions that do not Figure Number of total left and interracial right long-term relationships y-axis for the filter conditions x-axis and the norm intervention Blue off Green on Results are only shown without the attribute intervention allow users to filter on race However the magnitude and in select cases even the sign of these effects vary according to the settings of the other interventions and across the two metrics considered These findings present evidence that interventions can potentially be carried out without decreasing user satisfaction but that these interventions typically are weaker in terms of reducing racial homogamy that effects on one satisfaction metric may contradict results on another and that which combinations of interventions are most effective is not obvious a priori Specifically Figure a shows that filtering interventions to varying degrees all decrease the percentage of agents time spent in offline relationships and in doing so likely decrease user satisfaction The most drastic impacts are from the Strong non-race intervention where of agents time is spent offline as opposed to in the baseline condition This effect is however mitigated when paired with the attribute intervention This is likely because agents become more satisfied with the non-race filtering options they have available to them Other interventions while less capable of reducing racial homogamy than the Strong non-race filter have a much more limited effect on user satisfaction These observations for time spent offline also appear when measuring user satisfaction in term of the percentage of users who leave the platform without a partner As shown in Figure however certain filter interventions can actually increase user satisfaction along this metric Specifically the use of Weak or no filtering can increase satisfaction on this metric because agents often do not report all of their attributes and thus including also the profiles with unknown attribute-values lowers the chance of excluding possibly interesting partners Full descriptions of other patterns in Figures a and are included in the Supplemental Material Intervention Impacts under Different Assumptions about Society Finally we explore how interventions fare under different assumptions about society Broadly speaking we find as reflected in Figure that interventions do have strong stand-alone beneficial effects but that their impact is diluted if certain often reasonable assumptions about society are met The figure shows coefficients resulting from a linear regression with racial heterogamy as the outcome variable and all centered a The percentage of time spent in offline relationships b The percentage of exits due to exhausting the tolerance for

variables For readability Figure only includes the coefficients with the strongest absolute effect The regression model fits the data quite well indicating that first- and second-order effects explain much of the dynamics of the complex system we model but also that the model cannot be fully explained by phenomenon enumerable by theory alone Filter interventions have the largest absolute effect on racial heterogamy On average across all simulated societies removing the possibility to filter by race increases racial heterogamy by See the Supplementary Material for full results of the first-order effects The Norm intervention also has a considerable positive impact as it alone induces an average increase of The impact of these interventions reflects their potential to have real and possibly lasting changes on society Not all interventions we tested however increase racial homogamy in the manner theorized by Hutson et al Specifically we find that only matching as opposed to competing and searchable as opposed to experiential attributes produce a meaningful increase in racial heterogamy Adding other types of attributes can actually have negative effects either in decreasing overall numbers of relationships while not impacting the number of interracial relationships or in simply leading to a decrease in racial heterogamy These findings underscore the importance of using simulation to think through the operationalization of potential interventions especially by combining various theoretical models here of intervention and attribute types into a single simulation model Other results in Figure show unsurprisingly that different assumptions about society reflect drastically different baselines from which this improvement might come For example we see that racial heterogamy is significantly reduced as correlations between race and the other attributes increase and with an increase in racial bias in off-platform norms Perhaps most importantly however Figure reveals that intervention effects and societal conditions can interact to change the effectiveness of an intervention For example the Norm intervention is particularly effective when we make the assumption that agent preferences are strongly impacted by social norms But adding a non-race filtering option is less effective with increased values of the parameter Put another way the effectiveness of not allowing individuals to search by race on an online platform is limited by the extent to which race is signaled by or correlated with other attributes that the platform does allow one to search on CONCLUSION In their recent articles Hutson et al and Anderson et al present contrasting views on the extent to which online dating platforms can intervene to impact long-term patterns of racial homogamy in online dating In the present work we developed an agent-based modeling approach that synthesizes modern perspectives in cultural sociology the psychology of online dating and social computing to help us explore this debate Before discussing the implications of our work we again explicitly call out two critical assumptions that our model makes While we allow race to co-vary with other individual attributes reflecting its multidimensional nature our virtual experiment does ultimately assume that race and gender are both binary ie that one can easily and completely specify an individuals race or gender Doing so lends an aura of racial and gender determinism to our work that FAccT scholars are rightfully skeptical of Our experiment also assumes that these variables are independent and thus ignores important intersectional identities However we emphasize that these assumptions are made only in the present virtual experiment and are by no means hard-coded into our open Note that confidence intervals are provided here but should be cautiously interpreted as they can be made infinitely small simply by running additional simulations See the Supplement for full results source simulation framework We hope that we and others can therefore easily explore other constructions of race dating gender and sexual preference in future work These limitations in mind our findings shed critical light on the effectiveness and side effects of the interventions proposed by Hutson et al in reducing racial homogamy and ultimately racial inequality Our work implies that the extent to which these interventions will be effective depends on four things First it depends on what we assume about society We find that some of the proposed assumptions are effective only if we assume that people are unable to infer perceived race from other cultural preferences along which race can be performed online an assumption that is potentially untenable given what is known about correlations between cultural attributes in general and perceptions of race in particular And other interventions are effective only if we assume that the platform can significantly impact social norms towards interracial dating on their site and that these norms have more significant effects on individuals than other offline normative structures eg the family that have historically encouraged racial homogamy Second it depends on what platforms and society are willing to accept as sacrifice for progress on racial homogamy Our model makes explicit these potentially non-obvious tradeoffs quantifying how certain interventions to reduce racial homogamy have negative impacts on user satisfaction and rates of overall long-term relationships Third it depends on how long one is willing to wait We find that changing on platform norms have a limited effect however our model only studies short-term effects Changes in large-scale social norms can take much longer and thus the payoff of these normative interventions may exist only much further into the future as on-platform norms influence agent preferences which in turn slowly reshape norms in other contexts Finally it depends on what ones ultimate goal is If ones ultimate goal is to increase racial homogamy to any degree our results provide evidence that this is possible under a fairly wide range of assumptions However if ones goal is to eradicate racial homogamy then interventions at the platform level seem to hit a saturation point well below true equality These technological interventions will therefore almost certainly never be enough they must be supplemented with structural and normative social change beyond the platform While one could argue that these findings are post-hoc somewhat obvious our work is motivated by a disagreement in the existing literature over the potential for platform intervention This should serve as an important reminder that everything is obvious once it is observed and we hope motivates the use of our approach to other domains Especially when unsuitable changes could have large negative effects constructing a model and simulating different possible outcomes could help explore potential problems to those interventions that emerge within a complex sociotechnical system
