Documenting Computer Vision Datasets An Invitation to Reflexive Data Practices In industrial computer vision discretionary decisions surrounding the production of image training data remain widely undocumented Recent research taking issue with such opacity has proposed standardized processes for dataset documentation In this paper we expand this space of inquiry through fieldwork at two data processing companies and thirty interviews with data workers and computer vision practitioners We identify four key issues that hinder the documentation of image datasets and the effective retrieval of production contexts Finally we propose reflexivity understood as a collective consideration of social and intellectual factors that lead to praxis as a necessary precondition for documentation Reflexive documentation can help to expose the contexts relations routines and power structures that shape data CONCEPTS Human-centered computing Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing Social and professional topics Quality assurance Computing industry Computing methodologies Computer vision problems KEYWORDS datasheets for datasets dataset documentation reflexivity data annotation training data transparency accountability audits machine learning INTRODUCTION Since the rise of deep learning and convolution neural nets the field of computer vision has demonstrated some of the most impressive results in machine learning Reaching a new high in popularity computer vision models are used in a broad range of applications penetrating ever more aspects of daily life Creating datasets for computer vision is not straightforward Work practices involved in gathering annotating and cleaning image data comprise subjective choices and discretionary decision-making Such decisions range from the framing of real-world questions as computational problems to the establishment of taxonomies to label images Data is also the product of unequal social relations that are present among data workers as well as in the relationship between those whose data is collected and those who make use of data for research and/or profit The opacity of industrial practices regarding computer vision datasets is a significant threat to ethical data work and intelligible systems Recent research has proposed implementing structured disclosure documents to accompany machine learning datasets Despite their good intentions those efforts fail to effectively reflect power dynamics and their effects on data For instance Gebru et al propose that datasheets include the question does the dataset identify any subpopulations eg by race age or gender This way of documenting dataset composition is helpful However we argue that disclosing if a dataset includes racial categories does not speak to the problem of such categories reductiveness nor makes the assumptions behind race classifications embedded in datasets explicit In the same way asking who created this dataset and who was involved in the data collection process and how were they compensated remains insufficient to interrogate hierarchies in industrial settings and their effects on data Reflecting on interests preconceptions and power encoded in training data is essential for addressing many of the ethical concerns surrounding computer vision products In this paper we lay our focus at the intersection of manual data processing and computer vision engineering We investigate how work practices involved in the production of computer vision datasets can be made explicit in documentation Although data processing can cover a variety of activities we refer to companies where human workers collect segment and label image training data Data processing companies of this kind provide data services at the request of computer vision companies hereinafter requesters that wish to outsource parts of dataset production Work between service providers and requesters requires strong coordination efforts as it comprises many actors and iterations Collaboration is informed by negotiation over the meanings that are ascribed to images In this context not all actors hold equal power to shape datasets Data processing companies generally collect and interpret data according to categories instructed by requesters and workers often trust the judgment of their managers in case of doubt or disagreement These dynamics have a crucial effect on the datasets that train commercial computer vision products Making them explicit in documentation can help better understand models behavior and uncover broader ethical issues We base our investigation on fieldwork at two data processing companies and several interviews with data collectors annotators managers and computer vision practitioners We identify key aspects of the effective documentation of responsibilities decision-making and power asymmetries that decisively shape image datasets Our investigation is framed by the following research questions How can the specific contexts that inform the production of image datasets be made explicit in documentation Which factors hinder documentation in this space How can documentation be incentivized Given the complex interweaving of actors iteration and responsibilities involved documenting the context of data transformations is crucial yet hard to achieve We propose reflexivity understood as the consideration of social and intellectual factors that predetermine and shape praxis as a crucial component for retrieving and documenting power dynamics in data creation We borrow Bourdieus Invitation to Reflexive Sociology and translate it into an invitation to reflexive data practices Our invitation regards reflexivity not as personal introspection but as a collective and collaborative endeavor We start by reviewing work that investigates the documentation of machine learning datasets and models Then we explore different conceptualizations of reflexivity After offering an overview of research methods informants and fieldwork sites we present our findings These are organized around four salient documentation-related issues emerging from our analysis namely the variety of actors involved and the collaboration among them the different purposes and forms of documentation the perception of documentation as burden and problems around the intelligibility of documentation Next we discuss the implications of our findings and propose the implementation of reflexivity in disclosure documents Finally we introduce and discuss four motivations which could lead companies to implement reflexivity-driven documentation namely preservation of knowledge inter-organizational accountability auditability and regulatory intervention RELATEDWORK Documentation of Datasets and Models Previous work has pointed at the need for opening black-box algorithms by explicating their outcomes and documenting their modeling A growing body of literature has investigated and developed structured disclosure documents or checklists for artificial intelligence models and services which document their intended uses testing methodologies and outcomes actors involved possible bias and ethical problems While these disclosure documents primarily focus on AI models and services information relevant to training datasets is also required to be reported Recent research has called for applying similar structured procedures for documenting datasets specifically This line of research advocates for and applies the systematic documentation of datasets purpose composition collection process preprocessing uses distribution and maintenance Several studies also draw special attention to the documentation of actors involved including their characteristics and roles the use of software and other tools availability of training and additional resources for documentation and fair pay for workers Furthermore ethical concerns have been raised in documentation regarding privacy and potential harms of datasets see Table Most prominently Gebru et al argue that documentation can improve transparency accountability and reproducibility and facilitate the communication between dataset consumers and producers They propose that every dataset be accompanied by a checklist which should be flexible enough to accommodate specific domains and existing organizational infrastructure and workflows Holland et al argue that documentation of datasets can enable consumers to select appropriate datasets better and at the same time improve data collection practices among dataset creators as they would need to explain and justify their practices They propose a dataset nutrition label that is composed of modules to be filled in through a combination of manual work and automated procedures Geiger et al focus primarily on documentation of datasets in academic settings They maintain that documentation not only contributes to increasing reproducibility and open science but is also a matter of research validity and integrity Whereas current proposals and practices of documentation often prioritize reproducibility power imbalances in contexts of data creation are not often accounted for In their investigation of data annotation services Miceli et al present evidence of how power asymmetries shape computer vision datasets In particular the authors show how the judgements of managers and even more of requesters remain unquestioned when it comes to interpreting and labeling data In view of these dynamics DIgnazio and Klein underline the importance of restoring the context where datasets are produced be it social cultural historical institutional or material and the identities of dataset creators They explain that one feminist strategy for considering context is to consider the cooking process that produces raw data and propose asking who questions to drive reflection and analysis on power and privilege In line with this research we highlight the importance of looking into processes of data creation and foster disclosure documents that go beyond datasets technical features We argue that the dimensions proposed or applied in structured dataset documentation formats see Table are necessary but insufficient to drive a much-needed reflection of industry practitioners and researchers position and influence on data For such a reflection to be possible datasets must be placed in the context of their production This perspective would not only provide a better understanding of datasets functional limitations but can also make power asymmetries in data settings visible Table Summary of descriptive dimensions in documentation frameworks proposed or applied in previous research It should be noted that the dimensions are often interconnected and not mutually exclusive Authors Proposed or Applied Documentation Form Descriptive Dimensions in Documentation Gebru et al Datasheets Geiger et al manual and technology-assisted documentation Bender and Friedman Data statements Holland et al Dataset Nutrition Label Seck et al Datasheets Choi et al Datasheets Description of datasets motivation private or public single use or open dataset Description of actors involved eg funding providers data workers data subjects and so on Description of datasets composition Description of datasets collection process Account of data pre-processing steps eg cleaning labeling Description of datasets intended and recommended uses Description of datasets distribution Description of datasets maintenance Description of software and other tools used in data work Reflection on potential impacts and ethical issues relevant to datasets Description of training for data workers Formal definitions and instructions for annotation Payment for workers Team composition and diversity Account for production settings and hierarchies Procedures for solving discrepencies in data production Rationale for data collection framing and labeling taxonomies The Notion of Reflexivity According to DIgnazio Klein reflexivity is a precondition for restoring context in data creation The authors define reflexivity as the ability to reflect on and take responsibility for ones own position within the multiple intersecting dimensions of the matrix of domination The matrix of domination is a concept first termed by Patricia Hill Collins to explain how systems of power are configured and experienced Black feminist scholars and critical race theorists have given considerable attention to the importance of ones positionality with regard to race gender and class in scientific practice The work of Dorothy Smith Patricia Hill Collins and Sandra Harding in standpoint theory is an important strand in this space Researchers in critical race theory further interrogate ideological positioning of privileged and dominant groups More broadly scholars on positionality frame actors positions in socio-political contexts and scrutinize researchers personal identities and stances concerning the contexts of knowledge and study These positions shape researchers view of the world and thereby the whole research process ie how they perceive construct and approach a research problem how they report research findings and the process of knowledge construction and production Previous investigations in sociotechnical systems have introduced reflexivity by drawing experiences and methodologies from other disciplines to examine presumptions and taken-for-granted practices in machine learning and data science Viewing machine learning via computational ethnography Elish and boyd underline the situated nature of knowledge work and argue in favor of methodological reflections and reflexive practices Drawing on critical race methodologies and operationalization of race in other disciplines Hanna and Denton et al argue that the widespread conception and operationalization of race in algorithmic systems as a fixed attribute is decontextualized and therefore problematic Previous work has furthermore argued that machine learning systems have positionality Among other factors they inherit positionality from data Preconceptions and values get embedded in data for instance through collection and analysis methods and through the taxonomies used in data annotation The sensemaking and classification of data through labels as performed by annotators is a judgement and as such informed by the knowledge experiences perspectives and value commitments of annotators or labelers As we will explain in Discussion Pierre Bourdieus conceptualization of reflexivity understood as a relational construct and an integral part of inquiry praxis is at the core of the documentation framework we present in this paper Bourdieus writings on reflexivity offer a systematic investigation into social and intellectual factors that predetermine and shape researchers practices in scientific work The Bourdieusian notion of reflexivity goes beyond personal experiences and regards researchers position at the collective level that is in relation to other actors and the field of inquiry as a whole Moreover Bourdieus reflexivity does not aim to undermine objectivity Instead it is presented as an analytical tool to sensitize researchers to the social and intellectual unconscious that condition their thoughts and practices in research and is therefore an integral part of and a necessary prerequisite for scientific inquiry The French sociologist pinpoints three types of bias that may influence scientific research which may be mitigated by introducing reflexivity The first bias results from researchers positions in the social structure such as class gender and ethnicity The second bias comes from researchers position in academic disciplines ie academic traditions prevailing currents and socio-organizational structures in specific disciplines that determine specific field epistemologies The third bias termed by Bourdieu as the intellectualist bias is embedded in the scholarly gaze that places researchers outside or above the object of research and considers their engagement with problems as purely scientific and unconstrained from social positions and economic interests In opposition to this idea Bourdieu argues that researchers are participants rather than external observers and restores research practices as knowledge-producing activities rather than pure and disinterested investigations In the Discussion section we will come back to this notion of reflexivity The three Bourdieusian levels of bias will be the base to discuss why reflexivity is fundamental for documenting data practices Reflexivity to make individual and collective positions explicit and acknowledge their effects on data is not only crucial for conducting better science as Bourdieu argues It could also help researchers and practitioners uncover broader ethical issues in computer vision systems METHOD Data Collection This investigation was organized around two phases involving different yet related research foci and methods Documentation practices are a critical aspect we investigated at both stages In the first phase we focused on work practices in data processing companies where human workers collect segment and label image training data We conducted ethnographic fieldwork at two data processing companies of the impact sourcing sector located in Buenos Aires Argentina and Sofia Bulgaria Impact sourcing refers to a special type of business outsourcing processing company that intentionally employs workers from marginalized communities As described on their websites and confirmed by our observations the Argentine company employs young people living in slums while the Bulgarian organization works with refugees from the Middle East The Buenos Aires-located company that we will call Emérita is a medium-sized organization With branches in three Latin American countries Emérita conducts projects in data annotation content moderation and software testing Its clients are large regional corporations in diverse fields such as security e-commerce and energy At the time of the observations between May and June the Buenos Aires branch of Emérita had around data-related employees who mostly worked hours shifts Mondays to Fridays and were paid at the minimum wage Action Data is the code-name of the Bulgarian company Action Data specializes in image data collection segmentation and labeling Its clients are computer vision companies mostly located in North America and western Europe The company offers its workers contractor-based work and the possibility to complete their assignments remotely with flexible hours Contractors are paid per picture or annotation and payment varies according to each project and its difficulty At the time of the observations in July the Bulgarian company was very small in size Three employees in salaried positions and a pool of around contractors handled operations At both sites we conducted several weeks of observations with different levels of interaction and involvement All tasks observed were related to the production of datasets for computer vision and requested by computer vision companies Moreover we observed the on-boarding briefing and further training of workers as well as instances of communication between managers and teams and managers and requesters It is important to mention that the observations were primary conducted with a different research question in mind and focused on general work practices and not specifically on documentation However the exploratory character of the method and the rich interactions observed allowed us to extract useful insights for this investigation that were later corroborated by our interview partners In addition to the observations fieldwork at both sites also consisted of intensively interviewing data collectors annotators and management In total we conducted sixteen in-depth interviews with an average length of minutes face-to-face at both locations Informants were aged to Eleven of them identified as female and four as male None of them had received an education in tech-related fields or had technical knowledge prior to their current employment At Emérita in Argentina we conducted five in-depth interviews with data workers and employees in managerial positions At Action Data we conducted eleven in-depth interviews with workers and managers Interview partners were asked to choose code names to preserve their identity and that of related informants The interviews included accounts of specific work situations involving the interpretation of data the communication with managers and clients and the documentation of responsibilities and decisions Moreover the interviews covered task descriptions general views on the company and the work informants professional and educational background expectations for the future and biographical details The second phase of this investigation dealt with the role of stakeholders at the opposite end of the service relationship namely the computer vision companies requesting data processing services At fieldwork we observed that requesters have a major influence on the documentation practice of data processing companies and decided to pursue this line of inquiry Through expert interviews with computer vision engineers data quality analysts and managers we investigated how task instructions are formulated and communicated to data processing workers and how this process is documented The interviews revolved around the object purpose and responsibilities of documentation Moreover we discussed issues and possible solutions for implementing broader forms of documentation in industrial contexts at the intersection of data processing and computer vision We conducted a total of fourteen expert interviews Four informants were managers with large data processing companies located in Kenya India and Iraq In addition six expert interviews were conducted with computer vision practitioners working on products including an aesthetics model that sorts and rates personal image libraries a scanner that detects contamination on hands and optical sorting equipment for the classification of waste The computer vision practitioners work for companies located in Germany Spain and the United States Finally four of the interviews conducted at Emérita and Action Data revolved almost exclusively around the role of requesters in documentation and were framed as expert interviews While the goal of in-depth interviews is revealing practices and perceptions the purpose of expert interviews is to obtain additional professional assessments on the research topic The sampled interview partners were considered experts because they were able to provide unique insights into widespread routines and practices in their and other companies With an average length of minutes and conducted face-to-face or remotely the expert interviews allowed us to contextualize some of the practices observed at fieldwork and analyze to what extent observations could be generalized to other settings Data Analysis For the analysis we integrated field notes with a total of thirty interview transcriptions and used constructivist grounded theory principles to code and interpret the data We conducted phases of open axial and selective coding and let the categories emerge from the data We applied a set of premises to make links between categories visible and make them explicit in our research documentation and in open discussions among three coders We constantly compared the collected data to revise our emergent understanding or find additional evidence of observed phenomena Four salient axial dimensions identified during the analysis process constitute the base for the findings we present in the following section FINDINGS As stated in Introduction this paper explores three research questions How can the specific contexts that inform the production of image datasets be made explicit in documentation Which factors hinder documentation in this space How can documentation be incentivized Our findings unpack documentation practices at the intersection of data collection data annotation and computer vision engineering Through descriptions and interview excerpts we describe salient dimensions emerging from our data actors and collaboration documentation purpose documentation as burden and intelligibility of documentation These four dimensions reveal scenarios that should be taken into account for creating effective documentation procedures that are based on workers needs and possibilities Actors and Collaboration Our first research question inquires about ways of making the specific production contexts of image datasets explicit in documentation In this section we take a first step towards unpacking by describing the characteristics of such production contexts The creation of computer vision datasets requires the collaboration of actors that often work in different organizations At the intersection of data collection data annotation and computer vision engineering not every actor has the same influence on data Power differentials become evident when deciding which data to collect how to classify it and how to label it Many datasets are produced with a specific computer vision product in mind Dataset design begins as the expected outcome of that product in terms of computational output but also of revenue is transformed into task instructions for data collectors and annotators A typical assignments is illustrated by a data collection project of Active Data the company received task instructions to collect images of diverse human faces from a Western European company producing identification and verification systems Eva the founder of Active Data offered more details They were interested in a diversity of five different ethnicities so Caucasian African Middle Eastern Latin American and Asian Of course very debatable whether these can be the five categories that can classify people around the world This type of assignment generally revolves around a clients envisioned computer vision product and underlying business idea The technical assumptions of a classification system demand mutually exclusive categories in this case even for a problematic concept such as race Whether such categorisation captures the realities of data subjects or coincides with the values and believes of data workers is not negotiated Written instructions formulated by the requester are passed along to project managers who brief workers Workers then start collecting the images For outsourcing companies the rationale behind data-related decisions is doing what the client ordered and offering value to the client Conversely the rationale shaping datasets in computer vision companies is data needs to fit the model and data processing should be fast cost-efficient and high-quality Power differentials between service providers and requesters become even more evident given that the data processing companies participating in this investigation are located in developing countries while their clients are in the Global North In view of such asymmetries decisions about what to document and the financial means to do so largely depend on the most powerful actors Anna an intern working at Action Data and in charge of auditing the company and conducting an impact assessment concisely described these dynamics Q What do you think are the potential drivers or reasons for the implementation of the more transparent approach to documenting systems and processes A If the customer demands it Q Is this something you have heard before customers demanding a more A No Moreover computer vision companies often regard some of the information that could or should be documented as confidential especially if it involves details about the intended product or if some of the processes involved in producing the dataset are considered a strategic advantage Given the collaborative nature of data creation one stakeholders opacity may affect others inclination towards transparency As Active Datas founder Eva and several others of our informants described secrecy in computer vision hinders her companys attempts to document work processes Its also a small challenge of how to preserve some of the know-how throughout the different projects without of course revealing too much about the different processes that each client has you know the confidential information from each project In many cases this issue leads to reluctance to share existing documentation with other stakeholders and the general public or to not document at all Documentation Purpose The reasons for documenting the production of datasets and the forms of documentation vary with each organization To start considering ways of incentivizing documentation we first must look into common needs and goals that different stakeholders may have in relation to disclosure documents In this sense we have identified four common documentation purposes preservation of knowledge improvement of work practices accountability and disclosure of datasets specifications All data processing companies participating in this investigation carry out some form of project documentation In a more or less structured way companies document task instructions provided by clients Instructions may change as projects develop or workers might develop new practices according to clients feedback Soo is a project manager at the Kenyan branch of a large data processing company During our interview he explained how this form of documentation can help improve existing processes and practices We have a lessons learned- folder where we put all these items Like the client has said You did not do well here Well find in our process there was this flaw We will document that And then what happens after we document is that information is stored to be used for that project and some future projects with the same kind of process work The preservation of this form of praxis-based knowledge is crucial because it helps organizations resolve doubts that might emerge train future workers and apply situated solutions to future projects Similarly documentation can also serve to revise and improve work practices and flows as further described by Soo How can we improve this process This did not go well What was the issue How did we solve it How can we avoid this in future And you will get information for a project that was done five years ago The documentation helps us in making sure that we avoid repeating the same mistakes And also it helps us in looking for better ways of doing the work how to measure where it is possible and also what other process we can improve like in the process flow Given the differentials of power described in the previous section documentation is many times perceived as useful for accountability between outsourcers and requeters Several informants working at data processing companies highlight the importance of preserving task instructions and documenting changes instructed by clients Keeping this type of record might serve as proof that tasks were carried out as instructed In the next interview excerpt the founder of Active Data describes how documentation might help resolve discrepancies if clients are not satisfied with the quality of the service provided or decide to demand more We also keep the client accountable so that they dont come up with a new requirement or something that we havent mentioned before So SoWs scope of work documents are also for accountability of us towards the client as well so that the client can have a document where they can keep track of what the arrangement is and so on beyond our contract However accountability within teams can become surveillance for workers several informants account for the connection between project documentation and the measurement of workers performance in data processing companies The Argentine company Emérita directs great efforts to measure workers performance and output quality and to transform those into numbers and charts Nati Eméritas continuous improvement analyst described this process Within the project documentation we have an external person who checks if the work the team did is right or wrong then documents the percentage of right and wrong If something is wrong we fix it before the client notices But still even when it is fixed we record that there was something that was wrong and record who was responsible for the mistake Finally in the case of datasets for public use or without a preestablished purpose organizations might find it important to document and disclose datasets specifications This particular case was reported by our informants at Action Data as the company had recently released two datasets for public use During an interview Eva contemplated the possibility of releasing a disclosure document along with the datasets It might be nice to implement some type of documentation at least for them datasets for open use because theyre for external use and it might be good to know what the origin of the images are what the process of annotation had been and so on It is worth mentioning that releasing datasets for public use is usually not within the scope of outsourcing companies Investing resources to produce a pro-bono dataset represents a considerable effort for these companies In the case of Active Data the dataset was made publicly available as part of the companys marketing strategy Documentation as Burden Relevant to start unpacking factors that hinder documentation is the fact that several informants see documentation as time-consuming extra work that is likely to delay the completion of workers actual tasks This is a widespread view among the computer vision practitioners interviewed for this investigation and coincides with the observation that among the different roles explored in this study computer vision companies seem to be the least inclined to document work practices Lack of time is the most widespread answer when informants are asked why there are not more aspects of data creation reflected in reports Documentation is broadly perceived as optional a nice-to-have feature that is implemented only once all important issues are sorted Andre a US-based computer vision engineer with a startup dedicated to producing scanners that detect contamination on hands described his companys position on this issue Documenting is lower on our priority list than a bunch of other things that we need to do Its just not the companys priority at this moment There are other more valuable things to keep the company successful As the engineering team grows as we have more time to do those things and our work to meet the companys exact needs are less burdensome then wed go to more documentation Among our informants in computer vision companies the view persists that documentation is an activity only large corporations can afford As further reported by Andre start-up teams are smaller and workers are multitasking which reinforces the view that there are more pressing issues than documentation Thats one of the interesting things about start-ups You dont have the time to document everything There is a lot of knowledge in every single person here that would take far too long to pull out of them and transfer to a new person and keep the company still running at the same time A similar observation was made by Eva the founder of the Bulgarian data processing company regarding her companys clients Weve been working with quite a lot of new companies recently Some of them are bigger corporations that have more lets say bureaucratic procedures and more detailed processes of description of everything thats happening around the project while others are just start-ups that prefer very lightweight minimum involvement and paperwork around their projects Lack of incentives external or internal is another reason why documentation might be perceived as a burden For instance some informants agreed that laws and regulations would be an excellent external incentive for technology companies to integrate documentation as a constitutive part of their work In the absence of regulations documentation is seen as optional extra work As for internal incentives within organizations several computer vision practitioners explained that documenting was not a part of their work routines and was therefore not encouraged by the companys structures Emmanuel a computer vision engineer based in Barcelona and working on optical sorting equipment for wastes classification discussed the need for integrating documentation in existing workflows He moreover imagines that extending projects deadlines to prioritize documentation would not be seen as acceptable within his companys culture Time is a huge issue I mean I think planning is very important get the time to do it documenting and that everybody knows this is supposed to be done Because right now documenting is not a task and I dont know that I would have a gap between projects so I could document And this is never a priority for the company they expect me to meet my deadlines I cant just drop my deadlines to document And this is a problem If documenting was part of the deadline companies wouldnt just leave it for another time Even in companies that integrate laborious documentation in their work processes as is the case of Emérita there are instances where documenting is just not profitable Nati one of our informants with the Argentine data processing company describes one of those situations It happens sometimes that we do one-time projects that go only for one or two weeks In those cases documentation is a waste of time and money because the client buys lets say eighty hours and you spend twenty documenting Its just not profitable As expected financial incentives or the lack thereof can also influence views on documentation Intelligibility of Documentation To further investigate factors that hinder documentation it is necessary to explore issues around creating compelling retrievable and intelligible disclosure documents To illustrate some relevant aspects related to structuring and providing access to documentation we draw on the observations made during fieldwork at both data processing companies Emérita and Active Data Both companies have vast experience in the documentation of data collection and annotation projects In the case of the Argentine company Emérita due to the extension of documentation and the large number of projects conducted navigating and maintaining disclosure documents has become difficult Nati a continuous improvement analyst is in charge of addressing this issue What happened a lot was that information was repeated in many places The objectives were written in three different documents The people who were in the project were in two different systems So having that repeated was horrible because every time people in the team changed well you needed to update many things and credentials Nati works on optimizing some of her companys internal processes including documentation For that purpose she has surveyed project documents observed how the company teams work and discussed with them how documentation can be improved Her main focus lies in producing documentation that can be easily retrieved and used which can be very challenging For example in the case of project guides it was not clear what documentation had to be done so everyone did what they wanted or what they remembered or what they knew because someone told them and when information was needed they didnt know if it had been documented or not or they didnt know where to find it We lost a lot of information like this Further issues related to the intelligibility of documentation may arise depending on who is in charge of documenting and who are the users of documentation In the case of Active Data the Bulgarian company working with refugees from the Middle East language and lack of technical knowledge is one of those issues Since were working with people who very frequently do not have high levels of education or do not speak good English Ive heard a lot of complaints that people are not reading the training documents or theyre not following them or theyre asking questions that appear or are already answered in the training documents So it can be quite frustrating because people may not be used to following such documentation and they might need additional training just to know how to use this recommendation how to read it and how to follow it Creating useful reports that can be easily retrieved and understood is challenging How disclosure documents are created indexed and stored depends to a greater extent on the intended addressees of documentation As illustrated by the previous interview excerpt language is important if stakeholders with different levels of literacy will make use of documentation DISCUSSION As described in Findings work at the intersection of data collection annotation and computer vision engineering requires strong coordination efforts among actors that occupy different social positions Documentation purpose organizational priorities and needs around documentation intelligibility vary across stakeholders In such heterogeneous contexts some actors hold more power than others and decisions made at the most powerful end will inevitably affect work practices and outputs at every level These power differentials and their effects are broadly naturalized Despite their decisive effects on data decisions and instructions that are rooted in such naturalized power imbalances are mostly perceived as self-evident and remain undocumented as a consequence Previous research has emphasized the importance of documenting machine learning datasets While we acknowledge that work for creating the foundations for our investigation we also argue that the frameworks proposed are not sufficient to interrogate power differentials and naturalized preconceptions encoded in data With our investigation we move the focus away from documenting datasets technical features and highlight the importance of accounting for production contexts Our research questions address the challenge of documenting production processes that are characterized by the multiplicity of actors needs and decision-making power In this and the following sections we lay out implications of our observations and outline a documentation framework to address the contexts and issues described in Findings Given the collaborative nature of datasets production we argue that documentation should not be carried out in the vacuum of each organization The framework we propose regards dataset documentation as a collaborative project involving all actors participating in the production chain This is not easy for sure To address such challenge we propose that reflexivity understood as a collective endeavor be an integral part of such collaborative documentation As argued by Bourdieu this form of collective reflexivity accounts for actors social position and aims to interrogate praxis fields and the relations that constitute them In a similar manner reflexive documentation should help to make visible the interpersonal and inter-organizational relations that shape datasets As described in the Related Work section Bourdieus notion of reflexivity covers three levels of hidden presupposition the researchers social position the epistemology of each disciplinary field and the intellectualist bias described as the scholarly gaze researchers use to analyze the social world as if they were not part of it We take this perspective and transform Bourdieus Invitation to Reflexive Sociology into an invitation to reflexive data practices What constitutes our invitation entails much more than observing how one actors positionality affects data If documentation is to be seen as a collaborative project reflexivity of work practices should be understood as a collective endeavor where widespread assumptions field methodologies and power relations are interrogated With this framework we regard documentation in a two-fold manner First as an artifact the resulting documentation that enables permanent exchange among stakeholders participating in data creation We envision disclosure documents that travel among actors and organizations across cultural social and professional boundaries and are able to ease communication and promote inter-organizational accountability Second we regard documentation as a set of reflexive practices the act of documenting intended to make naturalized preconceptions and routines explicit Just as Bourdieu regards reflexivity as a necessary prerequisite for scientific inquiry the reflexive practices involved in our documentation framework should be seen as a constitutive part of data work If reflexivity is only regarded as a desirable goal related to AI ethics and not as actual part of the job documentation will never be considered a priority and as described in Findings it will continue to be perceived as a burden Why Reflexivity Our research questions enquire about ways of making the contexts that inform the production of image datasets explict in documentation and about factors that hinder or incentivize the implementation of documentation in industry settings In view of our findings we argue that effective documentation should be able to reflect the dynamics of power and negotiation shaping datasets through work practices However making visible the hierarchies worldviews and interests driving decisions and instructions is extremely challenging One major difficulty lies in their taken-for-grantedness documenting naturalized power dynamics and decisions that are largely perceived as self-evident require intensive reflexive practice The three previously-mentioned levels of reflexivity proposed by Bourdieu social position field epistemology and intellectualist gaze can be useful to discuss why reflexivity should be at the core of documentation practices in data creation for computer vision They provide an additional lens through which data practices can be approached and as such serve as a complement to on-going work and discussions regarding the documentation of datasets First reflexive documentation should consider the social position of workers involved in dataset production not just individually but in their relation to other stakeholders Such consideration could help produce documentation that brings power imbalances into light and questions taken-for-granted instructions and hierarchies This relational examination is especially important due to the widespread use of outsourced services for the collection and annotation of data Workers at crowdsourcing platforms are subject to precarious employment conditions In the impact sourcing companies presented in this paper workers come from marginalized communities refugees in Active Data slum residents in Emérita Most of them have no technical education How does their social position affect these workers ability and power to question the instructions commanded by computer vision engineers or data scientists in tech companies This question becomes even more pressing if we examine the relationship that connects data processing services in developing countries with computer vision companies in the Global North Documentation frameworks that are oblivious to the fact that production chains are shaped by asymmetrical relationships will never be effective in reflecting how those asymmetries affect data In this sense reflexive documentation should bring power differentials to light and ideally empower those in vulnerable positions to speak up and raise questions Second reflexive documentation should serve to question field epistemologies Examining the epistemology of computer vision might shed light on the assumptions methods and framings underlying the production of image datasets As Crawford and Paglen argue computer vision is built on a foundation of unsubstantiated and unstable epistemological and metaphysical assumptions about the nature of images labels categorization and representation Bringing these assumptions forward in documentation is important because socially-constructed categories such as race and gender are generally presented as indisputable in image datasets Furthermore a fixed and universal nature is not only ascribed to the categories as such but also to the correspondence that supposedly exists between images and categories appearances and essences Reflexivity should help reveal the political work such assumptions perform behind their purely technical appearance Finally reflexive documentation should help practitioners question the intellectualist gaze in data work This type of bias is the inclination to place ourselves outside the object of research This form of examination would highlight the role of workers and organizations in creating data while questioning widespread notions such as raw data and ground truth labels Reflexivity should therefore help to adopt a relational view on data and data work acknowledging data as a human-influenced entity that is shaped by individual discretion inter-organizational routines and power dynamics Why Document Data processing services and computer vision companies might be reluctant to implement such an elaborate approach to documentation Our third research question asks how can documentation be incentivized In this section we consider four ways in which the Bourdieusian framework previously outlined can constitute an asset for organizations and thus serve as an incentive for the uptake of reflexive documentation Preservation of Knowledge Reflexive documentation could make praxis-based and situated decision-making explicit and help preserve it in documentation This knowledge can become long term business assets for companies Moreover reflexive documentation can preserve know-how relevant to data work that may get lost due to workers flow As the flow of workers brings about problems in task transfer and reinvestment in training new employees documentation that preserves knowledge and methods for effective data work be they project-specific or not can ease the transition Furthermore documentation can have analytical value and improve communication in interdisciplinary teams The framework offered in this paper highlights the collective nature of reflexivity We argue that documentation that preserves praxis-based knowledge and best practices as described in section should be circulated among collaborating companies rather than be produced and retrieved in the vacuum of each organization For one thing sharing such documentation with other stakeholders may improve the quality of data work and of the datasets that are produced as a result For another documentation providing more details on discretionary decision-making and its contexts can enhance transparency and facilitate a better understanding of datasets before model development Inter-organizational accountability Tracking decisions and responsibilities in environments and processes that involve multiple organizations can be challenging As described in Findings data processing companies use documentation to foster inter-organizational accountability and protect themselves in the face of disagreements with clients At the same time computer vision companies might consider documentation as a tool to keep track of the processing status of projects and audit requested tasks Reflexive documentation could be especially useful to improve traceability as the participation of many actors and iterations in data creation may lead to accountability dilution Moreover documentation could provide organizational infrastructure that empowers individual advocates among workers to raise concerns and reduces the social costs for such actions An infrastructure based on the reflexivity framework outlined in this paper could facilitate the interrogation of intra- and inter-organizational relations normative assumptions and workflows shaping data at the three levels described in the previous section Conducting documentation at a collaborative level which means to engage various actors and to accommodate documentation to their needs can serve as a platform for permanent exchange among stakeholders Enabling permanent exchange could help anticipate disagreements and misunderstandings thus improving task quality and reducing completion time Auditability Documentation based on reflexivity could constitute an asset for organizations to prevent issues before they are made public or weather the storm in the face of PR failures Disclosure documents that are able to retrieve the context of dataset production could constitute a useful tool for auditability for instance when computer vision outputs are publicly questioned or for internal ethics teams who would like to perform an assessment for potential fairness concerns prior to the release of a model trained on such data Such documents could help to identify problematic issues before they become public pushbacks Moreover in case of public failures documentation could provide an audit trail that would allow organizations to address problems and offer solutions promptly In this sense public pressure could constitute an incentive for companies towards documentation In such cases counting with reflexive documentation to audit datasets could help companies offer solutions that go beyond throwing in more data and are able to address issues at the three Bourdieusian levels previously described identifying asymmetrical relationships that might have been encoded in datasets interrogating widespread assumptions in computer vision and questioning data even raw data Regulatory Intervention Organizations could also be pushed towards documentation through regulatory intervention Yet before any form of reflection including the documentation thereof can be imposed a few observations can be made First while documentation might be considered an important component or step of the reflexive process it is neither constitutive to nor sufficient for reflection Reflexivity represents a state of awareness an encouragement for actors involved in data creation to more widely consider the impact of their practices Reflexivity can already be valuable in itself The policy end-goal is therefore to stimulate a reflexive mindset and to establish the right conditions for such a mindset to fully come to fruition Conversely if regulation only aims at pushing documentation the danger exists that such regulatory requirements are approached as merely an administrative exercise towards compliance Second if the encouragement of reflexivity through legal means would be desired such mechanisms may already be partially present in existing initiatives For instance it could be argued that the EU General Data Protection Regulations increased emphasis on accountability and risk-based responsibility stimulates some level of reflection where personal data are involved Reflexivity could moreover become an additional supportive tool for data workers as a means to detect and mitigate the impact data actions have on fundamental rights and as such contribute towards the compliance with existing legal frameworks Third given the multiplicity of actors involved in data creation regulatory initiatives should also carefully consider the actors they wish to target Stakeholders should not only be targeted in isolation instead policy makers should understand the relationships these actors hold vis-a-vis one another and the consequences that their relationships bear on the activities performed Finally any regulatory response must adequately consider the power asymmetries described in this paper including their manifestation within a globalized international environment Mechanisms of provenance such as documentation could help ensure and demonstrate that societal values and fundamental rights as well as an appropriate level of reflexivity have been maintained throughout the computer vision value chain rather than purposefully avoided via outsourcing strategies and/or the exercise of power Similarly provenance may increase the accountability and responsibility of powerful entities in both their actions and their given instructions LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK This investigation was designed to be qualitative and exploratory Our findings are bound to the specific contexts of the companies and individuals participating in our studies and cannot be generalized to all computer vision production settings In the future we seek to broaden this research by investigating ways of integrating the framework outlined in this paper in real-world production workflows and co-designing actionable guidelines for reflexive documentation together with industry practitioners CONCLUSION Based on fieldwork at two data processing companies and interviews with data collectors annotators managers quality assurance analysts and computer vision practitioners we described widespread documentation practices and presented observations related to the purpose challenges and intelligibility of documentation In view of these findings we proposed a reflexivity-based approach for the documentation of datasets with a special focus on the context of their production We described documentation as a set of reflexive practices and an artifact that enables permanent exchange among actors and organizations We argued that disclosure documents should travel across organizational boundaries and be able to ease communication and foster inter-organizational accountability We imagined documentation as a collaborative project and argued that reflexivity of work practices should therefore be understood as a collective endeavor where not only personal positions but also praxis fields are interrogated Achieving a healthy balance between these elements and incentivizing practitioners and organizations to implement reflexive documentation is not easy The challenge is nevertheless worth exploring if we aim at addressing some of the ethical issues related to the production of data for computer vision systems
