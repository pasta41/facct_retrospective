Operationalizing Framing to Support Multiperspective Recommendations of Opinion Pieces Diversity in personalized news recommender systems is often defined as dissimilarity and operationalized based on topic diversity eg corona versus farmers strike Diversity in news media however is understood as multiperspectivity eg different opinions on corona measures and arguably a key responsibility of the press in a democratic society While viewpoint diversity is often considered synonymous with source diversity in communication science domain in this paper we take a computational view We operationalize the notion of framing adopted from communication science We apply this notion to a re-ranking of topic-relevant recommended lists to form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method Our offline evaluation indicates that the proposed method is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists according to a diversity metric from literature In an online study on the Blendle platform a Dutch news aggregator with more than users we found that users are willing to consume viewpoint diverse news recommendations We also found that presentation characteristics significantly influence the reading behaviour of diverse recommendations These results suggest that future research on presentation aspects of recommendations can be just as important as novel viewpoint diversification methods to truly achieve multiperspectivity in online news environments CONCEPTS Information systems Recommender systems Human-centered computingUser studies Empirical studies in HCI KEYWORDS recommender systems viewpoint diversity framing aspects INTRODUCTION In recent years traditional news sources are increasingly using online news platforms to distribute their content Digital-born news websites and news aggregators which combine content from various sources in one service are also gaining ground In of survey respondents reported online media as their primary news source and considered digital and traditional sources equally relevant This change also induces a wide adoption of news recommender systems that automatically provide personalized news recommendations to users Communication studies acknowledge two important roles of media in a democratic society to inform citizens about important societal and political issues and to foster a diverse public sphere Both roles are then related to multiple social-cultural objectives of democracy such as informed decision-making cultural pluralism and citizens welfare The role of news recommender systems in promoting these democratic values is under heavy discussion in academic debate For example filter bubbles received increasing awareness suggesting that high levels of personalisation would lock people up people in bubbles of what they already know or think According to Helberger the democratic role of news recommender systems mainly depends on the democratic theory that is being followed such as liberal participatory or deliberative Thus the development of viewpoint diversification methods can be in particular motivated in relation to the participatory and deliberative model Current diversification methods however do not address viewpoint diversity but define diversity as dissimilarity or topic diversity eg corona versus farmers strike Therefore current diversification methods are not applicable in the news domain and novel viewpoint diversification methods are needed to maintain and assure multiperspectivity in online news environments Moreover to truly enable multiperspectivity users should be willing to consume viewpoint-diverse recommendations Their behaviour should be studied in real online scenarios to ensure that diversification criteria does not damage the adoption of the recommended items and thus lead to the total rejection of the news recommender platform Thus we investigate the following research questions R How is reading behaviour affected by viewpoint diverse news recommendations R How is reading behaviour affected by presentation characteristics of viewpoint diverse news recommendations To answer these questions we propose a re-ranking approach for lists of recommended articles based on aspects of news frames a concept taken from communication studies In particular a news frame describes how to identify a view on an issue in a given article Thus by bridging aspects from the social and the computational domains we aim to overcome the current gap between the definition of diversity in recommender systems and news media During an offline evaluation the proposed method increased the viewpoint diversity of recommended lists of news articles on several topics Further we measured the influence of the viewpoint diversification method on the reading behaviour of more than users which are likely to interact with the recommended articles in an online study on the Blendle platform a Dutch news aggregator We found that reading behaviour of users that received diverse recommendations was comparable with the reading behaviour of users that received news articles optimized only for relevance However we did find a positive influence of two presentation characteristics on the click-through rate of recommendations news articles with thumbnails and news articles with more hearts are read more often Therefore we make the following contributions a novel method for viewpoint diversification using re-ranking of news recommendation lists based on framing aspects an online evaluation with more than users on the Blendle platform to understand a how viewpoint-diverse recommendations affect the reading behaviour of users and b how articles presentation characteristics affect the reading behaviour of users RELATEDWORK In this section we first investigate how communication science understands diversity Then we review current approaches for diversity in recommender systems This allow us to bridge the gap between the domains of communication and computer science by operationalizing framing aspects in a diversification algorithm Diversity in News Media In news media diversity refers to multiperspectivity or diversity of viewpoints In communication science diversity is in general a key measure for news quality thus fostering democratic aspects such as informed decision-making cultural pluralism and citizens welfare Two main approaches to assess diversity can be distinguished source and content diversity with most studies focusing on source diversity When measuring source diversity most methods follow Bennett s indexing theory which assumes that including non-official or non-elite sources corresponds to high levels of diversity Alternatively Napoli approaches the issue as a policymaker and distinguishes three aspects of source diversity content ownership ownership of media outlets and the workforce within individual media outlets Critics however state that multiple sources can still foster the same point of view and therefore source diversity is not a direct measure for viewpoint diversity Multiple studies also indicate that power distributions in society commercial pressure of news media and journalistic norms and practices significantly influence which sources gain media access Therefore it is often argued that viewpoint diversity can only be achieved by fostering content diversity Content diversity is defined in as heterogeneity of media content in terms of one or more specified characteristics Baden and Springer identified six common approaches to assess content diversity The first three methods focus on the tone or political position represented in the news ie the inclusion of non-official positions the diversity of political tone These methods however assume that political disagreement equals viewpoint diversity Another approach uses language diversity to evaluate content diversity However this is again no direct measure since different language can describe the same perspective The final two approaches assess content diversity by means of frames Framing theory states that every communicative message selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the complex reality Thereby frames enable different interpretations of the same issue Porto states that news environments need to be evaluated by their ability to provide diverse frames Baden and Springer describe three frames aspects central to the role of viewpoint diversity in democratic media First frames create different interpretations of the same issue by selecting some aspects of the complex reality Second frames are not neutral but suggest specific evaluations and courses of actions that serve some purpose better than other Third frames are often strategically constructed to advocate particular political views and agendas Framing thus can be a suitable conceptualization of viewpoint diversity Diversity in Recommender Systems Traditionally research on recommender systems focused on evaluating their performance in terms of accuracy Such focus however induced a problem which is known as over-fitting eg a model is fitted so strongly to a user that it is unable to detect any other interests Additionally there is a need for more user-centric evaluations of recommender systems Thus diversity has become one of the most prominent beyond-accuracy metrics for recommender systems In this context diversity is generally defined as the opposite of similarity and it is often based on topic diversity eg corona versus farmers strike For example Ziegler et al proposed a topic diversification method based in the intra-list diversity metric Current diversification methods for recommender systems thus do not focus on viewpoint diversity and are not applicable in the news domain To the best of our knowledge only one study for viewpoint diversification has been proposed so far They propose a new distance measure for viewpoint diversity based on linguistic representations of news articles This diversity measure was then applied in a post-processing re-ranking algorithm to a list of news articles These allowed optimizing for the balance between topic relevance and viewpoint diversity In a small scale user study readers indicated a lower intent to consume diversified content motivating the need to study behavioural measures for newsreaders on a larger scale Thus we argue that more research is required to understand the relationship between the metric and the influence on readers behaviour In this work we bridge the current gap between the notion of framing in communication science and computational approaches Additionally we study how viewpoint diversification affects newsreaders behaviour in an applied setting The next section justifies the operationalization of framing in the computational domain FRAMING FOR VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY Framing is an extensively researched concept in different domains including psychology communication and sociology having its roots in the latter domain Bateson states that communication only gets meaning in its context and by the way the message is constructed Later frame theory gained increasing momentum and was generally understood as follows every communicative message selectively emphasizes certain aspects of a complex reality Thus every news article unintentionally comprises some form of framing Frames are often deliberately used to construct strategic often political views on a topic Consequently frames enable different interpretations of the same issue However every frame inevitably deselects other equally plausible and relevant frame When considering frames in news articles multiple definitions exist However the definition of Entman is the most commonly adopted in the literature It states that framing includes the selection of some aspects of perceived reality and make the more salient in a communicating text in such a way as to promote a particular definition of a problem causal interpretation moral evaluation and treatment recommendation for the item described Within this definition the problem describes four framing functions Problem Definition what a causal agent is doing with what costs and benefits eg a second Coronavirus wave is approaching Causal Attribution identifying the forces creating the problem eg it is due to the government policy response Moral Evaluation evaluate causal agents and their effects eg response to approaching second wave came too late negative evaluation Treatment Recommendation offer and justify treatments for the problems and predict their likely effects eg there must be predefined measures to be deployed at a critical threshold of virus spread Frames can be found at different levels of analysis including single sentences paragraphs or articles as a whole A frame however may not necessarily include all the four functions Most framing analysis approaches focus on manual analysis of articles Only recently some computer-assisted methods gained interest As a result the identification of frames often falls into a methodological black box Thereby the main issue includes the ambiguity of which elements should be present in an article or news story to signify the existence of a frame To overcome this problem some recent studies propose a novel identification method based on the extraction of the four aforementioned framing aspects in the definition of Entman Focus Group Setup To guide the operationalization of framing we began with a qualitative analysis In a small focus group we aimed to gain insights into how the four framing functions of the main frame of an article manifest in its content and how to identify them computationally Participants We invited three experts in the field of news framing analysis All experts had a background in journalism communication or news media and multiple years of relevant experience Materials As a basis for discussion we used opinion pieces on the topic of Dutch farmers protests Opinion pieces refer to news articles that reflect the authors opinion and thus do not claim to be objective Our domain experts indicated that this type of news article is the most suitable to identify framing functions Procedure The focus group procedure consisted of two steps Annotation session First the participants were asked to perform framing analysis on an opinion piece using the four framing functions as described by Entman In particular the participants had to individually highlight parts of the article such as word clauses or sentences that can be related to one of the four framing functions of the main frame of the news article Review session Second the results were discussed together with some general questions on news article analysis and framing For every highlighted part we asked the participants to motivate why the highlighted part is related to one of the four framing functions Besides we used the results as input to a broader discussion on news article analysis and framing such as What main heuristic did you use to analyze the article What procedure did you follow to analyze the framing functions of the article Can you derive any patterns in the way framing functions manifest in opinion pieces Results of Framing Analysis In the review session experts indicated the structure of the article as the main heuristic to find the framing functions of the main frame They also mentioned that opinion pieces are strongly shaped by journalistic values on how an article should be structured We then analyzed this heuristic according to the four framing functions Problem Definition In opinion pieces the first part of the article often presents the main problem that the author addresses and includes the title the lede and the first x paragraphs Work on manual frame analysis supports this finding The number of introductory paragraphs x can be different per source author or article Causal Attribution Moral Evaluation The body of an article is used to analyze the main problem and usually contains different factors that contribute to the problem under investigation and their evaluation We can match this with a the causal attribution of a frame forces creating the problem and b the moral judgements evaluate the causal attribution and their effect Treatment Recommendation Treatment recommendations can be seen as suggestions to improve or solve the issue described by the problem definition of the main frame They normally appear in the concluding paragraphs according to the focus group members This structure however is only a heuristic applying just to opinion pieces Other types ie interviews are structured differently The results of the annotation session also indicate that each framing function related to the main frame of an article can normally be found within one paragraph Additionally a paragraph can include multiple framing functions but words clauses and sentences generally represent a single framing function DATASET The experimental dataset used in our studies consists of opinion pieces in Dutch The choice of article type is motivated by the focus group session presented in Section in which the structure of this article type is put forward as the primary heuristic to find framing aspects We picked topics that we expected a to be present on the Blendle platform at the time when we performed the online user study b to contain different viewpoints addressed in the news and c to balance issues that more current versus long-standing The dataset consists of four ongoing topics Black Lives Matter Coronavirus US Elections as more current topics and the dominance and privacy issues around Big Tech as a long-standing topic We collected our dataset from an archive containing more than million Dutch news articles The archive is known to undergo checks for articles quality to remove undesirable content such as the weather or short actualities For each topic we used the search terms queries and restrictions shown in our GitHub repository We provide the list of search terms in Dutch because we do not want to add additional bias through translation Additionally since the proposed method heavily relies on the structure of the article we set up a filter for the minimum number of words to and a filter for the minimum number of paragraphs to Table provides an overview of the dataset per topic While the length of the articles varies across topics they are usually far longer than the word limit we chose Four publishers are present for all topics De Volkskrant De Standaard Trouw and Het Algemeen Dagblad Furthermore De Volkskrant is the most prominent publisher for all topics except for the US Elections topic The inclusion of other less frequent publishers varies per topic Overall our dataset covers a set of unique publishers We also present some properties concerning the presentation characteristics of the articles on the news aggregator website We observe that the ratio of articles that contains a thumbnail image depends on the topic For the Black Lives Matter and Coronavirus topics more than half of the articles have a thumbnail image while the opposite holds for the other two topics The number of custom titles from the editorial team and the average title length also differ considerable per topic Only a few articles have an editorial title and they usually appear for the Big Tech and US Elections topics Table Overview of the experimental dataset per topic Topic Articles Publishers Avg Words With thumb With ed title Avg title length Black Lives Matter Coronavirus US Elections Big Tech VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY METHODOLOGY We proposed a novel diversification method based on framing aspects using the insights from the focus group First we describe the extraction pipeline which supports the structure heuristic described in the results of the focus group session Section The Search queries pipeline forms the basis for the generation of recommendation lists that we use in the offline evaluation Section and the online study Section We implemented the pipeline using methods employed by the news aggregator platform and off-the-shelf natural language processing toolkits such as the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding IBM Watson NLU We chose to use state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf methods used by Blendle to ensure output quality Then we describe the distance function which combines the metadata related to each framing aspect in a measure for viewpoint diversity for news articles Finally we present the re-ranking algorithm based on this viewpoint diversity measure Our contribution stands in the novelty of the overall diversification framework rather than the implementation of specific components Figure shows an overview of the end-to-end pipeline Figure Viewpoint diversification pipeline describing a article enrichment b diversity functions and c re-ranking Color coding indicates the four different framing functions and color blending is applied where the pipeline contributes to both causal attribution and moral evaluation Metadata Extraction For each framing aspect as described in the definition of Entman we implemented an extraction pipeline Problem Definition As described in Section the problem definition can be understood as the central issue or topic under investigation Therefore we decided to use a topic model as the main extraction method for this framing aspect The model provided by the research partner at Blendle included a topic latent Dirichlet allocation LDA model trained on Dutch news articles Based on the conclusions from the focus group described in Section the title and the first paragraphs are used to retrieve Diversification pipeline metadata related to this framing aspect We also applied multiple pre-processing steps on the content including cleaning chunking tokenization lemmatization and stop-word removal Causal Attribution Moral Evaluation The causal attribution of a frame relates to the forces creating the problem while the moral judgements evaluate the causal attribution and their effect In the focus group session Section we concluded that the body of an article usually elaborates on these aspects Additionally paragraph-level seems to be the most suitable level of analysis Thus we first translated the news articles in English using Google Translate and then we applied a text-classification algorithm using IBM Watson NLU The service returns a category for each paragraph according to a predefined five-level taxonomy from the most general category eg level technology and computing to the most specific one eg level portable computer To extract information related to the evaluation of these attributions we also analyze the sentiment of these paragraphs in English using IBM Watson NLU Thereby it would be able to identify if two articles evaluate the same aspects of a problem differently The content of interest for this task includes all paragraphs except the introductory and concluding paragraphs We optimize these variables during the offline evaluation Treatment Recommendation A treatment recommendation suggests remedies for problems and predicts their likely effect The research domain of suggestion mining the task of retrieving sentences that contain advice tips warnings and recommendations from opinionated texts was found to be highly relevant for this framing aspect However the state-of-the-art models are topic-specific and can not be easily applicable to our domain Thus a more naive rule-based approach was applied for this study being more generally applicable In a crowdsourcing task with domain experts we evaluated and optimized the generally applicable rules from the literature on the news article content Afterwards we implemented the method to extract sentences that contain suggestions from the article content translated in English using Google Translate beforehand To obtain comparable information between the suggestions of two articles the suggestion sentences were classified using the same text-classification algorithm as for causal attribution According to the focus group discussion the content of interest for this framing aspect includes the concluding paragraphs of an article We optimize this variable in the offline evaluation Distance Functions Having defined the extraction pipeline for each framing aspect ie problem definition causal attribution moral evaluation and treatment recommendation we now define our distance function We compare the extracted metadata for every pair of articles Thus we implement a distance function for each framing aspect Problem Definition The metadata regarding the problem definition framing aspect involves a probability distribution over topics Thus we need a statistical distance measure We chose the Kullback-Leibler divergence because it is one of the most commonly used statistical distance measures for LDA-models and it is used in comparable work on viewpoint diversification Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation We compare the five-level taxonomy categories extracted from the pipeline described in the previous section to obtain a distance measure for the causal attribution framing function of the primary frame Thus we use the weighted Jaccard index which measures the similarity or diversity of two sets The index is calculated for each level of detail in the five-level taxonomy such that we apply weight factors per taxonomy level Thereby overlap in higher levels of detail can contribute more to the overall similarity score In the offline evaluation we compare different weight factors per taxonomy-levels For the moral evaluation framing aspect we implement the distance function by multiplying the Jaccard distance and the absolute sentiment difference between each paragraph combination of two articles Thus paragraphs with no overlapping categories yield a value of zero while highly similar paragraphs with different sentiment scores lead to high levels of diversity related to the moral evaluation framing aspect Treatment Recommendation For the treatment recommendation the distance function is identical to the distance function related to the causal attribution Thus we used the five-level taxonomy classification ie from the most general to the most specific category as returned by IBM Watson NLU and the Jaccard index Re-ranking We implement the re-ranking of the input list of articles using the Maximal Marginal Relevance MMR algorithm In our case the re-ranking consists of ranking news articles that are more diverse higher First we normalize the output of the distance functions related to each framing aspect using a min-max normalization and then we combine them in a diversity score through a weighted sum We optimize the weight factors during the offline evaluation Note here that we re-rank news articles that are known to also be relevant for the given topic Where most re-ranking algorithms for recommender systems order lists only on relevance the MMR algorithm provides a linear combination between diversity in our case viewpoint diversity and relevance set by the parameter Thus the re-ranking algorithm is defined as follows mmr max max In is the ranked list of relevant articles is the list of selected articles in and is the list of articles in that are not yet selected Simaxnce this work proposes a measure for viewpoint diversity rather than a relevance measure we implemented the relevance score using a simple frequency-inverse document frequency TF-IDF score In the parameter takes values in where returns a list of articles ranked only on relevance while returns a list of articles ranked on maximum diversity OFFLINE EVALUATION In this section we describe the offline evaluation of our viewpoint diversity-driven approach for re-ranking lists of news articles Materials For our offline experiment we used the news dataset introduced in Section which covers news articles on four topics Procedure The experimental procedure consists of four main steps that we detail as follows First we process and enrich all the news articles in our dataset according to the four framing aspects problem definition causal attribution moral evaluation and treatment recommendations for details see Section Second we generate the diversity matrix by comparing all combinations of two articles based on the enrichment described in Section Thus using the distance function defined in Section we measure the dissimilarity of two articles based on the framing aspects Finally since the MMR algorithm re-ranks a list of news articles based on a linear combination between diversity and relevance we calculate the TF-IDF relevance matrix including a relevance score for each two article combination Third we optimize the model variables and evaluate the performance on the diversity metric in Section using cross-validation For each article in the dataset we calculate a set of recommendations by re-ranking the remainder articles in the dataset To prevent over-fitting we use cross-validation We split the dataset into distinct sets We experimented with different values of and For every set we take the following steps Grid search of model variables on training set The training set contains the subsets of articles We obtain the optimal combination of the model variables for the training set using a grid search An overview of the model variables can be found in Table and in Section Evaluation on test set After the variables are trained on the subsets the model is evaluated on the test set for different values of between and with a step of As described before for each article in the test set a set of recommendations is calculated by re-ranking the remaining articles in the dataset And finally we combined the results of all cross-validations Table Overview of possible values of model variables Variable Values Weight Framing function Problem Definition Weight Framing function Causal Attribution Weight Framing function Moral Evaluation Weight Framing function Treatment Recommendation Taxonomy level weight equal ascending Number of introducing paragraphs Number of concluding paragraphs Note that all framing function weight factors should sum up to Model variables Table shows the model variables that we optimize during the offline evaluation We choose the variation of the weights for each framing aspect such that no single framing aspect can have the majority Additionally a step-size of is assumed to bring enough variation We consider two variations for the taxonomy level weights equal weights for each taxonomy level or ascending weights Finally the number of introductory and concluding paragraphs can be either or Evaluation Metrics We assess the performance of the viewpoint diversification method using a metric from literature based on the Intra-List Diversity metric It is defined as the average distance between all pairs of articles and such that Thereby the distance between a pair is defined by the articles channels predefined taxonomy of high-level topics and the articles LDA topic-distribution as derived from the enrichment methods in Section distance distance channels distance LDA The channel distance is calculated using the cosine distance whereas the LDA distance using the Kullback-Leibler divergence Additional metrics We also measure the effectiveness of the diversification model on other properties as follows Relevance We measure the TF-IDF relevance for the recommendation lists such that we can measure the effectiveness of the viewpoint diversification method Kendalls We compute the Kendalls rank correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between two ranks of recommended items Average number of words We compute the average number of words for the recommended article lists as a measure of quality ie longer news articles can be considered to be higher quality Publisher Ratio We measure the publisher ratio for the recommendation lists because this could potentially provide insights on the effect of the content diversity on the source diversity Baseline To assess if the proposed diversification method can increase the viewpoint diversity based on the presented metric we compare it with a baseline consisting of a full relevance MMR where such that we rank the recommendations purely on the TF-IDF relevance We chose this baseline because it has minimal effects on the recommendations in terms of viewpoint diversity Results In Figure we show the performance of the model in terms of viewpoint diversity and relevance for different values of and the optimal setting of the model variables see Table for the optimal model variables values per topic Variations of the cross-validation variable did not yield significant differences between the results and thus we fixed The list size did show to influence the number of publishers included in the recommended list but the results were not significant Thus we fixed the list size to to align with the online evaluation set up where only recommended articles can be shown at a time Across all topics the proposed diversification method is capable of increasing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists According to the metric the viewpoint diversity increases on average from to between and Additionally the average relevance score decreases from to In our project repository we provide examples of ranked lists of articles based on relevance and diversity for the topic of Coronavirus Ranked list of relevant and diverse news articles a Topic Black Lives Matter b Topic Coronavirus c Topic US Elections d Topic Big Tech Figure Diversity and relevance scores for different values of per topic a Topic Black Lives Matter b Topic Coronavirus c Topic US Elections d Topic Big Tech Figure Average number of publishers in recommendation lists normalised by the input ratio for all topics Table Overview of model variables used during the offline and online evaluation for each topic cross validation folds recommended list size number of introductory paragraphs number of concluding paragraphs general weights for the four framing aspects category weights and Topic intro par par general weight cat weight Black Lives Matter Coronavirus US Elections Big Tech Kendalls We computed the Kendalls rank correlation to assess whether the proposed diversification method is capable of providing different recommendation lists compared to the baseline We computed the coefficient between the baseline and each other value of Overall we observed that the re-ranking of the set of recommendations based on viewpoint diversity results in different recommendation lists compared to the baseline The coefficient decreases for smaller values of but it is bounded around for decreasing values of Average number of words We observe no consistent pattern in the average number of words for different values of across topics For the Black Lives Matter and Big Tech topics the average number of words increases for larger values of for the US Elections topic the average decreases and for Coronavirus the average is stable Publisher ratio Figure shows the average number of articles in the recommended lists normalized by the input ratio for each value of For every topic the number of publishers increases for larger values of and the number of different publishers for the baseline recommendation list is larger than the one in the diverse recommendation list Thus we observe that the diversification method influences the publisher ratio For small values some publishers get amplified while others are excluded We see this effect primarily for the topics of US Elections and Big Tech Coronavirus seems to be the only exception We further discuss this in Section ONLINE STUDY We conducted a between-subjects online study on the Blendle platform to compare the reading behaviour of users who receive news articles optimized only for relevance versus news articles that are also diverse on viewpoint Materials In the online study we used the articles collected in Section Participants We selected active users of the news aggregator platform These users were assumed to most likely see and use the recommendation functionality We included only users who clicked at least four times on a recommended article below any article read in the last days before the study Groups for baseline and diversified recommendations were created by randomly splitting the users Independent Variables In the between-subjects user study we manipulated the following conditions referring to the recommended list of news articles baseline recommendation was implemented using a MMR that was based only on relevance Online study interface and setup diversified recommendation was implemented using a MMR that maximized viewpoint diversity Procedure During the two-week experiment six days per week we provided recommendations for two articles featured on the selected users homepage We provided sets of three recommendations below the content on the reading page of the original article Every morning we chose these two articles manually to match the selected topics Black Lives Matter Big Tech Coronavirus and US Elections Afterwards both the baseline and diversified recommendation sets were calculated for both articles and shown on the Blendle platform Dependent Variables To analyze the reading behaviour of the two different user groups and answer we measure specific events on the news aggregator platform ie check whether the user opened the article and if the user finished reading the article Based on these available events we observe multiple implicit click-through-rate per news article click-through-rate per recommendation set and completion rate of recommendation and explicit heart ratio measures of the reading behaviour To answer we look into presentation characteristics of the recommended articles ie presence of editorial title presence of thumbnail and counting number of hearts Click-through rate per article The number of clicks on a news article is divided by the total number of users who finished one of the original news articles for which that article was recommended The completion of an original news article is registered using a scroll-position Click-through rate per recommendation set The total number of clicks on either of the three news articles in the recommendation set is divided by the number of users who finished the original news article using scroll-position for which the recommendation set was presented Completion rate of recommendation Is implemented as the number of users that read the full recommended article using scroll-position divided by the number of users who opened the news article The completion rate is assumed to be a measure for the user satisfaction with the recommendations We can argue that short news articles are more likely to be completed than long news articles Thus we also analyze the completion rate of a news article in relation to the number of words in the news article Favourite ratio The news aggregator platform allows users to mark an article as a favourite illustrated by an icon of a heart The users can click this icon at the end of the article content We implemented the measure as the number of users of the user group baseline or diverse that clicked on the icon divided by the number of users in the same group that completed the article The metric is assumed to be a marker of user satisfaction with the article Presentation characteristics We measured three additional properties of a recommended article during the experiment which referred to the presentation characteristics of recommended news articles First the editorial team can replace the original title of a news article with a custom editorial title In general these custom titles are longer and more explanatory than the original ones Second articles can be presented with or without a thumbnail image Third the number of users who selected the article as a favourite is visualised by a counting number of hearts in the left-upper corner of an article banner All three properties are assumed to potentially influence the click-through rate and are therefore measured during the experiment Source diversity Finally we also measured the influence of the source diversity of the recommendation set on the click-through rate As seen in Section higher levels of viewpoint diversity showed to influence the number of times a publisher is included in the recommendation Results The online study ran six days a week for two weeks Thus we provided recommendations below articles During the experiment the topic of Coronavirus became extremely prominent so we provided recommendations below out of news articles on this topic In contrast the Black Lives Matter topic lost all actuality resulting in no recommendations for this topic For the US Elections topic we provided recommendations below four articles and for the Big Tech topic below two news articles Click-through rate per recommended article The mean click through rate per recommended article for the baseline was stderr while for the diversified recommendations was stderr when looking at all topics Furthermore cf Mann-Whitney U test U p-val we did not find a significant difference between the two user groups in terms of click-through rate per recommended article same result per topic Click-through rate per recommended set The mean click-through rate per recommended set for the baseline recommendations was stderr while for the diversified recommendations was stderr when looking at all topics Figure a According to the Mann-Whitney U test U p-val we find a significant difference between the mean click-through rate per recommended sets for the two user groups Per topic we only find a significant difference for Coronavirus Figure b with a clickthrough rate per recommended set of stderr for the baseline and stderr for the diversified recommendations U p-val For the other topics we found no significant difference between the two user groups Completion rate We found no significant difference in terms of completion rate for the two users groups cf Mann-Whitney U test U p-val We also applied the Spearmans rank correlation to see whether the completion rate is correlated with the length of the articles However we found no correlation in either of the two conditions baseline group p-val diverse group p-val Heart ratio We found no significant difference cf Mann-Whitney U test for all topics and across topics U p-val in terms of heart ratio for the two user groups Thus the recommendations quality was comparable between the two conditions Influence of presentation characteristics We measured the influence of three factors namely the presence of an editorial title the presence of a thumbnail and the number of users that chose the article as a favourite on the click-through rate of an article a Click-through rate per recommended set for the two user groups b Click-through rate per recommended set and per topic for the diversified user group c Influence of the thumbnail image as presentation characteristic for the two user groups d Influence of the hearts as presentation characteristic for the two user groups Figure Overview of significant results in the online study Editorial title Regarding the influence of the inclusion of an editorial title on the click-through rate no statistical significance was found for neither user groups cf Mann-Whitney U test baseline U p-val diverse U p-val Thumbnail image We found no statistically significant influence of the inclusion of a thumbnail image on the click-through rate for baseline users cf Mann-Whitney U test U p-val In contrast we found a statistically significant difference for diverse users U p-val Recommendations with a thumbnail are more times opened than recommendations without a thumbnail for diverse users as seen in Figure c Favorite articles We applied the Spearmans rank correlation to see whether we find a correlation between the click-through rate and the number of hearts Figure d shows the distribution of click-through rates and the number of hearts We only found a moderate positive correlation of also statistically significant p-val for the diversified user group Source diversity As seen in the offline evaluation higher levels of viewpoint diversity turned out to have remarkable effects on the publisher ratio Therefore we also evaluated the effect of the source diversity of a recommendation set on the click-through rate For each recommendation set we computed the number of different publishers and we found recommendation sets in which all articles are from a different publisher and sets in which two articles are from the same publisher Afterwards the click-through was calculated for each category The results for both the baseline users and diverse users show that no statistically significant difference can be found in the click-through rate between two or three different publishers in the recommendation set for neither baseline nor diversified users DISCUSSION We first discuss the results of the offline and online evaluation and then provide an overview of the limitations of our approach We conclude with directions for future work Offline Evaluation The offline evaluation indicated that the proposed method is capable of increasing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation sets according to the metric defined in previous literature The average viewpoint diversity scores across all topics increased from to for an increasing level of diversity in the MMR algorithm Simultaneously the average relevance score decreased from to Remarkably the diversity score of in is considerably smaller than the maximum average value of found in this work A possible factor could be that in the LDA topic model was excluded from the diversification method to prevent any interference with the evaluation metric whereas the diversification method in this work still depends on an LDA topic-model Therefore the difference in viewpoint diversity scores between the methods can possibly appear due to the interference of metadata between the viewpoint diversity metric and diversification method in this work In the offline evaluation we saw that the publisher ratio decreases for larger diversity in the MMR lower values of We found that the maximum frequency of an article in the recommendation lists is around to times higher at compared to Thus for larger contributions of diversity the algorithm increasingly selects the same article recommendation This suggests that some news articles in the dataset get amplified thereby suppressing the inclusion of different sources To study this effect thoroughly the offline evaluation should allow for the assessment of the contribution of individual framing aspects to the global viewpoint diversity score per article These results also suggest caution for very low values of since this may consistently amplify single articles representing particularly diverse and potentially more extreme views Although approaches that use source diversity are more popular scholars generally agree that viewpoint diversity can only be achieved by fostering content diversity because multiple sources can still refer to the same point of view Based on these findings this study used a content-based approach In the offline evaluation it became clear that increasing levels of content diversity exclude multiple publishers and thus decreases source diversity Moreover some specific publishers got amplified remarkably for high levels of content diversity Thus viewpoint diversification methods could benefit from considering both content and source diversity Online Evaluation No major influence of viewpoint diversification on the reading behaviour was found except for the click-through rate calculated per recommendation set which indicated a statistically significant difference between baseline and diverse users of in favour for baseline recommendations However the results of the clickthrough rate calculated per recommendation indicated no significant difference between the two user groups Likewise the other two measurements of the reading behaviour including the completion rate of recommendations and the ratio of users who selected a recommendation as a favourite showed no significant difference between baseline and diverse users In reflection on the motivation of this study the proposed diversification for news media is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of news recommendation while maintaining comparable measures of the reading behaviour of users The results thus suggest that recommender systems are capable of preserving the quality standards of multiperspectivity in online news environments Thereby situations of extreme low diversity known as filter bubbles could also be mitigated These results are in contrast with the most comparable study which found a negative effect on intent to read diversified news articles The authors proposed a viewpoint diversification method based on the MMR-algorithm with linguistic features such as gravity complexity and emotional tone During a user study participants were asked to make a forced choice between a recommendation from the diverse set and a recommendation from the baseline set after reading an article on the same topic It was found that of the participants chose the baseline article compared with who chose the diverse article However in the current study we observed the actual reading behaviour of both user groups and argue that the present setup holds a higher level of ecological validity Additionally the results shed light on the importance of how a recommendation is presented Multiple presentation properties such as the inclusion of a thumbnail image and the number of times an article is marked as favourite were shown to have a significant influence on the click-through rate of recommendations Future research thus should not only address the capability of a model to enhance viewpoint diversity according to an offline metric but also evaluate what presentation characteristics could impact the users willingness to read multiperspectival news Related research on viewpoint-aware interfaces which aim to explain the recommendation choices to users and research on interfaces for cognitive bias mitigation in recommender systems are valuable Limitations We further discuss the limitations of our approach Choice of participants in the online study Only users who frequently followed recommendations below articles were selected for the experiment Thus the click-through rates presented in this study are higher than for average news readers Limited number of topics and articles For both the online and offline evaluations we used only opinion pieces Furthermore each evaluation had a limited number of topics namely four as well as a limited number of news articles New topics could reveal additional results that hold across topics Missing user perceptions While we could study user behavior at a reasonable scale a notable omission is users qualitative judgement of viewpoint diversity in the resulting recommendations We plan to continue collaborating with the news aggregator platform to refine the proposed framework ie to improve viewpoint extraction Presentation characteristics Some presentation characteristics and in particular the heart ratio could also be markers of quality Further qualitative analysis is needed to eg understand how much of user behavior is directed by quality We also saw that for some topics the presence of thumbnail was more common than for other topics and it would be relevant to study whether this also interacted with user perceptions of relevance or quality Relevance metric The offline study could use amore sophisticated relevance measure between the recommendation and the original article The relevance score was based on a simple TF-IDF score limited to the terms in a handcrafted search query Influence of Given limited time for online testing we only compared against a maximum viewpoint diversity score Influence of publishers In Figure we see that although publishers are represented in the datasets three publishers are predominant Due to the limited number of articles and the unbalance in terms of publishers the inclusion of a wide variety of perspectives on a topic can be challenged Future Work As future work we plan to investigate further the presentation characteristics and how they influence user experience in addition to behaviour In more controlled settings we will study the relative effects of actual eg as judged by experts versus perceived quality eg number of hearts in the interface of recommended news items Future work will also focus on defining a better metric to measure viewpoint diversity as opposed to topic diversity cf Additionally we learnt that contextual information general knowledge about a topic eg current measures in place to stop the virus spread can also be essential to reveal a specific frame We hope this work will encourage further research on defining conceptualizing and evaluating framing in the computational domain CONCLUSIONS In this paper we proposed a novel method for enhancing the diversity of viewpoints in lists of news recommendations Inspired by research in communication science we identified frames as the most suitable conceptualization for news content diversity We operationalized this concept as a computational measure and we applied it in a re-ranking of topic relevant recommended lists to form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method In an offline evaluation we found that the proposed method improved the diversity of the recommended items considerably according to a viewpoint diversity metric from literature We also conducted an online study with more than users on the Blendle platform a Dutch news aggregator The reading behaviour of users receiving diversified recommendations was largely comparable to those in the baseline Besides the results suggest that presentation characteristics thumbnail image and the number of hearts lead to significant differences in reading behaviour These results suggest that research on presentation aspects for recommendations may be just as relevant as novel viewpoint diversification methods to achieve multiperspectivity in automated online news environments
