Price Discrimination with Fairness Constraints Price discrimination offering different prices to different customers has become common practice While it allows sellers to increase their profits it also raises several concerns in terms of fairness This topic has received extensive attention from media industry and regulatory agencies In this paper we consider the problem of setting prices for different groups under fairness constraints In this paper we propose a formal framework for pricing with fairness including several definitions of fairness and their potential impact on consumers sellers and society at large In a first step towards the ambitious agenda of designing pricing strategies that are fair we consider the simplest scenario of a single-product seller facing consumers who can be partitioned into two groups based on a single binary feature observable to the seller For each group we assume that the seller knows the valuation distribution and the population size The sellers goal is to maximize profit by optimally selecting a price for each group subject to a fairness constraint which may be self-imposed or explicitly enforced by laws and regulations We first propose four definitions fairness in price demand consumer surplus and no-purchase valuation With our model and definitions in place we first show that satisfying all four fairness goals simultaneously is impossible unless the mean valuations are the same for both groups In fact even achieving two fairness measures simultaneously cannot be done in basic settings We then consider the impact of imposing each fairness criterion separately and identify conditions under which the consumer surplus and the social welfare increase or decrease Under linear or exponential demand we show that imposing a small amount of fairness in price or no-purchase valuation increases social welfare whereas fairness in demand or surplus reduces social welfare We fully characterize the impact of imposing different types of fairness for linear demand We discover that imposing too much price fairness may result in a lower social welfare relative to imposing no price fairness Imposing demand and surplus fairness always decreases social welfare However imposing no-purchase valuation fairness always increases social welfare We also extend our results to the cases when there are multiple groups or there is an unprotected feature Finally we computationally show that most of our findings continue to hold for three common nonlinear demand models Our results and insights provide a first step in understanding the impact of imposing fairness in the context of pricing Applied computing Economics Law Information systems Personalization Social and professional topics Pricing and resource allocation KEYWORDS fairness price discrimination personalization social welfare
