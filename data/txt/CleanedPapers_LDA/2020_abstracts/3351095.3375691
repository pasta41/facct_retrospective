When Not to Design Build or Deploy Social and professional topics Computing  technology policy Professional topics KEYWORDS technology policy technology refusal politics of tech refusal SESSION ABSTRACT Recent debate within the FAT community has focused on how the field conceptualizes the problems it seeks to address what approach the field should take in attempting to address these problems and whether the field should even pursue some of the proposed remedies Questions regarding when not to design build or deploy a technology are perhaps the most common expression of this trend Identifying the problems to address is inextricably linked to the broader question of how to collectively make decisions about what technologies our societies need and want While much extant FAT work to date has focused on various model and system interventions the goal of this session is to foster discussion of when we should not design build and deploy systems in the first place Given the recent push for moratoria on facial recognition protests around the sale of digital technologies represented by the hashtag TechWontBuildIt and the ongoing harms to marginalized groups from automated systems such as risk prediction or surveillance a broader discussion around how when and why to say no seems both relevant and urgent The discussion seeks to surface the question of when how and why not to design build or deploy to a broader audience of interested practitioners academics and society While the question is now common in critical FAT work drawing on the Science and Technology Studies literature we believe it remains under-articulated to many with training in machine learning and other areas of computer science We create the space for perspectives on why when and how to justify not deploying or building systems in part because the problem is so infrequently discussed The session through perspectives contributed by academics industrial practitioners and civil society activists seeks to provide the foundation for answering the long-term questions of Relevant historical and disciplinary contexts Assessing and articulating the social character of technologies is a venerable theme in the philosophy of technology How can we draw on these and other scholarly traditions to build frameworks to direct and prioritize our critical efforts today Frameworks and guidelines for practitioners to use when reasoning about not designing building or deploying Upon what values should we base our decisions regarding whether to build deploy and critique particular technologies How do we take all affected people and things into account in making such decisions And through what specific mechanisms should such decisions be made as a matter of practice Moreover what drives this idea from a practical perspective is the reality of practitioners and developers of socio-technical systems When faced with a task how do they decide if its morally acceptable Should the decision be based purely on intuition What are frameworks and resources they could use to make their decision and then defend it when confronting superiors Politics and aftermaths of refusal While practitioners or activists might often be the ones to flag projects as unacceptable no less important is who gets to decide whether or not projects go forward In the above scenario typically the engineer/student gets no say in the matter as the end decision is often made above that level It is crucial to understand the politics of how such decisions are made in practice as well as how should decisions like this get made What real alternatives are there to the way things are being done now Moreover despite all the efforts to just say no its urgent to ask what happens after the moratoria Are these attempts to reject a technology completely or temporarily halt its development and use until we have rules in place Is it even possible to regulate a technology out of existence Practically speaking what does a politics of refusal entail and require
