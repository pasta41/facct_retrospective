Bridging the Gap from AI Ethics Research to Practice The study of fairness in machine learning applications has seen significant academic inquiry research and publication in recent years Concurrently technology companies have begun to instantiate nascent program in AI ethics and product ethics more broadly As a result of these efforts AI ethics practitioners have piloted new processes to evaluate and ensure fairness in their machine learning applications In this session six industry practitioners hailing from LinkedIn Yoti Microsoft Pymetrics Facebook and Salesforce share insights from the work they have undertaken in the area of fairness what has worked and what has not lessons learned and best practices instituted as a result presents LinkedIns fairnessaware reranking for talent search shares how Yoti applies ML fairness research to age estimation in their digital identity platform Hanna Wallach contributes how Microsoft is applying fairness principles in practice Lewis Baker presents Pymetrics fairness mechanisms in their hiring algorithm presents Facebooks fairness assessment framework through a case study of fairness in a content moderation system contributes how Salesforce is building fairness features into the Einstein AI platform Building on those insights we discuss insights and brainstorm modalities through which to build upon the practitioners work Opportunities for further research or collaboration are identified with the goal of developing a shared understanding of experiences and needs of AI ethics practitioners Ultimately the aim is to develop a playbook for more ethical and fair AI product development and deployment Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence Cognitive science Machine learning Human-centered computing HCI theory concepts and models General and reference Evaluation KEYWORDS Artificial Intelligence algorithmic decision-making fairness ML fairness practitioners ethics data
