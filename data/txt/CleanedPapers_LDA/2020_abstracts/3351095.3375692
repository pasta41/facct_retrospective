CtrlZAI Zine Fair Critical Perspectives The FAT conference has begun the necessary conversation on the normative implications and ethical ramifications of sociotechnical systems However many scholars have pointed to the limitations in methodologies and scope of analysis eg In addition to these critiques we add in the fact that those who are most affected by this technology do not have the skills training or technical aptitude to participate in these conversations With the exception of the FAT tutorial which featured Terrance Wilkerson who had been labeled as likely to highly recidivate by COMPAS and his partner there has been silence from those most impacted by algorithmic unfairness at FAT This silence has been deafening as FAT conversations with a few notable exceptions eg have failed to discuss anti-racist politics prison abolition and social justice In response to these well-founded critiques we offer CtrlZAI zine fair focused on technology and AI This event will center perspectives and methodologies often overlooked by the FAT community By pairing CtrlZAI with FAT we hope to bring the academic research community into conversation with artists activists and diverse communities affected by algorithmic systems Zines are self-published self-distributed small-circulation magazines Both the creation and distribution of zines tends to operate outside the bounds of mainstream commercial settings providing an accessible and liberating alternative to those who may be excluded from or constrained by traditional publishing options Zine culture also plays an important community building role through person-to-person dissemination and an emphasis on knowledge sharing and personal experiences Our CRAFT workshop will bring the FAT community into conversation with artists activists and communities affected by these technologies We chose to place this engagement within the context of a zine fair since zine culture embodies an alternative orientation and mindset Specifically zines represent an accessible and community-oriented mode of creating and disseminating content Modern day zine culture has been embraced by many different marginalized communities zines tend to center narrative content and lived experiences For instance Mimi Onuoha and Mother Cyborgs A Peoples Guide to AI connects AI to the ubiquity of automated decision-making systems in everyday life and relates AI development to issues of access power and speculative futures By centering the way in which diverse communities experience technologies we hope to bring fresh and important perspectives into the FAT community In accordance with similar interventions such as the Design Justice and Our Data Bodies projects we envision an environment in which the knowledge and life experiences from these communities are centered and taken seriously As discussed further below we will provide a space for DIY creators to circulate and showcase their work Zines also play an important role in subversive social movements and grassroots activism communities FAT has been criticized for its tendency to shy away from justice oriented discourse and work We hope this zine fair with provide an opportunity for data and tech justice advocates to come into conversation with the FAT community We also recognize zines as important knowledge-sharing and community-building tools In addition to creating a platform for activists and artists to showcase their work we will also facilitate a session whereby collective learnings and experiences can be distilled into a zine with low barriers to both creation and readership The CtrlZAI zine and art fair will run for eight hours at an external site and consist of four components First the fair itself will be open to a set of contributing tablers who will present and sell their own work Second we will feature a curated selection of physical zines available from contributors who cannot be copresent for the fair Third we will call for artifacts which may not be full zines but can be incorporated or fleshed out in the course of the event This can include images quotes or parts of zines which are unfinished prior to the event Lastly we will hold three hours of workshop sessions over the course of the event
