Morality can be divided into political and personal morality, ethics into  narrower and wider ethics. Political morality applies to institutions and the state, and  in some cases can be equated to political justice. (Note that Dworkin distinguishes  political morality from the Rawlsian notion of justice, in JUSTICE FOR HEDGEHOGS  (2011), Part V.) The other morality, personal morality, and ethics understood widely,  are about how we ought to behave toward other people, what we owe to each other.  Finally, the narrower understanding of ethics, purely personal ethics, is about how to  live one’s life well. For Dworkin all these notions are related, but these distinctions  can clarify some of our uses of the language of ethics and morality",1986

Retrieved July 29, 2019 from https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annalsof-technology/the-hidden-costs-of-automated-thinking    APPENDIX  Translated version of the vignette utilized in the questionnaire  for introducing the general functionality of ADM systems to participants:  Currently, there is a lot of public talk about “artificial intelligence” (AI). This refers to computer applications that automatically  evaluate digital data. For AI, the evaluation of large amounts of  data represents a learning process from which it continuously processes new information and, thus, recognizes increasingly precise  patterns over time. On the basis of this analysis, facts can be established and future developments can be forecast. Systems with artificial intelligence can propose recommendations for action to humans or make autonomous decisions and execute them directly.    Translated version of the vignette utilized in the questionnaire  for introducing the use of ADM systems for higher education admissions to participants:  Let us now take a closer look at a possible application of artificial intelligence in higher education—namely, admission to a study  course.  Committees comprising members who advise on the suitability  of applicants and decide on admission (so-called admission or selection committees) usually allocate students to degree programs  with restricted admissions.  Recently, artificial intelligence technologies that can take on  this task have become available. Such AI applications analyze the  available data to determine who is particularly suitable for a particular subject. On this basis, the system issues an approval or rejection recommendation",2019
