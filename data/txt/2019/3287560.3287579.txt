ABSTRACT
We identify and explore differential access to population-level sig-
naling (also known as information design) as a source of unequal
access to opportunity. A population-level signaler has potentially
noisy observations of a binary type for each member of a popula-
tion and, based on this, produces a signal about each member. A
decision-maker infers types from signals and accepts those indi-
viduals whose type is high in expectation. We assume the signaler
of the disadvantaged population reveals her observations to the
decision-maker, whereas the signaler of the advantaged population
forms signals strategically. We study the expected utility of the
populations as measured by the fraction of accepted members, as
well as the false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR).
We first show the intuitive results that for a fixed environment,
the advantaged population has higher expected utility, higher FPR,
and lower FNR, than the disadvantaged one (despite having identical
population quality), and that more accurate observations improve
the expected utility of the advantaged population while harming
that of the disadvantaged one. We next explore the introduction
of a publicly-observable signal, such as a test score, as a potential
intervention. Our main finding is that this natural intervention,
intended to reduce the inequality between the populations’ utilities,
may actually exacerbate it in settings where observations and test
scores are noisy.

1 INTRODUCTION
Settings where personal data drive consequential decisions, at large
scale, abound—financial data determine loan decisions, personal
history affects bail and sentencing, academic records feed into
admissions and hiring. Data-driven decision-making is not reserved
for major life events, of course; on a minute-by-minute basis, our
digital trails are used to determine the news we see, the job ads we
are shown, and the behaviors we are nudged towards.
There has been an explosion of interest recently in the ways in
which such data-driven decision-making can reinforce and amplify
injustices. One goal of the literature has been to identify the points
in the decision-making pipeline that can contribute to unfairness.
For example, are data more noisy or less plentiful for a disadvantaged
population than for an advantaged one? Are the available data less
relevant to the decision-making task with respect to the disadvan-
taged population? Has the disadvantaged population historically
been prevented or discouraged from acquiring good data profiles that
would lead to favorable decisions? Is the decision-maker simply
making worse decisions about the disadvantaged population, despite
access to data that could prevent it?
In this paper, we study access to population-level signaling as a
source of inequity that, to our knowledge, has not received attention
in the literature. We consider settings where the data of individuals
in a population passes to a population-level signaler, and the signaler
determines what function of the data is provided as a signal to
a decision-maker. The signaler can serve as an advocate for the
population by filtering or noising its individuals’ data, but cannot
outright lie to the decision-maker; whatever function the signaler
chooses to map from individuals’ data to signals must be fixed and
known to the decision-maker.
Examples of population-level strategic signalers include high
schools, who, in order to increase the chances that their students
will be admitted to prestigious universities, inflate their grades,
refuse to release class rankings [35], and provide glowing recom-
mendation letters for more than just the best students. Likewise,
law firms advocate on behalf of their client populations by selec-
tively revealing information or advocating for trial vs. plea bargains.
Even the choice of advertisements we see online is based on signals
about us sold by exchanges, who wish to make their ad-viewing
population seem as valuable as possible.
Our interest in asymmetric information in general and in popula-
tion level strategic signaling in particular are inspired by the recent
wave of interest in these issues in the economics literature (see Sec-
tion 2 for an overview). In particular, the model we adopt to study
these issues in the context of inequity parallels the highly influential
work on Bayesian persuasion [28] and information design [5].
In order to explore the role that population-level strategic sig-
naling can play in reinforcing inequity, we investigate its impact in
a stylized model of university admissions.
We consider a setting in which a high school’s information about
its students is noisy but unbiased. Throughout, we call this noisy
information grades, but emphasize that it may incorporate addi-
tional sources of information such as observations of personality
and effort, that are also indicative of student quality. Importantly,
all relevant information about student quality is observed directly
by the school alone.
The school then aggregates each student’s information into a
signal about that student that is transmitted to the university. This
aggregation method is called a signaling scheme, or informally, a
(randomized) mapping from a student’s information to a recom-
mendation. A school could, for instance, choose to give the same
recommendation for all its students, effectively aggregating the
information about all students into one statement about average
quality. Or, for example, the school could choose to provide positive
recommendations to only those students that it believes, based on
its information, to have high ability.
The university makes admission decisions based on these rec-
ommendations, with the goal of admitting qualified students and
rejecting unqualified ones.
tions designed to maximize the number of their students admitted
by the university. We call such a school strategic. Alternatively, a
school might simply report the information it has collected on its
students to the university directly. We call such a school revealing.
As is common in economics, we assume that the university knows
the signaling scheme chosen by the school (but does not know
the realization of any randomness the school uses in its mapping).
One justification typically given for such an assumption is that
the university could learn this mapping over time, as it observes
student quality from past years.
As expected, we find that strategic schools with accurate in-
formation about their students have a significant advantage over
revealing schools, and, in the absence of intervention, strategic
schools get more of their students (including unqualified ones)
admitted by the university.
A common intervention in this setting is the standardized test.
The university could require students to take a standardized test
before being considered for admission, and use test scores in addi-
tion to the school’s recommendations in an effort to enable more-
informed admissions decisions. Intuitively, the role of the standard-
ized test is that it “adds information back in” that was obfuscated
by a strategic school in its recommendations, and so one might nat-
urally expect the test to reduce inequity in the admissions process.
While such a standardized test does increase the accuracy of admis-
sions decisions, we show that when the test is a noisy estimate of
student quality, it may in fact exacerbate the impact of disparities
in signaling between schools.
Summary of contributions. We highlight access to strategic pop-
ulation level signaling, as studied in the economics literature, as
a potential source of inequity. We derive the optimal signaling
scheme for a school in Section 4.1 and compute the resulting school
utility and false positive and negative rates in Section 4.2. We then
show in Section 4.3 that disparities in abilities to signal strategically
can constitute a non-negligible source of inequity. In Section 5,
complementarities between students.
we study the effect of a standardized test that students must take
before applying to the university, and highlight its limitations in
addressing signaling-based inequity.
2 RELATEDWORK
There is a large literature on individual-level signaling in eco-
nomics, following on the Nobel-prize-winning work of Spence [38].
The general model there is quite different from our population-level
signaling model; in the Spence model, individuals (not populations)
invest in costly (in terms of money or effort) signals whose costs
correlate with the individual’s type. In that model, equilibria can
emerge where high-type individuals are more likely to invest in the
signal than low-types, which can result in the signal being useful
for admissions or hiring.
Closer to our setting, Ostrovsky and Schwarz [35] study a model
in which schools provide noisy information about their students
to potential employers. Their focus is on understanding properties
of the equilibria of the system; they do not fully characterize the
equilibria, they do not consider the role of signaling in compounding
inequity, and they do not investigate the impact of interventions like
our standardized test. Unlike us, they do not consider the case where
the schools have imperfect observations of the students’ types.
Such work falls into a broader literature on optimal information
structures (e.g., [37]).
The impact of information asymmetries is a common theme
in economics today, with key early work including Brocas and
Carrillo [7]. Our model of signaling is inspired by the influential
work on Bayesian Persuasion [28], where a persuader (played, in
our model, by the school) commits to revealing some fixed function
of the types of the population it serves; this revelation is used
as the basis of a decision that impacts the welfare of both the
decider and the persuader (and the persuader’s constituents). The
Bayesian Persuasionmodel has been applied to a variety of domains,
e.g. [2, 4, 6, 16, 26, 34, 36, 39], and generalizations and alternatives
to this model have been studied in [1, 3, 20, 21, 33, 37]. Recent
work [10–14, 16, 22] has explored algorithmic aspects of persuasion
settings. To our knowledge, ours is the first work to consider access
to population-level signaling, Bayesian Persuasion, or information
design as a source of inequity.
Recent work on fairness has highlighted a number of objec-
tives that one might wish to enforce when allocating resources
to or making decisions about large numbers of individuals. At a
high level, these objectives tend to focus either on ensuring group-
level fairness [8, 17, 19, 23, 24, 29, 31, 32, 40] or individual-level
fairness [15, 27, 30]. The metrics we study—expected utility, false
positive rates and false negative rates—are generally considered to
be metrics of group fairness, but they also (coarsely) compare the
extent to which similar individuals are being treated similarly.
One very interesting recent paper on fairness [25] does incor-
porate Spence-style individual-level signaling; in their model, a
worker can choose whether and how much to invest in human
capital, and this acts as an imperfect signal on whether the worker
is qualified. Although their model and its implications are very dif-
ferent from ours, they similarly investigate the impact of upstream
interventions on downstream group-level unfairness. Similar no-
tions of individual-level signaling can also be found in [9, 18].
3 MODEL
We consider a setting with high schools (henceforth, “schools”),
and a single university. A school has a population of students. Each
student i has a binary type ti ∈ {0, 1} that represents the quality of
the student. The students’ types are drawn i.i.d. from a Bernoulli
distribution with mean p; that is, a student has type 1 w.p. p and 0
w.p. 1 − p. A student’s type is private, that is, known to the student
but unknown to both the school and the university. The prior p is
public and common knowledge to all agents.
A school observes noisy information about the types of each
of its students. To formally model this, we assume student i has a
grade дi ∈ {0, 1}, which is observed by the school but is unknown
to the university.
The gradeдi for student i is drawn as follows: Pr[дi = 0|ti = 0] =
Pr[дi = 1|ti = 1] = q, for q ∈ [1/2, 1].2 That is, the student’s type
is flipped with some probability 1 − q. As q increases, the grade дi
becomes amore accurate estimate of the student’s type ti . The grade
дi is known to the school but not the university. The distribution
q of the grade, however, is public, i.e., common knowledge to all
parties.
A school has access to a (possibly trivial or uncountably infi-
nite) set of signals Σ, and commits to a signaling scheme mapping
grades д to probability distributions over signals in Σ. For each
student i , the university makes an accept/reject decision based on
the distribution of the types p, the distribution of the grades q, and
the realization of the signal chosen by the school. The goal of the
university is to maximize the quality of the students it accepts.
over the set of students it accepts, with utility 1 for accepting a
student of high type (ti = 1), and utility −1 for a student with low
type (ti = 0). We assume that the university has unlimited capacity;
therefore, the university accepts exactly those students who induce
non-negative expected utility given the common priors and the
signal.
its students who are admitted to the university. We note that this
choice of utility measures the access to opportunity (defined as ad-
mittance to university) of the school’s students. We refer to a school
as revealing if it simply transmits the grade to the university as the
signal. We refer to a school as strategic if it employs the optimal
strategic signaling scheme, as examined in Section 4.1. A strategic
school thus maximizes its expected utility.
In several places, we will discuss the distribution of students
accepted by the university. To do so, it is useful to introduce the
notions of false positive and false negative rates. The false positive
rate of a school is the (expected) probability that a student with
type 0 is accepted by the university. The false negative rate of a
school is the (expected) probability that a student with type 1 is
rejected by the university.
We introduce several assumptions that restrict our attention
to settings of interest. First, we assume the expected quality of a
student is negative, such that the university would reject students
without any signal from the school.
set q = 1 − q, дi = 1 − дi and all results carry through by symmetry.
considers all students for admission.
Assumption 1. The university’s expected utility for accepting
any given student, absent any auxiliary information, is negative, i.e.,
p − (1 − p) < 0, and therefore p < 1/2.
Next we assume the university’s expected utility of accepting a
student with a high (resp. low) grade is positive (resp. negative).
Assumption 2. The university has non-negative expected utility
for accepting a student with a high grade, and negative expected
utility for accepting a student with a low grade:
Pr [t = 1|д = 1] − Pr [t = 0|д = 1] ≥ 0;
Pr [t = 1|д = 0] − Pr [t = 0|д = 0] < 0.
These can be rewritten as:
pq − (1 − p)(1 − q) ≥ 0;
p(1 − q) − (1 − p)q < 0.
We note that if the expected utility of accepting a student with a
high grade were negative, then none of the school’s students would
be admitted by the university under any signaling scheme. On the
other hand, if the expected utility of accepting a student with a low
grade were positive, then the university would always accept every
student.
in which the utilities of revealing and strategic schools may differ.
The following easy consequence of these assumptions will be
useful in our analysis.
Observation 3. Under Assumption 1, Assumption 2 implies q ≥
1 − p.
We conclude with the following well-known result (see, e.g.,
Kamenica and Gentzkow [28]) that an optimal signaling scheme
contains, without loss of generality, at most as many signals as
there are actions available to the decision-maker. In our setting,
this corresponds to restricting |Σ| = 2 as the university makes an
accept/reject decision for each student.
The result, reproduced below for our setting, follows from a
revelation-principle type argument. The idea is to replicate the
utilities of a signaling scheme with many signals by first producing
a signal according to the original scheme and then simply reporting
to the university, as a signal in the simplified scheme, the action
σ+ = accept or σ− = reject that it would choose to take as a result
of seeing the original signal.
Theorem 4 (Kamenica and Getzkow [28]). Suppose Σ is a mea-
surable (but potentially uncountable) set with at least two elements.
Let Σ′ be such that |Σ′ | = 2. Given any original signaling scheme
mapping to ∆ (Σ), there exists a new signaling scheme mapping to
∆ (Σ′) that induces the same utilities for the school and the univer-
sity as those induced by the original scheme. Further, one can write
Σ′ = {σ−,σ+} such that a student with signal σ+ is accepted by the
university with probability 1, and a student with signal σ− is rejected
with probability 1.
When |Σ| = 1, signals carry no information, making mute the
question of access to signaling schemes. Therefore, throughout
the paper, we make the assumption that |Σ| = 2 and denote its
elements by Σ = {σ+,σ−}. This is without loss of generality, by
the argument above.
4 THE IMPACTS OF SIGNALING SCHEMES
The goal of this paper is to highlight the role of access to strategic
signaling in creating unequal access to opportunity and explore the
intervention of a standardized test as a way to combat this inequity.
In order to do so, we first formulate optimal signaling schemes, and
then we study their impact on students and their relationship to
noisy grades.
4.1 Optimal signaling scheme
We first derive the optimal signaling scheme. The idea is to pack
low-quality students together with high quality students by giving
both the accept signal σ+. A school is limited in the extent to which
it can do so, as it must ensure the university obtains non-negative
expected utility by accepting all the students who have signal σ+.
The following theorem provides the right balance.
Theorem 5. The optimal signaling scheme for a school is
Pr
[
σ+ | д = 0
]
=
p + q − 1
q − p
Pr
[
σ+ | д = 1
]
= 1.
Proof. As per the revelation principle in Theorem 4, we can let
σ+ be a signal such that all students with that signal are accepted by
the university, and σ−
a signal such that all students with that signal
are rejected. Conditional on σ+, we can write the probabilities that
a student is of each type as
Pr[t = 1|σ+] =
Pr
[
t = 1,σ+
]
Pr [σ+]
= Pr[t = 1] ·
Pr[σ+ |t = 1]
Pr[σ+]
= Pr[t = 1] ·
Pr[σ+ |д = 1] Pr[д = 1|t = 1]
Pr[σ+]
+ Pr[t = 1] ·
Pr[σ+ |д = 0] Pr[д = 0|t = 1]
Pr[σ+]
=p ·
q Pr[σ+ |д = 1] + (1 − q) Pr[σ+ |д = 0]
Pr [σ+]
and, similarly,
Pr[t = 0|σ+] = (1 − p) ·
(1 − q) Pr[σ+ |д = 1] + q Pr[σ+ |д = 0]
Pr [σ+]
.
The university’s expected utility when accepting all those stu-
dents with signal σ+ is non-negative if and only if such a student is
at least as likely to be of type 1 as of type 0, that is, Pr[t = 0|σ+] ≤
Pr[t = 1|σ+]. Plugging in and rearranging, this gives the constraint
Pr[σ+ |д = 0] · (q(1 − p) − p(1 − q))
≤ Pr[σ+ |д = 1] · (pq − (1 − q)(1 − p)) .
Recall that q(1 − p) − p(1 − q) > 0 by Assumption 2, and thus the
constraint can be rewritten as
Pr[σ+ |д = 0] ≤
pq − (1 − q)(1 − p)
q(1 − p) − p(1 − q)
· Pr[σ+ |д = 1]
=
p + q − 1
q − p
· Pr[σ+ |д = 1].
The school’s expected utility is
Pr[σ+] = Pr[σ+ |д = 0] Pr[д = 0] + Pr[σ+ |д = 1] Pr[д = 1].
Since Pr[σ+ |д = 1] is unconstrained, the school’s utility is maxi-
mized by setting it to 1. The school’s utility is, similarly, maximized
by maximizing the value of Pr[σ+ |д = 0], which, given the con-
straint, occurs by setting
Pr[σ+ |д = 0] =
p + q − 1
q − p
· Pr[σ+ |д = 1]
=
p + q − 1
q − p
. 
4.2 School’s utility, false positive and false
negative rates
In this section, we calculate the expected utility, false positive, and
false negative rate achieved by a school, depending on the accuracy
of its grades and whether it uses the optimal strategic signaling
scheme when transmitting information about its students to the
university. These lemmas will form the basis of our evaluation of
the impacts of strategic signaling, in Section 4.3. Recall that we refer
to a school that does not strategically signal and instead transmits
its raw grades to the university as revealing.
The proofs of the following Lemmas follow by direct calculations.
We provide an exposition of the more involved calculations of
Lemmas 7 and 9 in the Appendix.
Lemma 6 (Revealing school’s utility). The expected utility
Ur (p,q) of a revealing school is
Ur (p,q) = pq + (1 − p)(1 − q).
For the special case of a revealing school with accurate grades (when
q = 1), we have
Ur (p, 1) = p.
A revealing school gets exactly the students with high grades
accepted, as per Assumption 2; in particular, a q fraction of high-
type students will have a high grade and be accepted, while a (1−q)
fraction of the low-type students will be accepted.
Lemma 7 (Strategic school’s utility). A school’s expected
utilityUs (p,q) when it signals strategically is given by
Us (p,q) = 1 + (p + q − 2pq) ·
2p − 1
q − p
.
For the special case of a strategic school with accurate grades (when
q = 1), we have
Us (p, 1) = 2p.
A school that signals strategically gets exactly those students
with a signal of σ+ accepted, as per the revelation principle argu-
ment of Theorem 4; a student with a high grade will be accepted
with probability Pr
[
σ+ | д = 1
]
and a student with a low grade with
probability Pr
[
σ+ | д = 0
]
, with the probabilities chosen according
to Theorem 5.
Lemma 8 (Revealing school’s FPR/FNR). When a school is re-
vealing, the false positive rate is given by
FPRr (p,q) = 1 − q
and the false negative rate by
FNRr (p,q) = 1 − q.
For the special case of a revealing school with accurate grades (when
q = 1), we have FPRr (p, 1) = FNRr (p, 1) = 0.
In the case of a revealing school, a low-type (resp. high-type)
student obtains a low (resp. high) grade and gets rejected (resp.
accepted) with probability 1 − q, i.e., if the grade does not match
the type.
Lemma 9 (Strategic school’s FPR/FNR). When a school signals
strategically, the false positive rate is given by
FPRs (p,q) = 1 − q + q ·
p + q − 1
q − p
and the false negative rate by
FNRs (p,q) = (1 − q)
1 − 2p
q − p
.
For the special case of a strategic school with accurate grades (when
q = 1), we have FPRs (p, 1) =
p
1−p and FNRs (p, 1) = 0.
In the case of a school that signals strategically according to
Theorem 5, a low-type student gets accepted with probability
Pr
[
σ+ | д = 1
]
= 1 if his grade is 1 (which occurs with probability
1 − q), and probability Pr
[
σ+ | д = 0
]
if his grade is д = 0 (which
occurs with probability q). On the other hand, a high-type student
gets rejected when his signal is σ−
; because Pr
[
σ+ | д = 1
]
= 1, this
happens only when д = 0 and the signal is σ−
, i.e. with probability
Pr [σ− | д = 0] Pr[д = 0|t = 1].
Remark. While we chose to focus on average population (i.e.,
school) utility in this paper, because of space constraints, one can
use these derivations of FRP and FNP to calculate the welfare of
subpopulations, such as low-type students at a revealing school,
which then implies population-level utility comparisons as well.
One interesting observation is that, using the above Lemmas and
Assumptions 1 and 2, one can see that the FPR of a strategic school
is larger and the FNR smaller than that of a revealing school. Thus,
while it is intuitively obvious that low-type students prefer a strate-
gic school, these calculations show that high-type students also
prefer a strategic school (and the preference is strict unless the
assumptions hold with equality).
4.3 Consequences of strategic signaling for
access to opportunity
In this section, we quantify the impact of access to strategic sig-
naling and its interaction with accuracy of the information (grades)
on which the signals are based. We study both the resulting ex-
pected utility of a school as well as the resulting acceptance rates
of both types of students. We find that the ability to strategically
signal always has a positive (although bounded) impact, increasing
students’ acceptance rates and the school’s expected utility. The
benefit of strategic signaling for both students and the school im-
proves (boundedly so) with the accuracy of the grades, whereas a
revealing school and its students receive (potentially dramatically)
higher expected utility from noisy grades. The following theorem is
a direct consequence of Lemmas 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 in the Appendix.
Theorem 10. For all p < 1/2 and q > q′ ≥ 1 − p, the following
hold:
• accuracy in grades benefits strategic schools,
Us (p,q
′) ≥ Us (p,q) ≥ Us (p,q
′);
• strategic schools have higher expected utility than revealing
schools,
2Ur (p,q) ≥ Us (p,q) ≥ Ur (p,q);
• and accuracy in grades harms revealing schools,
2(1 − p)Ur (p,q) ≥ Ur (p,q
′) ≥ Ur (p,q).
Further, all above bounds are tight for some q,q′.
We see that, perhaps counter-intuitively, adding noise to the
grades can help a revealing school get more students admitted, up
to a point.
grade increases the number of students with a high grade over-
all, by Assumption 1, as there are more low-type students (whose
representation increases as grade accuracy decreases) than high-
type students (whose representation decreases as grade accuracy
decreases). Adding noise to grades is, however, a blunt instrument,
in that it drives up both false negatives and false positives (see
Lemma 8), which limits its utility benefits. The ability to signal
strategically is more subtle, driving up false positives (and expected
utility), at no cost of false negatives. The power of strategic sig-
naling is maximized when schools have access to highly accurate
grades. Accurate information, the ability to control the noise level
of that information, and, most notably, the ability to strategically
signal about that information, therefore constitute powerful drivers
of unequal access to opportunity in settings where key information
is transmitted to a decision-maker on behalf of a population.
We can derive comparisons resulting in similar insights for the
false positive and false negative rates of revealing and strategic
schools (see Appendix).
5 INTERVENTION: STANDARDIZED TEST
The prior sections show that unequal access to strategic signal-
ing can result in unequal access to opportunity. This is driven by
high error rates for students accepted from schools with signaling
technologies and/or noisy grades. The university has a vested in-
terested in decreasing this error rate as it harms the university’s
utility. In addition, an outside body or the university itself might
be concerned about the resulting unequal access to opportunity. In
this section, we explore the impact of a common intervention: the
standardized test. While availability of a test score certainly can
only improve the expected utility of the university,
has an ambiguous effect on the inequity. In particular, for a large
range of parameter settings, the introduction of a test can increase
the inequality in access to opportunity.
and Schwarz [35].
test scores is zero, and so can only increase. For revealing schools, the university gets
strictly more information with test scores and hence more utility.
5.1 Augmented model
Throughout this section, we augment the model of Section 3 to
add the requirement that each student must take a test, and the
results of that test are visible both to the student’s school and to
the university. (The school may then incorporate the test results
into its subsequent strategic behavior.)
Wemodel the test score si ∈ {0, 1} of student i as a noisy estimate
of ti , conditionally independent from the grade дi , obtained as
follows: Pr[si = 0|ti = 0] = Pr[si = 1|ti = 1] = δ , for δ ∈ [1/2, 1].8
The score si is public, i.e., the school and the university both observe
it.
A school has access to a set of signals Σ as before, but now can
design a signaling scheme σ : {0, 1} × {0, 1} → ∆(Σ) that is a
function of both the student’s grade and his test score; i.e., the
school designs Pr [σ | дi , si ] for σ ∈ Σ. The university again makes
accept/reject decisions that maximize its expected utility, but now
the university has access to the test score si and its distribution δ as
well as the signal and the distributions p and q. As before, a strategic
school chooses a signaling scheme that maximizes the fraction of
students accepted whereas a revealing school simply transmits the
grade to the university as the signal.
As in Section 3, we introduce an assumption controlling the
noise δ of the test.
Assumption 11. The university has non-negative expected utility
for accepting a student with a high test score, and negative expected
utility for accepting a student with a low test score:
0 ≤ pδ − (1 − p)(1 − δ )
0 > p(1 − δ ) − (1 − p)δ .
We note that if the expected utility of accepting a student with a
high test score were negative, or the expected utility of accepting
a student with a low test score were positive, then in the absence
of signals, the university would always accept either none or all of
the students. Note that regimes when the standardized test is unin-
formative on its own but becomes informative when coupled with
grades may still be interesting. However, even under Assumption 11,
which excludes certain parameter ranges from consideration, we
have a rich enough model to illustrate our main findings. In the
Appendix, we show how to relax this assumption, and how doing
so affects the optimal signaling scheme.
The following consequence will be useful in our analysis.
Observation 12. Under Assumption 1, Assumption 11 implies
δ ≥ 1 − p.
Fixing p, we denote by uq,δ (д, s) the expected utility the uni-
versity derives from admitting a student with score s and grade
д:
uq,δ (д, s) := Pr[ti = 1| д, s] − Pr[ti = 0| д, s].
When δ = q = 1, uq,δ (s,д) is not defined for s , д as in this case
s and д are perfectly correlated. For notational convenience, we
define uq,δ (s,д) = −1 in these cases.
without loss of generality.
Lemma 13. Assumptions 2 and 11 together imply that the univer-
sity receives non-negative expected utility from accepting a student
with both a high grade and a high score, and negative expected utility
from a student with both a low grade and a low score:
uq,δ (1, 1) ≥ 0 > uq,δ (0, 0).
This can be rewritten as
pqδ − (1 − p)(1 − q)(1 − δ ) ≥ 0;
p(1 − q)(1 − δ ) − (1 − p)qδ < 0.
Theorem 4 (the revelation principle) also holds in this setting, and
so we assume for the remainder of this section that Σ = {σ−,σ+},
without loss of generality.
5.2 Optimal signaling
We first derive the optimal strategic signaling scheme. Again, a
school would like to pack low-quality students together with high
quality students, but is now limited in its ability to do so by their test
scores. If the expected utility the university receives from a student
with a high grade but low test score is negative (uq,δ (1, 0) < 0),
then this student (and in fact any student with a low test score)
will be rejected regardless of the signal from the school. Otherwise
(uq,δ (1, 0) ≥ 0), the school can signal to the university to accept
such a student, and can additionally pack in some low-grade-low-
score students, subject to maintaining non-negative expected utility
for the university.
Theorem 14. The optimal signaling scheme for a school with
access to grades and a test score, under Assumption 11, is
Pr
[
σ+ | д = 1, s = 1
]
= 1
Pr
[
σ+ | д = 0, s = 1
]
= 1
Pr
[
σ+ | д = 1, s = 0
]
=
{
1, if uq,δ (1, 0) ≥ 0
0, if uq,δ (1, 0) < 0
Pr
[
σ+ | д = 0, s = 0
]
=
{ pq(1−δ )−(1−p)(1−q)δ
(1−p)qδ−p(1−q)(1−δ ) , if uq,δ (1, 0) ≥ 0
0, if uq,δ (1, 0) < 0
We defer the proof to the Appendix.
5.3 School’s utility, false positive and false
negative rates
In this section, we calculate the expected utility achieved by both
a strategic school and a revealing school as a function of the type
distribution, the accuracy of its grades, and the accuracy of the
standardized test score. We defer all proofs to the Appendix.
For a revealing school, the university always accepts high-grade
high-score students. If high grades are more informative than low
test scores (that is, if uq,δ (1, 0) ≥ 0, which depends on p as well
as q and δ and happens, for instance, if p = 1/4, q = 9/10, and
δ = 7/10), then the university also accepts students with low test
scores, benefiting the school. Alternatively, if high test scores are
more informative than low grades (i.e., uq,δ (0, 1) ≥ 0), then the
university also accepts students with low grades. These conditions
provide additional boosts to the utility of a revealing school.
Lemma 15 (Revealing school’s utility). The expected utility
Ur (p,q,δ ) of a revealing school with access to grades and a test score
is
Ur (p,q,δ ) = pqδ + (1 − p)(1 − q)(1 − δ )
+ 1
[
uq,δ (1, 0) ≥ 0
]
(pq(1 − δ ) + (1 − p)(1 − q)δ )
+ 1
[
uq,δ (0, 1) ≥ 0
]
(p(1 − q)δ + (1 − p)q(1 − δ )) .
For the special case of a revealing school with accurate grades (when
q = 1), we have
Ur (p, 1,δ ) = p.
As illustrated in Figure 1, for fixed p and δ , Ur (p,q,δ ) may not
be a decreasing function of q. In fact, when q is small enough, the
grades are completely uninformative and the university only admits
students with a test score of 1. In that regime, the expected utility
for a revealing school is therefore constant in q. For intermediate
values of q, the grades are still uninformative on their own but are
informative coupled with a high standardized test score; at this
point, only students with both a score and a grade of 1 get admitted
by the university, and the school’s expected utility suddenly drops
when compared to smaller q. The school’s expected utility in that
regime is increasing in q as, under Assumption 11, increasing the
value of q increases the fraction of students with both high scores
and high grades. Finally, when q is large enough, the grades are
significant enough on their own that only students with high grades
are admitted; this leads to a jump in expected utility compared to
the intermediate regime. In this regime for high values of q, the
school’s expected utility is decreasing as a result of the fact that
increasing the value of q now decreases the number of students
with a high grade by Assumption 1, as seen in Section 4.3.
Lemma 16 (Strategic school’s utility). The expected utility
Us (p,q) when a school signals strategically and uq,δ (1, 0) < 0 is
Us (p,q,δ ) = pδ + (1 − p)(1 − δ );
when uq,δ (1, 0) ≥ 0, the expected utility is
Us (p,q,δ ) = (1 − p(1 − q)(1 − δ ) − (1 − p)qδ )
+ (p(1 − q)(1 − δ ) + (1 − p)qδ )
pq(1 − δ ) − (1 − p)(1 − q)δ
(1 − p)qδ − p(1 − q)(1 − δ )
.
For the special case of a strategic school with accurate grades (when
q = 1), we have
Us (p, 1,δ ) = 1 − δ + p.
The expected utility of a strategic school is, unsurprisingly, mono-
tone in q (as illustrated in Figure 1), as higher-quality information
about its students’ types allows the school to signal more effectively.
For small and intermediate values of q (i.e., insignificant grades),
the university bases admission decisions solely on the standardized
test score and only admits students with a score of 1 (it has positive
expected utility from doing so, by Assumption 11); in this regime,
a strategic school’s expected utility is hence constant. When q be-
comes large enough, i.e., when the grades are significant enough,
the university starts having positive expected utility from admitting
students with a high grade even if they have a low score, and the
school can start bundling these students together with the high
score students, leading to a jump in its expected utility. The plotted
parameters for the figures are chosen to satisfy Assumptions 1, 2
and 11; the discontinuities occur at q such that uq,δ (0, 1) = 0 and
uq,δ (1, 0) = 0.
We also calculate the false positive and false negative rates of
strategic and revealing schools; we defer this derivation to the
Appendix.
5.4 Impact of Standardized Test
With a perfect standardized test or, in fact, a sufficiently good
one, (i.e., high enough δ ), it is not hard to see that the university
accepts exactly those students with a high test score from strategic
as well as revealing schools. Thus, no matter the accuracy of the
grades or distribution of types, the standardized test results in
equal expected utility, and hence equal access to opportunity, for
revealing and strategic schools (see Appendix for details). Similarly,
if grades are accurate (i.e., q = 1), then a revealing school’s expected
utility is fixed at p whereas a strategic school’s expected utility is
only diminished (from 2p without the test) by the extra constraints
introduced by a standardized test. Thus, in this case as well, a
standardized test decreases the inequality between the utilities of a
strategic and a revealing school, making the ratio of utilities less
than 2 (see Appendix for details).
Figure 2 plots Us (p,q)/Ur (p,q), with and without test scores, as
a function of q, for p = 0.35 and different values of δ . The form
of the utility ratio between a strategic and a revealing school in
the absence of a test score follows from the fact that both utilities
are continuous, and that the expected utility of a strategic school
increases while that of a revealing school decreases in q, as we have
seen in Section 4.3. The form in the presence of a test score can be
explained as follows. First, when in the regime of small values of q,
only students with a high standardized test score are admitted by
the university, in which case admission decisions do not depend on
how the schools act and both the strategic school and the revealing
school have the same expected utility, leading to a ratio of 1. For
intermediate values of q, we have previously discussed that the util-
ity for a strategic school remains constant (the university still has
positive utility for students with a score of 1 and the strategic school
can bundle all such students together, regardless of grade), while
the utility for a revealing school suddenly drops (only students with
both a high grade and a high score are admitted) and is increasing
in q, explaining the sudden drop in ratio of utilities at the change of
regime, and the decreasing monotonicity of the ratio in q within the
intermediate regime. When q becomes large enough, we have seen
that both the revealing and the strategic school experience a jump
in utilities, which explains the second discontinuity in the ratio
of utilities. Because the revealing school has significantly lower
utility than the strategic school for intermediate values of q, the
relative jump in the utility of a revealing school is higher than the
relative jump in utility of a strategic school. Because in the regime
with high values of q, the utility of a strategic school is increasing
and that of a revealing school is decreasing, the ratio of utilities is
increasing.
Interestingly, we observe that the introduction of a standardized
test does not always decrease inequity. For noisy grades, when the
test score is also sufficiently noisy, the test may have the effect of
increasing the ratio of utilities between a strategic school and a
revealing school. This is clearly illustrated in Figure 2, where the
curve with test scores sometimes lies above that without a test.
Some intuition for this result is as follows. In the regime for in-
termediate values of q, as q becomes more and more inaccurate,
the ratio of utilities in the presence of a standardized test increases
and eventually overtakes the ratio in the absence of a standardized
test (which decreases to 1 as the grades become more inaccurate).
In the regime for high values of q, the university admits students
with a high grade only, independently of what their standardized
test scores are; therefore, the utility of a revealing school is the
same with or without a standardized test. On the other hand, when
the standardized test score becomes more inaccurate, the strategic
school can take advantage of the noise in said score to bundle in
more students than if there was no standardized test: the univer-
sity loses in utility from accepting unqualified students with high
scores, but at the same time gains in utility from accepting qualified
students with low scores, allowing a strategic school to bundle
more students when compared to the case with no standardized
test. As δ decreases and the standardized test becomes less and less
accurate, a strategic school starts losing fewer high-score students
to rejection than it gains in admitted low-score students, and its
utility increases.
6 FURTHER DISCUSSION AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
Our paper, in introducing the study of inequity induced by population-
level signaling, raises a number of directions for future work. We
discuss a few of them here.
First, one might be interested in enriching the model of the stan-
dardized test intervention. For example, there could be asymmetries
in how students from different schools perform on the standard-
ized test. One might imagine students at an advantaged school
might be better prepared for the test (e.g., by investment in ex-
pensive test-prep courses), giving them an edge in the form of an
increased probability of performing well on the test. Suppose, for
example, that high-type students in an advantaged school had a
higher probability of passing the test than high-type students at a
disadvantaged school. In such a situation, more high-type students
from the advantaged school would be admitted by the university,
and, as the utility for the university to accept high score students
increased, the advantaged school could also bundle a larger number
of low-type students with its high-type students. That is, a jump
in high-types’ exam performance increases students’ utilities at
that school, even for low types; this effect could further exacer-
bate disparities between and an advantaged and a disadvantaged
school. An interesting question could be to quantify how much
disparities between schools would increase in such a setting. One
could also analyze other variants of advantage on the exam, such
as an increased probability of passing both for high-types and for
low-types.
One might also imagine that students in an advantaged school
might have access to more resources and could take the standard-
ized test several times, while students in a disadvantaged school
could only take the test once. When only the highest test score is
reported to the university (as is common in practice for university
admissions in the United States), it can be seen that this reduces to
the situation described above, in which students in each school take
the standardized test exactly once, but students in the advantaged
school have a higher probability of passing. An extreme case of such
a situation would be when the advantaged school’s students could
take the test enough times that they would pass with a probability
approaching 1; in such a case, a test score from the advantaged
school would be meaningless to the university. On the other hand,
the test would still be significant for the disadvantaged school, and
could have the effect of reducing the number of its students that are
accepted, further increasing disparities between schools. A natural
question would be to quantify such disparities for intermediate
values of the number of times that an advantaged-school student
can take the standardized test.
Finally, throughout the paper, we assume that the university
has unlimited capacity and is willing to accept every student that
provides it with non-negative expected utility. One might ask what
would happen if the university had a limited capacity. The univer-
sity might then rank students as a function of their school of origin,
their signal, and their test score (in the presence of a standardized
test), and only accepted the highest-ranked students. If an advan-
taged school had the ability to make its students look better than
a disadvantaged school (for example, an advantaged school might
have more accurate grades and have a higher ability to strategically
signal), then the advantaged school could guarantee that some of
its students would get first pick by the university, to the detriment
of a disadvantaged school—which would only have access to the
(possibly small) remaining capacity. A natural direction would be
to understand how much of an effect this limited capacity setting
can have on inequity.
