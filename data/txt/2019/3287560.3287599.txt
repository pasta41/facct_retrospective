ABSTRACT
The study of fairness in intelligent decision systems has mostly
ignored long-term influence on the underlying population. Yet fair-
ness considerations (e.g. affirmative action) have often the implicit
goal of achieving balance among groups within the population. The
most basic notion of balance is eventual equality between the quali-
fications of the groups. How can we incorporate influence dynamics
in decision making? How well do dynamics-oblivious fairness poli-
cies fare in terms of reaching equality? In this paper, we propose a
simple yet revealing model that encompasses (1) a selection process
where an institution chooses from multiple groups according to
their qualifications so as to maximize an institutional utility and (2)
dynamics that govern the evolution of the groups’ qualifications
according to the imposed policies. We focus on demographic parity
as the formalism of affirmative action.
We first give conditions under which an unconstrained policy
reaches equality on its own. In this case, surprisingly, imposing
demographic parity may break equality. When it doesn’t, one would
expect the additional constraint to reduce utility, however, we show
that utility may in fact increase. In real world scenarios, uncon-
strained policies do not lead to equality. In such cases, we show
that although imposing demographic parity may remedy it, there
is a danger that groups settle at a worse set of qualifications. As a
silver lining, we also identify when the constraint not only leads to
equality, but also improves all groups. These cases and trade-offs
are instrumental in determining when and how imposing demo-
graphic parity can be beneficial in selection processes, both for the
institution and for society on the long run.

1 INTRODUCTION
As many aspects of human society become increasingly automated,
questions of ethical nature migrate into the technological sphere.
Admittedly, no amount of formalization can capture all the complex-
ity and subtlety of these issues. Yet, one is compelled tomathematize
them and integrate them with familiar frameworks. The result of
this process is the design of purportedly ethically-minded technol-
ogy. An important component of this process, then, is to understand
just how well such technology interacts with society and whether
its use does indeed result in the intended effect.
Automated decision and policy making, particularly the data-
driven case embodied by machine learning, is one such technology
that has recently alloted considerable attention to these ethical
questions. In particular, guaranteeing non-discriminatory behavior
has been at the forefront of research. Various formalizations of non-
discrimination have been proposed, relationships between these
notions have been studied [6, 9], and fundamental trade-offs have
been identified [15]. Yet the influence of the resulting decision
systems on society has only garnered modest treatment [17]. One
place where this question has been thoroughly considered is in
studying the evolution of negative stereotypes in labor markets, in
economics [5, 12]. The dynamics there, however, are very carefully
crafted to mimic the labor market. To relate the formalism of the
current paper with these prior work, see Section 2.
This paper starts by proposing a selection process where an
institution chooses from multiple groups according to their quali-
fications so as to maximize an institutional utility. In this context,
non-discrimination often takes the form of constraining the type
of selection policies. Demographic parity, for example, enforces
groups to have equal selection rates. This is a simple yet rich model
that has been well studied [9] [15], and as such this paper chooses it
as the archetype of non-discrimination, referring to it with the more
colloquial name of affirmative action (AA). But non-discrimination
is rarely a goal in and of itself. Ultimately, one tacitly expects a
benefit to society. What kind of expected benefit is implicit in AA?
The fact that a fully transformed society does not require non-
discrimination hints at a possible answer. This is in particular true
if the groups themselves are indistinguishable. If one accepts that
such social equality is the intended effect of non-discrimination,
then the question becomes: does AA lead to it? To answer this,
modeling how the populations change in response to policies is
not simply a luxury, but a necessity. This paper starts with some
natural tenets, and derives from them a model of dynamics that
govern the evolution of the groups’ qualifications according to the
imposed policies. These dynamics are general enough to model
behavior beyond the specific ones in prior work.
The paper then proceeds by first giving conditions under which
an unconstrained policy reaches equality on its own. In this case,
surprisingly, imposing AAmay break equality. When it doesn’t, one
would expect the additional constraint to reduce utility, however,
it can be shown that utility may in fact increase. In practice, AA
acts in two possible ways. Either selection rates of the privileged
are reduced or those of the underprivileged are increased [7]. This
dichotomy is at the heart of the starkly different ways in which
non-discrimination manifests itself. In real world scenarios, un-
constrained policies do not lead to equality. In such cases, it can
be shown that although imposing AA may remedy it, there is a
danger that groups settle at a worse set of qualifications. As a silver
lining, one can identify exactly when the constraint not only leads
to equality, but also improves all groups.
To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows:
• A simple yet flexible model for both a selection process by
an institution and dynamics describing the change in the
population due to selection policies
• A characterization of the policies resulting from institutional
utility maximization without and with imposing affirmative
action as non-discrimination
• Conditions under which society equalizes for each type of
policy, along with the impact on the long-term institutional
utility
These cases and trade-offs are instrumental in determining when
and how imposing demographic parity can be beneficial in selection
processes, both for the institution and for society on the long run.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 covers
the most relevant related work. Section 3 formulates the problem
and establishes the models. Section 4 derives the policies that arise
from the models and characterizes the conditions under which they
lead to social equality. Sections 6 and 7 study the contrast between
imposing affirmative action or not, in the case when not imposing it
naturally leads to equality or not, respectively. Section 8 concludes.
2 RELATEDWORK
On the economics side, a large literature exists examining statistical
discrimination, dating back to Arrow [2]. Prior work has attempted
to study the effect of affirmative action in the labor market to
remove stereotypes [3, 5, 8, 12, 18], where stereotypes are defined
as misrepresenting the quality of a worker from a disadvantaged
group, when groups are assumed to be ex-ante equal. The models
of [5] and [12] are the most related to the present work: they both
set up a game in a market between workers and employers, where
workers have the choice to invest in themselves to become qualified,
and emit a test signal that employers threshold as their policy. The
dynamics that this game generates on the distribution of qualified
individuals per group is very specific. In particular, it is restricted to
be unimodal. Both papers look at sufficient conditions for equality
and propose interventions to actively reach it. The current paper
trades off the concreteness of this line of work for more domain
generality, through less specific dynamics. This helps garner more
insight about the fundamental interplay between the constraints
and changes in society. Moreover, examining dynamics and tracking
the populations through time instead of only looking at equilibria
as in [8, 18], allows comparing cumulative utility which plays a
role in short term considerations.
A recent work [17] raised very similar questions to the ones
considered here. Themain difference in that setup is that individuals
are characterized by a potentially non-binary score and are studied
over only a single step of the selection process. The influence of
the selection is modeled by a social utility function ∆ that can
be interpreted as the expected change in score for an individual
due to selection. The authors do not suggest that this change is
due to population shifts, though it could be. Without tailoring ∆
specifically to have such an interpretation, it is not possible to
track distributions of scores over long time horizons. The dynamics
proposed here implements precisely that aspect and enables the
study of both institutional utility and social equality that emerge
from fairness constraints. Another somewhat related work is that
of [10], which models the retention rate of users of a particular
service as a function of that service’s quality. There, this is thought
of as the error of a learning algorithm and the authors propose
a robust learning approach to avoid amplifying the difference in
retention rate by group.
The present formulation also bears some similarity to reinforce-
ment learning due to the dynamics being essentially Markovian.
As such, it can be thought of as an optimal control problem. The
goal here however is to analyze policies that are unaware of the
dynamics, and do not make an explicit effort to learn it. Also, the
focus is not simply on utility, but the secondary objective of social
equality too. Previous work [13] has explored fairness with learning,
guaranteeing that actions are preferentially selected only if they
effectively generate more reward. However, there are many key
differences, such as the state and action space in the current model
being continuous as opposed to the discrete versions treated in
[13] and having deterministic transitions. Work in online decision
making [14] has also explored fairness constraints, but in a bandit
setting that lacks the dynamical aspect.
3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
3.1 Society: groups, qualification profiles
Throughout this paper, the total population is divided into two
groups indexed by the variableG: group G = A which constitutes
the дA fraction and group G = B the дB = 1 − дA fraction. The
limitation to only two groups simplifies the exposition yetmaintains
the essence of the problem.
One can conceptually think of each individual in either group as
having some attribute θ ∈ Θ that bears information about qualifi-
cation. For example in a college admission scenario the attribute
θ can be: [GPA, SAT, Letters of recommendation]. This attribute is
thought to provide a complete description in this context. In what
follows, θ is implicitly mapped through an estimator F : θ → {0, 1}
to a crisp evaluation of qualification: say v = 1 if qualified and
v = 0 otherwise. The assumption is that this binary classification
is sufficient to characterize the utility that the individual would
bring. This is compatible with the work on statistical discrimination
[5, 12]. An alternative way to reach this model is to first consider
a more general multiclass characterization and then show that a
; ;

subgroups of the population have each publicly known
qualification profiles π . An institution performs a selec-
tion by maximizing utility U , possibly subject to a non-
discrimination constraint. The selection policies τ influence
the profiles at the next round, through dynamics f .
threshold policy is optimal with respect to utility and societal im-
provement, as was done in [17]. This again indicates that a binary
characterization, i.e. above and below the threshold, is often suf-
ficient. For the example of admissions, one can think of v = 1 as
indicating an individual likely to be successful in college.
Let the distribution of evaluations V = v in group G = j be de-
noted by π (·|G = j). This probability distribution is the qualification
profile of groupG = j . Instead of tracking individuals, it is more nat-
ural to study changes in the population in terms of the qualification
profiles of groups. For example, in college admissions it is not the
same students that would change their qualifications in response
to admission policies, but rather those of the next application cycle.
3.2 Institution: policy, utility, selection rates
The population undergoes a selection process. An institution, re-
ferred to also by policy maker, designs a policy τ (V = v;G = j):
{0, 1} × {A,B} → [0, 1] that maps each individual to a probability
of selection, possibly depending on the group identity. The insti-
tution also places a utility on each possible evaluation v , through
a map u : {0, 1} → R, v 7→ u(v). Since v = 1 and v = 0 are as-
sumed to be beneficial and detrimental respectively, and to avoid
trivial policies where none/all are selected in what follows, assume
u(0) ≤ 0 ≤ u(1). The (average) institutional utility of a policy can
then be defined as follows:
U (τ ) =
∑
j ∈{A,B }
дj
∑
v ∈{0,1}
u(v) · τ (V = v ;G = j) · π (v |G = j). (1)
Any given policy also defines (per group) selection rates: β(G =
j) = ∑
v ∈{0,1} τ (V = v;G = j) · π (V = v |G = j). For college
admission, this corresponds to acceptance rates per group. Note
that each term in the sum is the rate corresponding to a particular
evaluation. Denote these by β(V = v;G = j) = τ (V = v;G =
j) · π (V = v |G = j). In what follows, for notational convenience,
the explicit ’V =’ and ‘G =’ are dropped from the expressions of the
qualification profiles, policies, and selection rates, since the context
of the argument is clear.
3.3 Influence Dynamics
The execution of a selection policy can be thought of as demarcating
time t . The main premise of this paper is that the selection process
affects the population, namely by changing the qualification profiles
of either group at time t + 1. This change can be interpreted in
different ways. It could be due to genuine change within society: the
institutions’ policies can then be thought of as having a secondary
effect as social incentive or deterrent. But change could also be due
to self-selection in the pool of individuals available to the institution
on the next time step: policies then have the effect of filtering
through time, possibly without society itself changing. Although
the model is not specific to an interpretation, when the perspective
moves to social equality in Section 4, the tacit assumption is that
dynamics are due to genuine change.
Dynamics are in general very complicated. They may vary in
time, be stochastic, and depend on many parameters of the prob-
lem. Some of these aspects, however, are more relevant than others
for capturing the fundamental effects. In what follows, dynamics
are taken to be time-invariant and deterministic. Time-invariance
is a convenient assumption, which can be supported by the slow
change in the way in which society responds to stimuli. Determin-
ism does not mean that there is no stochasticity within society,
but that any such change is summarized through the evolution of
the qualifications. Moreover, one can interpret these deterministic
dynamics as the expectation of a more general stochastic dynamics.
As such it is a Markovian assumption, with the state consisting of
the qualification profiles.
Finally, what parameters of the problem should govern change
and in what manner should they do so? There are three tenets that
lead to this paper’s proposal:
(a) Within each group, there is an (a priori) distribution of po-
tential qualifications, identical to the qualification profiles at
the previous time step.
(b) Upon observing the previous time step’s policy, individuals
respond by instantiating with some probability as (a posteri-
ori) qualified or unqualified.
(c) The response probabilities, which summarize how policies
influence individuals, depend only on the selection rates
within the group of the individual and their potential quali-
fication.
Tenet (a) describes society’s inertia in the absence of influencing
policies. Tenet (b) could be thought of as a result of adequate or
lacking individual effort in response to policies. In tenet (c), the
fact that potentially qualified and potentially unqualified individ-
uals may be influenced differently is necessary for the history of
qualifications to have relevance. The main restriction thus is that
the only influence of policies is through selection rates within a
group. Lack of influence across groups is an idealization of such
influence arguably being weaker than within a group. As for selec-
tion rates being the key variable rather than the selection policy
itself, one can motivate it by considering extremes: indeed, if no
qualified (or unqualified) individuals exist then selection policy for
qualified (or unqualified) individuals is never observed and cannot
have influence.
With these tenets, dynamics induced by the influence of policies
can be defined as follows.
Assumption 3.1 (Dynamics). For a given group j , let πt (1|j) =:
πt (1) (the group index dropped here and later, for clarity) denote
the qualification profile of group j for v = 1 at time t and let the
policies τt at that time step induce the selection rates βt . Then the
qualification profiles at time t + 1 are given by
πt+1(1) = πt (1) f1
(
βt (0), βt (1)
)
+ πt (0) f0
(
βt (0), βt (1)
)
(2)
where f0 and f1 are two arbitrary continuously differentiable func-
tions [0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1]. The pair (f0, f1) is referred to as the
dynamics.
These dynamics make the tenets concrete. For each groupG = j ,
πt (·|j) describes the potential qualification profile. The function
f1 represents the retention at the top: the rate of retention of the
sub-population with potential v = 1 due to the current policy. The
function f0 represents change for the better : the fraction of the
potentialv = 0 sub-population that progresses to have evaluation 1.
Equivalently, one can pair these with their counterparts to describe
full conditional distributions. The pair 1 − f1 (change for the worse)
and f1 are the conditional distribution describing the response of
an individual with potential v = 1 into actual evaluations 0 or 1
respectively, while the pair 1 − f0 (retention at the bottom) and f0
are the same respectively for an individual with potential v = 0.
It is worth making a couple of remarks about these dynamics.
First, the two groups’ responses are identical since the choice of f1
and f0 does not depend on the group. To justify this, note that in
fairness considerations such as demographic parity one makes the
inherent assumption that the groups are ex-ante equal in all respect
except for their qualification profiles, as otherwise there may be
other reasons to treat them differently based only on their identity.
Second, the groups do not interact through the functional form
of the dynamics. Differences between groups and any potential
coupling between groups can only happen through the different
and interacting selection rates induced by the policies.
Finally, leaving f0 and f1 entirely arbitrary is good for generality
but may lead to esoteric behavior. It may be more reasonable to to
restrict them in certain natural ways. One assumption to make, for
example, is that change is harder than retention.
Assumption 3.2 (Status quo bias). For all x ,y ∈ [0, 1]:
f1(x ,y) ≥ f0(x ,y).
3.4 Utility Maximization and
Non-discrimination
The primary tendency of the institution is to maximize its average
utility. Rarely, if ever, are institutions aware of the underlying dy-
namics. Thus dynamics-oblivious policies are the appropriate ones,
where the utility is maximized over a single time step. Next, two
approaches taken in practice are modeled: unconstrained maximiza-
tion without any non-discrimination considerations and affirmative
action via demographic parity.
3.4.1 Unconstrained. In the simplest of settings, institutional
utility maximization amounts to solving the following linear pro-
gram (LP) at every time step t :
max
τ
Ut (τ ), (3)
whereUt is as in (1), with all quantities defined at time step t .
3.4.2 Affirmative Action. If the evaluation v is perfect, then the
unconstrained policy is trivially identity blind, thus one could argue
that it is fair in the sense of equalized opportunity [9]. However,
as distributions of qualified individuals differ per group, the policy
will have different selection rates per group. Affirmative action
(AA), at an intuitive level, attempts to bridge such inequalities
between different groups.More precisely, AA forces equal aggregate
selection rates between groups [5, 12], and it is more formally
known as demographic parity [4, 17]. This paper adheres to this as
the archetype of non-discrimination.
Definition 3.3 (Affirmative Action). The affirmative action con-
straint forces the policy to select at an equal rate between both
groups:
β(A) = β(B) . (4)
Thus in this case, the policy maker solves (3) with the additional
constraint (4). Since the constraint is linear in τ , the optimal policy
is also found via a LP. This is elaborated in Section 4.
4 ROAD TO EQUALITY
With the models of selection process, dynamics, and affirmative
action in place, one can now ask the main question: when and how
can resulting policies lead to social equality? Perhaps the simplest
notion of equality within the population can be defined as the
groups becoming indistinguishable in their qualification profiles.
This is formalized as follows.
Definition 4.1 (Social Equality). Under given dynamics (f0, f1), a
policy is said to be equalizing if for all starting π0(1|A) and π0(1|B)
lim
t→∞
|πt (1|A) − πt (1|B)| = 0
When this happens, say that the policy/population reaches equality,
which is understood to be in an asymptotic sense.
This section characterizes the policies that result in both the
unconstrained and affirmative action settings, and studies the rela-
tionships between these policies and the conditions under which
they become equalizing.
4.1 Unconstrained
4.1.1 Resulting policy. First consider the case when the insti-
tution does not impose non-discrimination, that is the utility is
maximized as in (3) without further constraints. Denote this case
by UN. It is then straightforward to see that the optimal policies
are τt (1; ·) = 1 and τt (0; ·) = 0 for all time t .
Note that the policy only depends on the distribution at time t .
Any dynamics for group j is thus simply of the form:
πt+1(1|j) = f (πt (1|j)),
where f is defined in terms of (f0, f1) according to Equation (2) as:
f (π ) = π f1(0,π ) + (1 − π )f0(0,π ).
For convenience denote the t th iterate of f by by f t .
4.1.2 Condition for equality. Can an unconstrained policy be
equalizing? The following result from classical stability analysis,
proved for completeness in Appendix A, characterizes exactly when
this is possible.
Proposition 4.2. Dynamics of πt+1 = f (πt ) are equalizing if
and only if f has a unique globally attracting equilibrium point.
Thus under the unconstrained policy, the dynamics f must have
a unique attracting equilibrium point πe . It is worth noting that
if f has an attracting point from all but a finite number of points,
then these must be unstable fixed points of f . A point π ′
is an
unstable fixed point if f (π ′) = π ′
yet for all π0 , π ′
and all
small enough ϵ > 0, for large enough t (depending on π0 and ϵ)
| f t (π0) − π ′ | > ϵ . Since in the real world any reasonable dynamics
would have noise, these unstable points won’t have an influence,
and one could alternatively assume that f has a unique stable fixed
point except at finitely many points.
If f has a globally attracting fixed point then f t converges to
πe as t → ∞, a constant function which is trivially a contractive
mapping. If this convergence is uniform, then there would be a
large enough T such that f T is contractive. One could instead
consider the following stronger condition in the form that f itself
be a contractive mapping.
Definition 4.3 (Contractivity). f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a contractive
mapping if ∃L ∈ [0, 1) such that f is L-Lipschitz: ∀x ,y ∈ [0, 1],
| f (x) − f (y)| ≤ L|x − y | . (5)
If f is differentiable, then this condition is equivalent to having
the derivative of f bounded by L on [0, 1]. By an application of the
Banach fixed-point theorem [16], this shows that the condition of
Definition 4.3 is indeed sufficient for f to have a globally attractive
fixed point. Recall the following.
Theorem 4.4. (Banach fixed-point theorem) Let (X ,d) be a non-
empty complete metric space and let f : X → X be a contractive
mapping. Then f admits a unique fixed-point xe ∈ X where xe can
be found by choosing any arbitrary element x0 ∈ X and iterating the
function f , i.e. define xt = f t (x0), then xt → xe .
To stress again, contractivity is not a necessary condition to
reach equality, but it is a simple condition to place on the dynamics
that captures the intuition of reaching equality. More importantly,
since the dynamics are defined in terms of the functions f0 and
f1, it is more useful to give conditions on the latter to obtain a
contractive f . For π and π ′
such that π − π ′ = ∆ > 0, rewrite the
requirement that | f (π ) − f (π ′)| ≤ L · ∆ for L ∈ [0, 1) as:
| f (π ) − f (π ′)| = | π f1(0,π ) + f0(0,π ) − π f0(0,π )
− (π ′ f1(0,π ′) + f0(0,π ′) − π ′ f0(0,π ′))

= | π (f1(0,π ) − f1(0,π − ∆))
+ (1 − π )(f0(0,π ) − f0(0,π − ∆))
+∆(f1(0,π − ∆) − f0(0,π − ∆)) < L | (6)
A first step is to take both f1 and f0 to be Lipschitz.
Assumption 4.5. f1 and f0 are ℓ1 Lipschitz continuous with con-
stants L1 and L0 respectively. That is ∀x1,x2,y1,y2 ∈ [0, 1]:
| f1(x1,x2) − f1(y1,y2)| ≤ L1(|x1 − y1 | + |x2 − y2 |)
and
| f0(x1,x2) − f0(y1,y2)| ≤ L0(|x1 − y1 | + |x2 − y2 |) .
This assumption is reasonable as one would expect the jump in
the rate of retention (f1) or rate of change (f0) to be bounded as a
function of the jump in the selection rates. But looking at Equation
(6), it is not sufficient. How large should L0 and L1 be?
| f (π ) − f (π ′)|
≤ |π (f1(0,π ) − f1(0,π − ∆))|
+ |(1 − π )(f0(0,π ) − f0(0,π − ∆))|
+ |∆(f1(0,π − ∆) − f0(0,π − ∆))| (triangle inequality)
< ∆(πL1 + (1 − π )L0 + | f1(0,π − ∆) − f0(0,π − ∆)|) (7)
Thus a sufficient condition for f to be a contractive mapping is:
LUN := max
π ∈[0,1],∆<π
πL1+(1−π )L0+ | f1(0,π−∆)− f0(0,π−∆|) < 1
(8)
4.1.3 Speed of convergence. Contractivity is a restrictive condi-
tion but it has the obvious benefit of easily describing the rate at
which the population reaches equality. In particular, if
max
j ∈{A,B }
|π0(1|j) − πe | ≤ ∆ ,
then
|πt (1|A) − πt (1|B)| ≤ 2∆Lt .
Equality is reached at a linear rate (in the exponent): to equalize to
within an ϵ difference, about
log ϵ/∆
log L time steps are sufficient.
4.2 Affirmative Action
4.2.1 Two resulting policies. The following characterizes the
solution of maximizing the utility as in (3) under the additional
constraint (4). The proof can be found in Appendix A.
Proposition 4.6. Assume that at time t , πt (1|j) ≥ πt (1|¬j) and
say that j is advantaged. Then the optimal policy is one of two cases,
depending only on дj , u(0), and u(1):
AA– If дju(1) + (1 − дj )u(0) ≤ 0, then
τt (1; j) = πt (1 |¬j)
πt (1 |j) , τt (0; j) = 0 (under-acceptance),
τt (1;¬j) = 1, τt (0;¬j) = 0 .
AA+ If дju(1) + (1 − дj )u(0) ≥ 0, then
τt (1; j) = 1, τt (0; j) = 0,
τt (1;¬j) = 1, τt (0;¬j) = πt (1 |j)−πt (1 |¬j)
1−πt (1 |¬j) (over-acceptance).
There are two possible cases through which affirmative action
impacts the policy, denoted by AA– and AA+. These represent two
drastically different approaches to fairness. AA– (under-acceptance)
accepts fewer qualified individuals from the advantaged group so
as to equalize the selection rates for qualified individuals between
both groups. On the other hand, AA+
(over-acceptance) accepts
unqualified individuals from the disadvantaged group in order to
equalize the aggregate selection rates. One could think of AA–
as increasing the standard for the advantaged group and as such
reducing total selection rates. As a peek at the intuition to develop,
this could possibly reduce the motivation for individuals to become
qualified. As for AA+, one could think of it as reducing the standard
for the disadvantaged group. It is not as evident whether this could
potentially increase or decrease the motivation to become qualified.
One one hand, it does present the possibility of leading to a more
qualified overall society by increasing the total selection rates and
training more unqualified people. On the other hand, selecting
unqualified corresponds to the condition of the so-called mismatch
hypothesis [21], which claims that this could actually reduce the
number of qualified individuals over time. This mismatch effect has
been amply debated in discussions on public policy with arguments
on both sides [1, 11, 21]. One perspective of the current investigation
is to understand how the dynamics tip the scales in this debate.
4.2.2 Conditions for equality. Under AA, the analysis of equality
gets complicated. This is mainly due to the fact that in Proposition
4.6 there is a specific advantaged group. If from one time step to
the next the advantage changes, the identities of the groups swap.
This in itself is not an issue, unless the swap also causes a switch
between the cases AA–
and AA+
. This last situation will not be
considered for two reasons: first, because it is too unwieldy, and
second, because it does not arise if the dynamics are slow enough,
as formalized in Section 5. The conditions for equality given here
are thus provisional on remaining in AA–
or AA+
, with swaps or
without. Here is a characterization to remain in one case at all times,
given with no proof as it follows from Proposition 4.6.
Proposition 4.7. Let Cj,t := [πt (1|j) ≥ πt (1|¬j)] be the j-advan-
tage condition. Resolving equality either way, note that C¬j,t = ¬Cj,t .
Let C−|j := [дju(1) + (1 − дj )u(0) ≤ 0] be the AA– condition under
j-advantage and let C+ |j := [дju(1) + (1 − дj )u(0) ≥ 0] = ¬C−|j be
the AA+ condition under j-advantage.
Then to remain in AA– at all times, it is necessary that for all t :
(CA,t ∧ C−|A) ∨ (CB,t ∧ C−|B ),
and in particular it suffices that C−|A ∧ C−|B . Similarly, to remain in
AA+ at all times, it is necessary that for all t :
(CA,t ∧ C+ |A) ∨ (CB,t ∧ C+ |B ),
and in particular it suffices that C+ |A ∧ C+ |B .
Another reason for the complication is because, under AA, the
dynamics for one group depends on the other group: in Proposition
4.6 there always exists one j for which the policy depends on the
qualification profiles of ¬j. The dynamics therefore have to be
tracked jointly, unlike in UN. Write
πt+1(1|A) = fA(πt (1|A),πt (1|B))
πt+1(1|B) = fB (πt (1|A),πt (1|B)) ,
where fA and fB are two components of a joint dynamics function
f : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1] × [0, 1]. These components can be written
in terms of f0 and f1 according to Equation (2) and Proposition 4.6,
but have a complicated expression that accounts for all four cases
(who is advantaged and which AA case it is). Nevertheless, one
could say that given dynamics of this form, equality will be reached
if as t → ∞
f tA(π0(1|B),π0(1|A)) − f tB (π0(1|B),π0(1|A))
 → 0, for
all π0(1|A) and π0(1|B).
Similarly to the unconstrained case, since this would otherwise
give no guarantees on the speed of convergence, one can require f
to satisfy the following contraction condition. There exists L ∈ [0, 1)
such that f satisfies:
| fA(π ,π ′) − fB (π ,π ′)| ≤ L|π − π ′ | ∀π ,π ′ ∈ [0, 1] (9)
This does not quite fit the classical Banach fixed-point theorem,
but it is easy to show sufficiency. That is, if the dynamics satisfy
this condition then the population will reach equality. Indeed, let
π0,π
′
| fA(π0,π ′
| fA(π1,π ′
...
| fA(πt−1,π ′
t−1) − fB (πt−1,π ′
t−1)| ≤ Lt |π0 − π ′
SinceL < 1 and |π0−π ′
t−1)−
fB (πt−1,π ′
t−1)| ≥ 0 ∀t therefore limt→∞ | fA(πt ,π ′
t )−fB (πt ,π ′
t )| =
0 and the population will reach equality.
As in the unconstrained case, this contractivity requirement on
f can be reduced to sufficient conditions on f0 and f1.
Proposition 4.8. Assume that AA– holds at all times, by the
necessary or sufficient conditions of Proposition 4.7. Then if
LAA– := max
π ∈[0,1]
| f1(0,π ) − f0(0,π )| < 1 (10)
holds, then society equalizes.
Proposition 4.9. Assume that AA+ holds at all times, by the
necessary or sufficient conditions of Proposition 4.7. Then if
LAA+ :=
max
0≤∆≤π ≤1
2[πL1 + (1 − π )L0] + | f1(∆,π − ∆) − f0(∆,π − ∆)| < 1
(11)
holds, then society equalizes.
The proofs can be found in Appendix A. Note that while social
equality conditions for UN and AA– can be related, the conditions
for AA+ is not comparable to either of them in the sense that there
exist dynamics where one holds but the other does not.
4.3 Effect of Stereotypes
Everywhere in this paper, except in this subsection, the policymaker
is assumed to know exactly the distribution π of qualifications of
both groups. But the institution relies on its estimator F to identify
qualified individuals, errors in F translate to errors ϵ in estimates
of group qualifications and thus π̂ . As a result of these errors, it
becomes hard to properly impose fairness constraints, as even
selections rates per true groups are unknown. But the framework
allows one to investigate the effect of certain types of errors on the
dynamics.
At each time step t , define the errors in the qualification’s es-
timates as ϵAt and ϵBt such that −πt (1|A) ≤ ϵAt ≤ 1 − πt (1|A) and
−πt (1|B) ≤ ϵBt ≤ 1−πt (1|B). Then the institution has the following
qualification estimates:
π̂t (1|A) = πt (1|A) + ϵAt
π̂t (1|B) = πt (1|B) + ϵBt
Assume the errors are small enough that one can sill identify
which group truly is more qualified. This translates to having
ϵBt −ϵAt ≤ πt (1|A)−πt (1|B). Furthermore, restrict errors to be of the
form of positive or negative stereotypes. Concretely, if ϵBt ≤ 0, call
this negative stereotype, the institution identifies only
πt (1 |B)+ϵBt
πt (1 |B)
of qualified individuals and considers the rest unqualified. If ϵAt ≥ 0,
call this positive stereotype, then it identifies all qualified individ-
uals correctly and mistakes
ϵAt
πt (0 |A) of unqualified individuals as
qualified.
The institution bases its policy on these estimates, however in
terms of the actual distribution the implemented policy actually
differs.
If the policy acted upon is UN, meaning τ (1) = 1 and τ (0) = 0,
with a positive stereotype π̂ = π + ϵ ≥ π , the actual policy is:
τ (1) = 1, τ (0) = ϵ
1 − π
And with a negative stereotype π̂ = π + ϵ ≤ π :
τ (1) = π + ϵ
π
, τ (0) = 0
These policies are those that influence the next step distribution.
Note that in both cases the unconstrained condition for equality
might fail to hold as the difference in selection rates between the
two groups can be exaggerated.
Now consider that the institution applies affirmative action. In
the case of AA–
, surprisingly, given negative stereotype against
group B, no matter if group A’s qualification is overestimated or
underestimated, equality is reached under the same cases as if the
true distribution been known (no stereotypes). However, given a
positive stereotype for group B, then the conditions for equality
under AA–
derived previously are no longer sufficient. Thus the
AA– policy is robust to negative stereotypes against disadvantaged
groups.
On the other handwithAA+, with a negative bias against group A
and a positive bias for group B one can guarantee equality under the
same cases as without stereotypes. A further treatment of the actual
policies and analysis of the above conclusions is left to Appendix B.
5 DYNAMICS IN CONTINUOUS TIME
While discrete time (DT) describes successive selection-response
steps naturally, the arbitrary nature of the dynamics can lead to
sudden jumps and oscillatory behavior. These do not quite cor-
respond to how populations evolve in the real world, where one
expects change to happen gradually and slowly through time. Fig-
ure 2 shows the evolution of the percentage of bachelor degree
holders by sex in the United States of America. In 1967, 13% of men
25 years and older held a bachelor’s degree or higher while 8% of
women did [20]; this gap has decreased through time as degree
attainment increased for both sexes. In 2015, 33% of women held
a college degree compared to 32% of men, thus the proportion of
degree holders equalized between both sexes in 47 years time. One
of the reported reasons behind this increase has been attributed to
Title IX [19], a civil rights law passed in 1972 aiming to eliminate
discrimination in educational programs and the removal of quotas
against disadvantaged groups.
A change that is smooth and gradual can be modeled by trans-
forming the discrete time dynamics into continuous time (CT). The
transformation is standard, starting from dynamics (2) and dropping
group indices, one can rewrite it as a difference equation:
πt+1(1)−πt (1) = πt (1)
(
f1(βt (0), βt (1))−1
)
+ πt (0)f0(βt (0), βt (1))
1967 1973 1979 1985 1991 1997 2003 2009 2015
men
women
Figure 2: Percentage of the US population 25 years and older
holding a bachelor degree by sex from1967 till 2015, adapted
from [20].
Now assume that the difference from t to t + ∆t for all ∆t > 0 is
proportional to that from t to t + 1 (linear interpolation):
πt+∆t (1) − πt (1)
= ∆t ·
(
πt (1) (f1 (βt (0) , βt (1)) − 1) + πt (0) f0 (βt (0) , βt (1))
)
dividing by ∆t :
πt+∆t (1) − πt (1)
∆t
= πt (1)(f1(βt (0), βt (1))−1)+πt (0)f0(βt (0), βt (1))
Now taking the limit as ∆t → 0:
dπt
dt
= πt
(
f1 (βt (0) , βt (1))−1
)
+ (1 − πt ) f0 (βt (0) , βt (1)) (12)
The CT dynamics thus derived (12) can be motivated in two
ways. As is shown next, it maintains the properties of the DT dy-
namics regarding conditions leading to social equality. Moreover, it
possesses additional properties that greatly facilitate the analysis.
The proof of this and all the following lemmas can be found in
Appendix A.
Lemma 5.1. Assume the unconstrained policy is implemented in
both discrete time (DT) and continuous time (CT). If the sufficient con-
dition of Definition 4.3 for social equality holds for the DT dynamics
with equilibrium point πe , then the CT dynamics also converges to
πe starting from any initial condition.
The following shows that populations in CT, unlike in DT, main-
tain their order.
Lemma 5.2. Following either an unconstrained or affirmative ac-
tion policy in CT will preserve the initial advantage. For example, if
at t = 0, π0(1|B) ≤ π0(1|A) then for all t ≥ 0 πt (1|A) ≤ πt (1|B).
With Lemma 5.2, reaching equality with AA is straightforward
in CT if it does in DT.
Lemma 5.3. If an AA policy in DT reaches equality, then in CT
equality is likewise reached.
Thus to summarize, transitioning to CT does not break the con-
ditions previously derived for DT but in fact facilitates them. One
can additionally give a bound on the difference of the distributions
between groups at each time step:
Lemma 5.4. If the DT dynamics is contractive with constant L ∈
[0, 1), then under CT the difference between the distributions of both
groups ∆t = πt (1|A) − πt (1|B) at any time t obeys:
∆0e
−t (1+L) ≤ ∆t ≤ ∆0e
−t (1−L)
(13)
Motivated by these properties, in what follows the remainder
of the analysis of the behavior of the selection process on the
groups’ distributions due to the different policies is performed
under CT dynamics. The treatment could have initially started
with CT dynamics, however the setup is more intuitive in DT and
motivates the transition better.
6 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION UNDER NATURAL
EQUALITY
This section is concerned with the following scenario: assume that
using the unconstrained policy equality is reached, what can happen
if one instead follows an affirmative action policy? Even though
affirmative action may seem unnecessary, as without requiring fur-
ther intervention equality is reached, but can there be any additional
benefit to applying fairness constraints and is one guaranteed that
in this setting equality will also be reached? This is relevant since
the policy maker may not be aware of operating in this regime.
Formally, make the assumption that the dynamics under the
unconstrained policy (UN) is contractive with constant LUN < 1,
implying that there exists a globally attracting point πe . The precise
questions are then: Are the conditions for equality with affirmative
action also met? And how does the cumulative utility obtained
under AA policies compare to that under the UN policy?
Because in CT advantage is maintained (Lemma 5.2) and Propo-
sition 4.8 applies (Lemma 5.3), if AA–
holds initially it continues
to hold and the only remaining condition, which is therefore suffi-
cient, is Equation (10). It can be restated to require that the following
doesn’t hold for any π ∈ [0, 1]:
(f1(0,π ) = 1 ∧ f0(0,π ) = 0) ∨ (f1(0,π ) = 0 ∧ f0(0,π ) = 1).
The following then holds.
Theorem 6.1. If equality is reached with an unconstrained (UN)
policy then it is necessarily reached by an AA– policy, however with
no more, and possibly less, utility at each step.
Proof. Since equality is reached under the UN dynamics then
∀π ∈ [0, 1]:
| f ′(π )| ≤ LUN
where f ′ is the derivative of the dynamics under the UN policy.
Expanding in terms of the proposed dynamics:
| f1(0,π ) − f0(0,π ) + π f ′1 (0,π ) + (1 − π )f ′
where f ′
with respect to π .
Suppose | f1(0,π∗) − f0(0,π∗)| = 1 for some π∗ ∈ [0, 1]. If π∗ ∈
(0, 1) then since both f1 and f0 take values in [0, 1], then at π∗
one
attains its maximum and the other its minimum, thus f ′
and f ′
have 1 ≤ LUN.
Now suppose π∗ = 1, if f1(0,π∗) = 1 then f ′
the condition can’t be satisfied as one will have 1 + f ′
else if f1(0,π∗) = 0 then f ′
can’t be satisfied as | − 1+ f ′
π∗ = 0.
As the sufficient conditions for both AA– and UN to reach equal-
ity are satisfied, in CT the equilibrium point πe will be reached by
both policies, however their trajectories toward πe are different and
thus each achieves a different utility.
At each time-step t , to differentiate between the distributions
due to different policies denote by πt (1|A,UN) the distribution of
π (1|A) at time t due to the UN policy starting from t = 0, and
similarly for AA–. The utility of the UN policy at time t is:
Ut (UN) = дA · u(1) · πt (1|A,UN) + (1 − дA) · u(1) · πt (1|B,UN)
and that of AA– at time t is:
Ut (AA–) = дA · u(1) · πt (1|B,AA–) + (1 − дA) · u(1) · πt (1|B,AA–)
Consider the difference of the utilities:
Ut (UN) −Ut (AA–) =
дA · u(1) · πt (1|A,UN) + (1 − дA) · ·u(1) · πt (1|B,UN)
− (дA · u(1) · πt (1|B,AA–) + (1 − дA) · ·u(1) · πt (1|B,AA–))
Since under AA–
and UN the trajectory of π (1|B) is identical
then πt (1|B,AA–) = πt (1|B,UN), thus:
Ut (UN) −Ut (AA–) = дA · u(1) · (πt (1|A,UN) − πt (1|B,UN)
Following Proposition 5.2, one has that ∀t ≥ 0, πt (1|A,UN) −
πt (1|B,UN) ≥ 0, and thus the utility of the UN policy is always no
less than that of AA–. □
In light of this, the policy maker has no gain in enforcing affir-
mative action in this case.
Consider next howAA+ acts on the population in this setting. The
sufficient condition (11) for equality with the AA+ policy cannot be
directly implied from the UN equality. However, under AA+ group
A’s distribution trajectory will reach the equilibrium point πe as
the group’s policy is identical to the UN policy in CT. On the other
hand, group B’s distribution evolution through time is unclear. The
dynamics governing it is, with ∆(t) = πt (1|A,AA+) − πt (1|B,AA+):
dπt (1|B,AA+)
dt
= πt (1|B,AA+)f1(∆(t),πt (1|B,AA+) − ∆(t))
+ (1 − πt (1|B,AA+))f0(∆(t),πt (1|B,AA+) − ∆(t))
− πt (1|B,AA+).
Since πt (1|A,AA+) converges to πe as t → ∞, then ∆(t) will only
become a function of πt (1|B,AA+) and πe . Therefore, the dynamics
will approximately become an ODE with one variable, and oscilla-
tory behavior cannot exist in first order one dimensional ODEs [22],
then πt (1|B,AA+) will converge to some fixed point of the dynam-
ics necessarily below πe . Looking closely, if πe was initially below
π0(1|B,AA+), then the trajectory of πt (1|A,AA+) will force group
B to converge toward the equilibrium point. On the other hand,
if πe ≥ π0(1|B,AA+) then nothing can be said, thus unfortunately
only worse off equilibria are guaranteed.
Now let’s assume the conditions for reaching equality with the
AA+ policy are met to see what could be the consequence. Specifi-
cally there exists LAA+ ∈ [0, 1) such that for all π ,π ′
in [0, 1] one
has:
| fA(π ,π ′) − fB (π ,π ′)| ≤ LAA+ |π − π ′ |
Similarly to the discussion in the AA–
section, by comparing the
cumulative utility with UN one surprisingly finds a lifeline for
enforcing affirmative action.
Theorem 6.2. Let α = (1−дA)u(1)/((1−дA)u(1)+ |u(0)|). Assume
UN and AA+ both satisfy sufficient conditions (8) and (11) to reach
equality in DT, assuming remaining in the same case. Then if LUN
and LAA+ satisfy the following:
LUN ≥ 1 − α
and
LAA+ ≤ 1 + (LUN − 1)/α ,
Then AA+ provides more utility in CT over an infinite time horizon.
The proof can be found in Appendix A. This statement can be
roughly restated to be that if under AA+ equality is reached faster
than under the unconstrained policy, then AA+
results in a utility
gain. This implies that rather than trading off, speed of convergence
and utility go hand in hand.
7 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION UNDER
DISPARATE EQUILIBRIA
7.1 Multiple Equilibria
It is more realistic to expect that myopically maximizing utility
is unlikely to equalize the qualifications of groups. That is, one
expects following an unconstrained policy to not lead to equality.
To model this scenario, the dynamics should not have a unique
attracting equilibrium point. In general one could have arbitrarily
many, even infinitely many, fixed points for the dynamics. In this
section this is simplified to assuming that the dynamics under UN
has a finite number of attracting fixed points, each with its own
basin of attraction, and delimited by two repelling unstable fixed
points. Thus the UN policy would not equalize the groups unless
they are initially close enough to fall in the same basin. The notion
of such dynamics can be formalized as follows.
Definition 7.1 (k-Equilibrium Dynamics). A k-equilibrium map-
ping s a continuously differentiable function f : [0, 1] → [0, 1]
has k stable attracting points πe
for all i ∈ [k] and k + 1 limiting points δ0 = 0,δ1 ∈ (πe
(πe
e
k ) and δk = 1 such that for all π ∈
(δi−1,δi ) one has f n (π ) → πei as n → ∞. When i = 1, then the
corresponding interval becomes [0,δ1), when i = k , it is (δk−1, 1],
and finally if k = 1 the basin is [0, 1].
Figure 3 shows 3-equilibrium dynamics under an UN dynamics
with the direction of the gradient illustrated at each point. See
Appendix C for the specific pair (f0, f1).
For CT dynamics of the form:
dπ
dt
= f (πt ) − πt
to be k-equilibrium dynamics, necessary and sufficient conditions
on the function f are the following, ∀i ∈ [k]:
f (πei ) = πei
∀π ∈ (δi−1,πei ) : f (π ) > π , ∀π ∈ (πei ,δi ) : f (π ) < π (15)
This directly implies that πei for i ∈ [k] are asymptotically stable
fixed points and as a consequence δi ’s are unstable fixed points.
Figure 3: 3-equilibrium mapping under UN policy
To parallel the fact that conditions for CT thus far have mirrored
that in DT, note that these conditions are indeed necessary in DT
but not sufficient, because oscillations may result (an example is a
single equilibrium at 0.5 with f (π ) = 1 − π .) To make it work, it
suffices to modify condition (15) to:
∀π ∈ (δi−1,πei ) : π < f (π ) < πei , ∀π ∈ (πei ,δi ) : πei < f (π ) < π
(16)
and additionally require that there exists a neighborhood of radius
r i > 0 around every equilibrium point πei such that:
d f
dπ
≤ Li (17)
for some Li ∈ [0, 1) for all π ∈ [πei − r i ,πei + r
i ]. These are local
Lipschitz conditions that allow to control the rate of convergence
to the equilibrium points.
7.2 Eliminating Disparate Equilibria
The following shows that similarly to the single equilibrium UN,
the AA– policy is equalizing even under a k-equilibrium UN. Refer
to Appendix A for the proofs of this section,
Theorem 7.2. Assume status quo bias, i.e. Assumption 3.2. If f is
a k-equilibrium dynamics, as in Definition 7.1 that satisfies conditions
(16) and (17) under an UN policy in DT, then following AA– with the
DT dynamics reaches equality from any starting distribution. Since
necessary conditions for DT are sufficient for CT, the same holds also
for the CT dynamics.
The above theorem states that following AA–
is a guaranteed
way to reach equality, however equality comes at a price.
With only the necessary condition for a k-equilibrium dynamics
in CT (15) and assuming that AA–
holds AA–
leads to an eventual
population with utility no better than under UN.
On the other hand when following AA+
, equality will always
be beneficial. As before, under the conditions of a k-equilibrium
dynamics, one cannot deduce that the conditions for AA+
hold.
Assuming that these conditions do hold, it would actually guaran-
tee a utility no worse than following the UN policy. he following
Theorem characterizes this.
Theorem 7.3. If f is a k-equilibrium dynamics under UN in CT,
enforcing AA– results in an equilibrium where populations have a
utility value no higher (and possibly lower), while if the conditions for
equality under AA+ hold, enforcing AA+ will result in an equilibrium
where populations have a utility value no lower (and possibly higher)
compared to the limiting population under UN.
Figure 4 shows the difference between the gradient of πt under
either AA–
and AA+
and UN, for the dynamics which resulted in
Figure 3 in a 3-equilibrium UN. This can be shown to satisfy the
conditions to make the AA– and AA+ policies equalizing. Note how
the gradient difference for AA–
points generally downward and
leftward toward states with lower utility as opposed to that of AA+
which generally points upward and rightward toward equilibrium
points with higher utility. These illustrate qualitatively the kind of
behavior characterized in Theorem 7.3.

policies respectively under the same dynamics as that of Fig-

8 CONCLUSIONS
Imposing fairness considerations on decision making systems re-
quires understanding the influence that they will have on the popu-
lation at hand. Without knowledge of this influence, seemingly fair
constraints might in fact exacerbate existing differences between
groups of the population.
This paper proposed a simple but expressive model of a selection
process to concretely consider these concerns. Namely, affirmative
action was studied in terms of its ability to equalize the qualifica-
tions of different groups. Imposing one case of affirmative action
was shown to guarantee equality at the cost of worse institutional
utility and possibly decreasing the population’s overall qualification
level. In another case, however, affirmative action was shown to
lead to a policy with different characteristics: equality cannot be
directly guaranteed to hold but when it does, it results, in equilibria
where the population becomes more qualified.
This paper is certainly not the last word on the role of dynam-
ics in non-discrimination. The hope is to spur many new lines of
investigation. The proposed model and analysis could serve as a
framework to evaluate other non-discrimination constraints. More
ambitiously, it could be used to motivate and derive new constraints
with explicit awareness of their long term impact.
